Our new factorisation-based interior point solver, developed by Filippo Zanetti, is officially integrated in HiGHS! HiPO is multi-threaded and will improve the performance on many large instances. Metis and BLAS are required for HiPO. In this version, HiPO will be available when HiGHS is built from source with CMake. It can be accessed from C++, C and will also be available when HiGHS is called from JuMP. In a future release, HiPO will be available from Python, C# and more.\r\n\r\nForcing column reduction now checks the bound on the column dual rather than whether the dual row activity is zero fixing [#2409](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2409)\r\n\r\nNow handling correctly the case where an infeasible MIP has a feasible relaxation, so no ray is computed fixing [#2415](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2415)\r\n\r\nFixed minor bug exposed by [#2441](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2441) in `Highs::setSolution()` for a sparse user solution when the moidel is empty, and only clearing the dual data before solving with modified objective in `Highs::multiobjectiveSolve()` so that user-supplied solution is not cleared.\r\n\r\nThe irreducible infeasibility system (IIS) facility now detects infeasibility due to bounds on constraint activity values (implied by variable bounds) being incompatible with constraint bounds. A `kIisStrategyLight mode` for the `iis_strategy` option has been introduced so that only infeasibility due to incompatible variable/constraint bounds and constraint activity values is checked for. The LP corresponding to any known IIS is now formed and held as a data member of the `HighsIis` class. It can be obtained as a const reference using `Highs::getIisLp()`, and written to a file using `Highs::writeIisModel(const std::string& filename = \"\")`\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2463](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2463), the HiGHS solution and basis files now match data to any column and row names in the model, only assuming that the data are aligned with column and row indices if there are no names in the model. This requires a new version (v2) of the HiGHS basis file. Basis files from v1 are still read, but deprecated. Now, when writing out a model, basis or solution, column and row names are added to the model - previously they were created temporarily and inconsistentyly on the fly. If the model has existing names, then distinctive names are created to replace any blank names, but names with spaces or duplicate names yield an error status return.\r\n\r\nRefactored strong branching to minimize duplicated code\r\n\r\nOnly for LPs is there a choice of solver. Previously, when setting the `solver` option to anything other than \"choose\", any incumbent model was solved as an LP, using that LP solver. This has caused confusiuon for users, and is unnecessary now that there is the `solve_relaxation` option. Now, if the incumbent model is a QP or MIP, it is solved as such (unless `solve_relaxation` is true for a MIP), and the value of the `solver` option only determines what solver is used to solve an LP. If the value of `solver` is \"choose\", then HiGHS will use what it expects to be the best solver for the problem; if value of `solver` is \"ipm\", then HiGHS will use what it expects to be the better IPM solver (of HiPO and IPX) for the problem; if value of `solver` is \"hipo\", then HiGHS will use the HiPO IPM solver (if available in the build); if value of `solver` is \"ipx\", then HiGHS will use the IPX IPM solver; if value of `solver` is \"pdlp\", then HiGHS will use the PDLP first-order solver. The option `mip_lp_solver` has been introduced to define which LP solver is used when solving LPs in the MIP solver for which an advanced basis is not known - typically the \"root node\" LP. Note that The PDLP solver cannot be used to solve such LPs, since it does not yield a basic solution. If an interior point solver fails to obtain a basic solution, the simplex solver will then be used. The option `mip_ipm_solver` has been introduced to define which IPM solver is used when solving LPs in the MIP solver for which IPM is mandatory - typically the analytic centre calculation. When LPs are to be solved by an IPM solver, the HiPO solver is used (if available in the build) unless IPX has been specified explicitly. \r\n\r\nAs per [#2487](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2487), trivial heuristics now run before feasibility jump (FJ), and FJ will use any existing incumbent. FJ will clip any finite variable values in the incumbent to lower and upper bounds, and falls back to the existing logic (lower bound if finite, else upper bound if finite, else 0) for any infinite values in the incumbent.\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2460](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2460), the options `user_objective_scale` and `user_bound_scale` apply uniform (power-of-two) scaling to the objective and bounds of a model, and now respect the following restrictions\r\n- For a MIP, column bounds cannot be scaled, so the scaling is achieved by scaling the cost and constraint matrix column\r\n- For a QP, Hessian entries must be scaled down (up) when bounds are scaled up (down) so that all terms in the objective are scaled by a constant.\r\n\r\nFormerly the options `user_cost_scale` and `user_bound_scale` allowed uniform (power-of-two) scaling to the costs and bounds of an LP. The option `user_cost_scale` is now replaced by `user_objective_scale`.\r\n\r\nAfter HiGHS determines and logs the coefficient ranges and warns about extreme values, it recommends values of `user_objective_scale` and `user_bound_scale` if\r\n- All the objective coefficients (bound values) are smaller than the \"excessively small constant\" `kExcessivelySmallObjectiveCoefficient` (`kExcessivelySmallBoundValue`) - both of which are 1e-4 - suggesting that they are scaled up so that the largest value becomes (just over) the excessively small constant. Since the smallest value can be arbitrarily small, scaling so that this becomes (just over) the small constant is inadvisable, as the largest value could then be scaled up to an extremely large value.\r\n- All the objective coefficients (bound values) are larger than the \"excessively large constant\" `kExcessivelyLargeObjectiveCoefficient` (`kExcessivelyLargeBoundValue`) - both of which are 1e6 - suggesting that they are scaled down so that the largest value becomes (just over) the excessively large constant.\r\n\r\nThe recommended objective scaling is determined with respect to the recommended bound scaling\r\nUsers can obtain the recommended values of `user_objective_scale` and `user_bound_scale` by calling `Highs::getObjectiveBoundScaling`\r\n\r\nThe irreducible infeasibility system (IIS) facility now detects infeasibility due to bounds on constraint activity values being incompatible with constraint bounds. A `kIisStrategyLight` mode for the `iis_strategy` option has been introduced so that only infeasibility due to incompatible variable/constraint bounds and constraint activity values is checked for. The model corresponding to any known IIS is now formed and held as a data member of the `HighsIis` class. The `HighsIis` class is available via `highspy`, and its data members are available via the C API.\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2463](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2463), when HiGHS writes out a solution or basis for a model without column or row names, it creates names. This avoids a mis-match between the ordering of variables when such a model is written out as a .lp file, and then this and a solution or a basis is read in.\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2528](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2528), the logging for the HiGHS interior point method (IPM) solvers and PDLP solver has been standardised, and logging has been added to the IPM solver during time-consuming computational phases.\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2557](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2557), `Highs::getFixedLp` has been added so that, after solving a MIP, the LP with discrete variables fixed at their optimal values can be formed, allowing it to be passed to HiGHS and solved as an LP. \r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2581](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2581), the QP example in `call_highs_from_csharp.cs` has been corrected\r\n\r\nPrompted by [#2582](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2582), the C API constants are declared `static const` to prevent multiple definition linker errors\r\n\r\n## Build changes\r\n\r\nThe Bazel build now supports building with Cuda with an optional parameter `cupdlp_gpu`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/257246955/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":13,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/223527138","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/223527138/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/223527138/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/tag/v1.11.0","id":223527138,"author":{"login":"galabovaa","id":4016566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTY1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4016566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa","html_url":"https://github.com/galabovaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOB5HJRs4NUsDi","tag_name":"v1.11.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.11.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-06-06T00:22:05Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T00:32:34Z","published_at":"2025-06-06T00:31:53Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/assets/261405521","id":261405521,"node_id":"RA_kwDOB5HJRs4PlLtR","name":"source-archive.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":5095395,"digest":"sha256:41f393d0930018bd15034814c3fe625eddfde311da608fd3e7fb8b9fb7e6f4aa","download_count":8459,"created_at":"2025-06-06T00:32:34Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T00:32:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/download/v1.11.0/source-archive.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tarball/v1.11.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/zipball/v1.11.0","body":"## Build changes\r\n\r\nReplace command line parsing library with Cpp11 [#2211](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2211)\r\n\r\nCMake updates [#2286](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2286),

`Release/bin` replacing `bin/Release` [#2376](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2376)\r\n\r\n## Code changes\r\n\r\nFixed incorrect assertion in `HighsMipSolver::solutionFeasible()` (fixing [#2204](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2204))\r\n\r\nAs part of [#2251](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2251) cuPDLP-C will start from the incumbent solution in HiGHS. For a model that has been changed, the user must supply a starting solution via a call to `Highs::setSolution`\r\n\r\ngetColIntegrality now returns `HighsVarType::kContinuous` when `model_.lp_.integrality_` is empty (fixing [#2261](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2261))\r\n\r\nNow ensuring that when solving a scaled LP with useful but unvalidated basis, it does not lose its scaling after validation, since the scaling factors will be applied to the solution (fixing [#2267](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2267))\r\n\r\nBy setting non-empty values of options `read_solution_file`, `read_basis_file`, `write_model_file` (with extension `.lp` or `.mps`), `write_solution_file`, `solution_file`, `write_basis_file`, these files will be read or written when calling `Highs::run()`. Hence options previously only available via the command line interface can be use (for example) by modelling languages that only call `Highs::run()` (fixing [#2269](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2269)).\r\n\r\nBug [#2273](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2273) fixed\r\n\r\nAdded the feasibility jump heuristic as per [#1423](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/1423). This is on by default, but using the option `mip_heuristic_run_feasibility_jump=false` switches it off.\r\n\r\nZI rounding and shifting MIP primal heuristics have been added (see [#2287](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2287)). They are off by default, but can be activated by setting the options `mip_heuristic_run_zi_round` and `mip_heuristic_run_shifting` to be true. Options `mip_heuristic_run_rins`, `mip_heuristic_run_rens` and `mip_heuristic_run_root_reduced_cost` to run the RINS, RENS and rootReducedCost heuristics have been added. These are true by default, but setting them to be false can accelerate the MIP solver on easy problems.\r\n\r\nAdded `Highs_changeRowsBoundsByRange` to C API, fixing [#2296](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2296)\r\n\r\nCorrected docstrings for `Highs_getReducedRow`, motivated by [#2312](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2312)\r\n\r\nLP file reader no longer fails when there is no objective section. Fix is [#2316](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2316), but this exposes code quality issue [#2318](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2318)\r\n\r\nAdded a max scale factor (+1024) when scaling up coefficients in `preprocessBaseInequality` and `postprocessCut`. Fix is [#2337](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2337)\r\n\r\nCorrected the bounds used in when strengthening coefficients in `HPresolve::rowPresolve`, fixing [#1517](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/1517)\r\n\r\nFixed numerical error in `highs/mip/HighsCliqueTable.cpp`, closing [#2320](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2320)\r\n\r\nFixed bug in `highs/mip/HighsFeasibilityJump.cpp`, closing [#2331](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2331)\r\n\r\nTightened CMIR cuts, leading to small performance gain,  closing [#2333](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2333)\r\n\r\nScaling the tolerance in forcing row reduction to avoid use of rows with small coefficients and bounds,  closing [#2290](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2290)\r\n\r\nFixed bug when calculating a coefficient in one of the cuts in `separateImpliedBounds` in `highs/mip/HighsImplications.cpp`\r\n\r\nAdded `CSECTION` to the exceptions for keywords that are followed by text, and thus cannot be used as names of columns, RHS, ranges, bounds etc.\r\n\r\nIntroduced the following KKT error measures to `HighsInfo`: `num_relative_primal_infeasibilities`; `max_relative_primal_infeasibility`; `num_relative_dual_infeasibilities`; `max_relative_dual_infeasibility`; `num_primal_residual_errors`; `max_primal_residual_error`; `num_dual_residual_errors`; `max_dual_residual_error`; `num_relative_primal_residual_errors`; `max_relative_primal_residual_error`; `num_relative_dual_residual_errors`; `max_relative_dual_residual_error`; `num_complementarity_violations`; `max_complementarity_violation`; `primal_dual_objective_error.` The relative values are used to assess whether a solution deemed to be optimal by the first order LP solver `cuPDLP-C` or interior point solver `IPX` (without crossover) is truly acceptable. They also enable users to determine whether a solution corresponding to `HighsModelStatus::kUnknown` is acceptable to them as optimal. Also introduced options `complementarity_tolerance` used to assess whether the (relative) primal-dual objective error is acceptable, and `kkt_tolerance` which, if set to a value other than `kDefaultKktTolerance = 1e-7` is used as the tolerance for all the KKT error measures. The HiGHS documentation has been updated to reflect the new options and `HighsInfo` data, and logging messages indicate when KKT error measures are not satisfied, despite the solver considering the LP solution to be optimal.\r\n\r\nAdded a max scale factor (+1024) when scaling up coefficients in `preprocessBaseInequality` and `postprocessCut`.

Ours is currently only a serial CPU implementation, so performance isn't spectacular, but we aim to offer the GPU implementation in due course. To run PDLP, choose the option solver=pdlp. Note that there is currently no time-out available for PDLP, and the termination criteria for cuPDLP-c may mean that the HiGHS optimality conditions are not satisfied. See [README.md](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tree/master/src/pdlp/cupdlp/README.md) .\r\n\r\nThe HiGHS interior point solver now allows analytic centre calculations to be performed. This is done by setting the HiGHS option run_centring to be true. Other new options allow the centring calculations to be controlled.\r\n\r\nWhen Highs::run() is called, ranges of the matrix, costs, bounds and RHS are reported, together with advice on setting the new HiGHS options user_cost_scale and used_bound_scale if there are extreme values.\r\n\r\nAfter solving an LP, the method Highs::getIllConditioning tries (in an approach similar to that used by Gurobi) to identify constraints or basic variables that contribute most to ill-conditioning of the basis matrix.\r\n\r\nLogging from the interior point solver is now consistent with logging from the simplex and MIP solvers.\r\n\r\nThe Python interface has been updated, with several overlooked methods having been added\r\n\r\nConsiderable modifications and fixes have been added to the build system, in particular for Python. highspy is no longer built with meson, rather a combination of setuptools and cmake.\r\n\r\nBugs in the QP and MIP solvers have been fixed\r\n\r\nThanks are due to due to @fwesselm @feldmeier and @Coloquinte","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/145189166/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":3},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/tag/v1.6.0","id":123066411,"author":{"login":"galabovaa","id":4016566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTY1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4016566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa","html_url":"https://github.com/galabovaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOB5HJRs4HVdgr","tag_name":"v1.6.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.6.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-09-28T14:59:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T17:26:20Z","published_at":"2023-09-29T05:31:06Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tarball/v1.6.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/zipball/v1.6.0","body":"Added [logging, improving solution and interrupt callbacks](https://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/stable/callbacks/) to C++ and C for a single user-defined callback method.

have been made to improve the reliability of the IPM solver when cross-over is not always run - carried out for benchmarking purposes. This has required the `run_crossover` option that was previously Boolean to become a string with possible values \"on\", \"off\" and \"choose\". The latter results in crossover being run if the result of IPM without crossover is imprecise.\r\n\r\nHiGHS will now allow a solution to be read from a file when running HiGHS from the command line, and handle the case where a user has supplied a partial (discrete) solution to a MIP. If the supplied solution is not feasible, HiGHS will fix the discrete variables and attempt to find a feasible assignment of the continuous variables by solving an LP.\r\n\r\nIf the incumbent model has discrete variables, then the MIP is solved regardless of the setting of the `solve` option. Previously if `solve` were \"simplex\" or \"ipm\" then the relaxation would be solved. To force the relaxation to be solved, set the (new) `solve_relaxation` option (default \"false\") to be true.\r\n\r\nVarious bug fixes, notably time limit introduced into redundant equations rule for
