For a model that has been changed, the user must supply a starting solution via a call to `Highs::setSolution`\r\n\r\ngetColIntegrality now returns `HighsVarType::kContinuous` when `model_.lp_.integrality_` is empty (fixing [#2261](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2261))\r\n\r\nNow ensuring that when solving a scaled LP with useful but unvalidated basis, it does not lose its scaling after validation, since the scaling factors will be applied to the solution (fixing [#2267](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2267))\r\n\r\nBy setting non-empty values of options `read_solution_file`, `read_basis_file`, `write_model_file` (with extension `.lp` or `.mps`), `write_solution_file`, `solution_file`, `write_basis_file`, these files will be read or written when calling `Highs::run()`. Hence options previously only available via the command line interface can be use (for example) by modelling languages that only call `Highs::run()` (fixing [#2269](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2269)).\r\n\r\nBug [#2273](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2273) fixed\r\n\r\nAdded the feasibility jump heuristic as per [#1423](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/1423). This is on by default, but using the option `mip_heuristic_run_feasibility_jump=false` switches it off.\r\n\r\nZI rounding and shifting MIP primal heuristics have been added (see [#2287](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2287)). They are off by default, but can be activated by setting the options `mip_heuristic_run_zi_round` and `mip_heuristic_run_shifting` to be true. Options `mip_heuristic_run_rins`, `mip_heuristic_run_rens` and `mip_heuristic_run_root_reduced_cost` to run the RINS, RENS and rootReducedCost heuristics have been added. These are true by default, but setting them to be false can accelerate the MIP solver on easy problems.\r\n\r\nAdded `Highs_changeRowsBoundsByRange` to C API, fixing [#2296](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2296)\r\n\r\nCorrected docstrings for `Highs_getReducedRow`, motivated by [#2312](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2312)\r\n\r\nLP file reader no longer fails when there is no objective section.

Fix is [#2337](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2337)\r\n\r\nCorrected the bounds used in when strengthening coefficients in `HPresolve::rowPresolve`, fixing [#1517](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/1517)\r\n\r\nFixed numerical error in `highs/mip/HighsCliqueTable.cpp`, closing [#2320](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2320)\r\n\r\nFixed bug in `highs/mip/HighsFeasibilityJump.cpp`, closing [#2331](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2331)\r\n\r\nTightened CMIR cuts, leading to small performance gain,  closing [#2333](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2333)\r\n\r\nScaling the tolerance in forcing row reduction to avoid use of rows with small coefficients and bounds,  closing [#2290](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/2290)\r\n\r\nFixed bug when calculating a coefficient in one of the cuts in `separateImpliedBounds` in `highs/mip/HighsImplications.cpp`\r\n\r\nAdded `CSECTION` to the exceptions for keywords that are followed by text, and thus cannot be used as names of columns, RHS, ranges, bounds etc.\r\n\r\nIntroduced the following KKT error measures to `HighsInfo`: `num_relative_primal_infeasibilities`; `max_relative_primal_infeasibility`; `num_relative_dual_infeasibilities`; `max_relative_dual_infeasibility`; `num_primal_residual_errors`; `max_primal_residual_error`; `num_dual_residual_errors`; `max_dual_residual_error`; `num_relative_primal_residual_errors`; `max_relative_primal_residual_error`; `num_relative_dual_residual_errors`; `max_relative_dual_residual_error`; `num_complementarity_violations`; `max_complementarity_violation`; `primal_dual_objective_error.` The relative values are used to assess whether a solution deemed to be optimal by the first order LP solver `cuPDLP-C` or interior point solver `IPX` (without crossover) is truly acceptable. They also enable users to determine whether a solution corresponding to `HighsModelStatus::kUnknown` is acceptable to them as optimal. Also introduced options `complementarity_tolerance` used to assess whether the (relative) primal-dual objective error is acceptable, and `kkt_tolerance` which, if set to a value other than `kDefaultKktTolerance = 1e-7` is used as the tolerance for all the KKT error measures. The HiGHS documentation has been updated to reflect the new options and `HighsInfo` data, and logging messages indicate when KKT error measures are not satisfied, despite the solver considering the LP solution to be optimal.\r\n\r\nAdded a max scale factor (+1024) when scaling up coefficients in `preprocessBaseInequality` and `postprocessCut`. Fix is [#2337](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/pull/2337).\r\n\r\nRenamed `HighsOptions::pdlp_d_gap_tol` to `HighsOptions::pdlp_optimality_tolerance` for consistency with IPM\r\n\r\nRenamed `HighsOptions::complementarity_tolerance` to `HighsOptions::optimality_tolerance` for consistency with IPM and PDLP\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/223527138/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":5,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/207213846","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/207213846/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/207213846/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/tag/v1.10.0","id":207213846,"author":{"login":"galabovaa","id":4016566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTY1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4016566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa","html_url":"https://github.com/galabovaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOB5HJRs4MWdUW","tag_name":"v1.10.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.10.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-03-20T15:12:03Z","published_at":"2025-03-20T15:42:25Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/assets/239287319","id":239287319,"node_id":"RA_kwDOB5HJRs4OQzwX","name":"source-archive.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":5018558,"digest":null,"download_count":4031,"created_at":"2025-03-20T15:43:13Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T15:43:14Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/download/v1.10.0/source-archive.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tarball/v1.10.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/zipball/v1.10.0","body":"## Build changes\r\n\r\nAdded code coverage report\r\n\r\nReplaced command line parsing library with CLI11.

To determine the sizes of the vectors of data, the method is called without specifying pointers to the data arrays.\r\n\r\nAdded documentation on the use of presolve when solving an incumbent model, and clarifying the use of the method `Highs::presolve`.\r\n\r\nHiGHS will now read a `MIPLIB` solution file\r\n\r\nAdded time limit check to `HPresolve::strengthenInequalities`\r\n\r\nAdded `getColIntegrality` to `highspy`\r\n\r\nNow computing the primal-dual integral, reporting it, and making it available as `HighsInfo::primal_dual_integral`\r\n\r\nTrivial primal heuristics \"all zero\", \"all lower bound\", \"all upper bound\", and \"lock point\" added to the MIP solver\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/185237497/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":7,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/180543998","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/180543998/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/180543998/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/tag/v1.8.0","id":180543998,"author":{"login":"galabovaa","id":4016566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTY1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4016566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa","html_url":"https://github.com/galabovaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOB5HJRs4KwuH-","tag_name":"v1.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.8.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-10-17T21:23:29Z","published_at":"2024-10-17T23:20:20Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tarball/v1.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/zipball/v1.8.0","body":"## Code updates\r\n\r\nWe believe that the issue of HiGHS \"hanging\" when run on Windows with `threads` not equal to 1 has been fixed!\r\n\r\nAdded `int64_t mip_total_lp_iterations` to `HighsCallbackDataOut` and modified accessor function\r\n\r\n`Highs::writeSolution` and `Highs::writeBasis` now being done via `HighsIO` logging, so can be redirected to logging callback.\r\n\r\nIntroduced `const double kHighsUndefined` as value of undefined values in a user solution.

Note that there is currently no time-out available for PDLP, and the termination criteria for cuPDLP-c may mean that the HiGHS optimality conditions are not satisfied.

have been made to improve the reliability of the IPM solver when cross-over is not always run - carried out for benchmarking purposes. This has required the `run_crossover` option that was previously Boolean to become a string with possible values \"on\", \"off\" and \"choose\". The latter results in crossover being run if the result of IPM without crossover is imprecise.\r\n\r\nHiGHS will now allow a solution to be read from a file when running HiGHS from the command line, and handle the case where a user has supplied a partial (discrete) solution to a MIP. If the supplied solution is not feasible, HiGHS will fix the discrete variables and attempt to find a feasible assignment of the continuous variables by solving an LP.\r\n\r\nIf the incumbent model has discrete variables, then the MIP is solved regardless of the setting of the `solve` option. Previously if `solve` were \"simplex\" or \"ipm\" then the relaxation would be solved. To force the relaxation to be solved, set the (new) `solve_relaxation` option (default \"false\") to be true.\r\n\r\nVarious bug fixes, notably time limit introduced into redundant equations rule for
