A new validator to check for files on a default path is included to allow one or more default paths for configuration files or other file arguments. A number of bug fixes and code cleanup for various build configurations.  Clean up of some error outputs and extension of existing capability to new types or situations.\r\n\r\nThere is a possible minor breaking change in behavior of certain types which wrapped an integer, such as `std::atomic<int>` or `std::optional<int>` when used in a flag.  The default behavior is now as a single argument value vs. summing all the arguments.  The default summing behavior is now restricted to pure integral types, int64_t, int, uint32_t, etc.  Use the new `sum` multi option policy to revert to the older behavior.  The summing behavior on wrapper types was not originally intended.\r\n\r\n* Add `MultiOptionPolicy::Sum`  and refactor the `add_flag` to fix a bug when using `std::optional<bool>` as type. [#709][]\r\n* Add support for an empty vector result in TOML and as a default string. [#660][]\r\n* Add `.validate_optional_arguments()` to support discriminating positional arguments from vector option arguments. [#668][]\r\n* Add `CLI::FileOnDefaultPath` to check for files on a specified default path. [#698][]\r\n* Change default value display in help messages from `=XXXX` to `[XXXXX]` to make it clearer. [#666][]\r\n* Modify the Range Validator to support additional types and clean up the error output. [#690][]\r\n* Bugfix: The trigger on parse modifier did not work on positional arguments. [#713][]\r\n* Bugfix: The single header file generation was missing custom namespace generation. [#707][]\r\n* Bugfix: Clean up File Error handling in the argument processing. [#678][]\r\n* Bugfix: Fix a stack overflow error if nameless commands had fallthrough. [#665][]\r\n* Bugfix: A subcommand callback could be executed multiple times if it was a member of an option group. [#666][]\r\n* Bugfix: Fix an issue with vectors of multi argument types where partial argument sets did not result in an error. [#661][]\r\n* Bugfix: Fix an issue with type the template matching on C++20 and add some CI builds for C++20. [#663][]\r\n* Bugfix: Fix typo in C++20 detection on MSVC. [#706][]\r\n* Bugfix: An issue where the detection of RTTI being disabled on certain MSVC platforms did not disable the use of dynamic cast calls. [#666][]\r\n* Bugfix: Resolve strict-overflow warning on some GCC compilers. [#666][]\r\n* Backend: Add additional tests concerning the use of aliases for option groups in config files.

handling has been completely replaced by a new backend that works as a Validator or Transformer. This provides a single interface instead of the 16 different functions in App. It also allows ordered collections to be used, custom functions for filtering, and better help and error messages. You can also use a collection of pairs (like `std::map`) to transform the match into an output. Also new are inverted flags, which can cancel or reduce the count of flags, and can also support general flag types. A new `add_option_fn` lets you more easily program CLI11 options with the types you choose. Vector options now support a custom separator. Apps can now be composed with unnamed subcommand support. The final bool \"defaults\" flag when creating options has been replaced by `->capture_default_str()` (ending an old limitation in construction made this possible); the old method is still available but may be removed in future versions.\r\n\r\n* Replaced default help capture: `.add_option(\"name\", value, \"\", True)` becomes `.add_option(\"name\", value)->capture_default_str()` [#242]\r\n* Added `.always_capture_default()` [#242]\r\n* New `CLI::IsMember` validator replaces set validation [#222]\r\n* IsMember also supports container of pairs, transform allows modification of result [#228]\r\n* Added new Transformers, `CLI::AsNumberWithUnit` and `CLI::AsSizeValue` [#253]\r\n* Much more powerful flags with different values [#211], general types [#235]\r\n* `add_option` now supports bool due to unified bool handling [#211]\r\n* Support for composable unnamed subcommands [#216]\r\n* Reparsing is better supported with `.remaining_for_passthrough()` [#265]\r\n* Custom vector separator using `->delimiter(char)` [#209], [#221], [#240]\r\n* Validators added for IP4 addresses and positive numbers [#210] and numbers [#262]\r\n* Minimum required Boost for optional Optionals has been corrected to 1.61 [#226]\r\n* Positionals can stop options from being parsed with `app.positionals_at_end()` [#223]\r\n* Added `validate_positionals` [#262]\r\n* Positional parsing is much more powerful [#251], duplicates supported []#247]\r\n* Validators can be negated with `!` [#230], and now handle tname functions [#228]\r\n* Better enum support and streaming helper [#233] and [#228]\r\n* Cleanup for shadow warnings [#232]\r\n* Better alignment on multiline descriptions [#269]\r\n* Better support for aarch64 [#266]\r\n* Respect `BUILD_TESTING` only if CLI11 is the main project; otherwise, `CLI11_TESTING` must be used [#277]\r\n* Drop auto-detection of experimental optional and boost::optional; must be enabled explicitly (too fragile) [#277] [#279]\r\n\r\n> ### Converting from CLI11 1.7:\r\n>\r\n> * `.add_option(..., true)` should be replaced by `.add_option(...)->capture_default_str()` or `app.option_defaults()->always_capture_default()` can be used\r\n> * `app.add_set(\"--name\", value, {\"choice1\", \"choice2\"})` should become `app.add_option(\"--name\", value)->check(CLI::IsMember({\"choice1\", \"choice2\"}))`\r\n> * The `_ignore_case` version of this can be replaced by adding `CLI::ignore_case` to the argument list in `IsMember`\r\n> * The `_ignore_underscore` version of this can be replaced by adding `CLI::ignore_underscore` to the argument list in `IsMember`\r\n> * The `_ignore_case_underscore` version of this can be replaced by adding both functions listed above to the argument list in `IsMember`\r\n> * If you want an exact match to the original choice after one of the modifier functions matches, use `->transform` instead of `->check`\r\n> * The `_mutable` versions of this can be replaced by passing a pointer or shared pointer into `IsMember`\r\n> * An error with sets now produces a `ValidationError` instead of a `ConversionError`\r\n\r\n[#209]: https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/209\r\n[#210]:

parsing procedure now maps much more sensibly to complex, nested subcommand structures. Each phase of the parsing happens on all subcommands before moving on with the next phase of the parse. This allows several features, like required environment variables, to work properly even through subcommand boundaries.\r\nPassing the same subcommand multiple times is better supported. Several new features were added as well, including Windows style option support, parsing strings directly, and ignoring underscores in names. Adding a set that you plan to change later must now be done with `add_mutable_set`.\r\n\r\n* Support Windows style options with `->allow_windows_style_options`. [#187] On by default on Windows. [#190]\r\n* Added `parse(string)` to split up and parse a command-line style string directly. [#186]\r\n* Added `ignore_underscore` and related functions, to ignore underscores when matching names. [#185]\r\n* The default INI Config will now add quotes to strings with spaces [#195]\r\n* The default message now will mention the help-all flag also if present [#197]\r\n* Added `->description` to set Option descriptions [#199]\r\n* Mutating sets (introduced in Version 1.6) now have a clear add method, `add_mutable_set*`, since the set reference should not expire [#200]\r\n* Subcommands now track how many times they were parsed in a parsing process. `count()` with no arguments will return the number of times a subcommand was encountered. [#179]\r\n* Parsing is now done in phases: `shortcurcuits`, `ini`, `env`, `callbacks`, and `requirements`; all subcommands complete a phase before moving on. [#179]\r\n* Calling parse multiple times is now officially supported without `clear` (automatic). [#179]\r\n* Dropped the mostly undocumented `short_circuit` property, as help flag parsing is a bit more complex, and the default callback behavior of options now works properly. [#179]\r\n* Use the standard `BUILD_TESTING` over `CLI11_TESTING` if defined (`CLI11_TESTING` may eventually be removed) [#183]\r\n* Cleanup warnings [#191]\r\n* Remove deprecated names: `set_footer`, `set_name`, `set_callback`, and `set_type_name`.

Most caveats about features only working on the main App have been addressed, and extra arguments have been reworked. Inheritance of defaults makes configuring CLI11 much easier without having to subclass. Policies add new ways to handle multiple arguments to match your favorite CLI programs. Error messages and help messages are better and more flexible. Several bugs and odd behaviors in the parser have been fixed.\r\n\r\n* Added a version macro, `CLI11_VERSION`, along with `*_MAJOR`, `*_MINOR`, and `*_PATCH`, for programmatic access to the version.\r\n* Reworked the way defaults are set and inherited; explicit control given to user with `->option_defaults()` [#48](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/48)\r\n* Hidden options now are based on an empty group name, instead of special \"hidden\" keyword [#48](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/48)\r\n* `parse` no longer returns (so `CLI11_PARSE` is always usable) [#37](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/37)\r\n* Added `remaining()` and `remaining_size()` [#37](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/37)\r\n* `allow_extras` and `prefix_command` are now valid on subcommands [#37](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/37)\r\n* Added `take_last` to only take last value passed [#40](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/40)\r\n* Added `multi_option_policy` and shortcuts to provide more control than just a take last policy [#59](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/59)\r\n* More detailed error messages in a few cases [#41](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/41)\r\n* Footers can be added to help [#42](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/42)\r\n* Help flags are easier to customize [#43](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/43)\r\n* Subcommand now support groups [#46](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/46)\r\n* `CLI::RuntimeError` added, for easy exit with error codes [#45](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/45) \r\n* The clang-format script is now no longer \"hidden\" [#48](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/48)\r\n* The order is now preserved for subcommands (list and callbacks) [#49](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/49)\r\n* Tests now run individually, utilizing CMake 3.10 additions if possible [#50](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/50)\r\n* Failure messages are now customizable, with a shorter default [#52](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/52)\r\n* Some improvements to error codes [#53](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/53)\r\n* `require_subcommand` now offers a two-argument form and negative values on the one-argument form are more useful [#51](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/51)\r\n* Subcommands no longer match after the max required number is obtained [#51](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/51)\r\n* Unlimited options no longer prioritize over remaining/unlimited positionals [#51](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/51)\r\n* Added `->transform` which modifies the string parsed [#54](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/54)\r\n* Changed of API in validators to `void(std::string &)` (const for users), throwing providing nicer errors [#54](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/54)\r\n* Added `CLI::ArgumentMismatch` [#56](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/56) and fixed missing failure if one arg expected [#55](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/issues/55)\r\n* Support for minimum unlimited expected arguments [#56](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/56)\r\n* Single internal arg parse function [#56](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/56)\r\n* Allow options to be disabled from INI file, rename `add_config` to `set_config` [#60](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/pull/60)\r\n\r\n> ### Converting from CLI11 1.2:\r\n> \r\n> * `app.parse` no longer returns a vector.
