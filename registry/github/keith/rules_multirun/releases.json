This is useful if you have many commands which produce confusing interleaved output.\r\n- Add `keep_going` attribute to `multirun`, disabled by default. This allows you to run all commands even if some fail to see all failure output. The downside is if you have long running commands and if you don't care about later commands succeeding if the earlier commands fail, you might waste runtime.\r\n- Add `description` to `command` which is printed instead of the default label with `print_command = True` on `multirun`\r\n- Improve documentation, visible [here](https://github.com/keith/rules_multirun/tree/main/doc)\r\n- Add bzl_library targets for stardoc\r\n\r\n`MODULE.bazel` setup:\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_multirun\", version = \"0.7.0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`WORKSPACE` setup:\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_multirun\",\r\n    sha256 = \"7b699b3922919d727e7f5aa868286e59cc69fa6aa14f6c3e54a4674010bd1582\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_multirun-0.7.0\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/keith/rules_multirun/releases/download/0.7.0/rules_multirun-0.7.0.tar.gz\",\r\n)\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith/rules_multirun/releases/109603669","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith/rules_multirun/releases/109603669/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/keith/rules_multirun/releases/109603669/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/keith/rules_multirun/releases/tag/0.6.1","id":109603669,"author":{"login":"keith","id":283886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Mzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith","html_url":"https://github.com/keith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOHUHStM4GiGtV","tag_name":"0.6.1","target_commitish":"main","name":"0.6.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-06-22T19:35:59Z","published_at":"2023-06-22T19:37:01Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith/rules_multirun/tarball/0.6.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith/rules_multirun/zipball/0.6.1","body":"- Fix running commands that are in the root `BUILD` file.
