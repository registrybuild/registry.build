Added `EVP_KDF_CTX_set_SKEY()`,\r\n    `EVP_KDF_derive_SKEY()`, and `EVP_PKEY_derive_SKEY()` functions.\r\n\r\n  * Added LMS signature verification support as per [SP 800-208].

OpenSSL 3.6.0 is a feature pre-release adding significant new functionality to openssl\r\n\r\nThis release incorporates the following features, bug fixes and mitigations:\r\n\r\n * Added PCT for key

symmetric key objects to the key\r\n    derivation and key exchange provider methods. Added `EVP_KDF_CTX_set_SKEY()`,\r\n    `EVP_KDF_derive_SKEY()`, and `EVP_PKEY_derive_SKEY()` functions.\r\n\r\n  * The FIPS provider now performs a PCT on key import for RSA, EC and ECX.\r\n    This is mandated by FIPS 140-3 IG 10.3.A additional comment 1.\r\n\r\n  * Added LMS signature verification support as per [SP 800-208]. This\r\n    support is present in both the FIPS and default providers.\r\n\r\n  * An ANSI-C toolchain is no longer sufficient for building OpenSSL. The code\r\n    should build on compilers supporting C-99 features.\r\n\r\n  * The VxWorks platforms have been removed.\r\n\r\n  * Added an `openssl configutl` utility for processing the openssl\r\n    configuration file and dumping the equal configuration file.\r\n\r\n  * Added support for FIPS 186-5 deterministic ECDSA signature\r\n    generation to the FIPS provider.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated

OpenSSL 3.5.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to\r\nOpenSSL.\r\n\r\nThis release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible\r\nchanges:\r\n\r\n  * Default encryption cipher for the `req`, `cms`, and `smime` applications\r\n    changed from `des-ede3-cbc` to `aes-256-cbc`.\r\n\r\n  * The default TLS supported groups list has been changed to include and\r\n    prefer hybrid PQC KEM groups. Some practically unused groups were removed\r\n    from the default list.\r\n\r\n  * The default TLS keyshares have been changed to offer X25519MLKEM768 and\r\n    and X25519.\r\n\r\n  * All `BIO_meth_get_*()` functions were deprecated.\r\n\r\nThis release adds the following new features:\r\n\r\n  * Support for server side QUIC (RFC 9000)\r\n\r\n  * Support for 3rd party QUIC stacks including 0-RTT support\r\n\r\n  * Support for PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA)\r\n\r\n  * A new configuration option `no-tls-deprecated-ec` to disable support for\r\n    TLS groups deprecated in RFC8422\r\n\r\n  * A new configuration option `enable-fips-jitter` to make the FIPS provider\r\n    to use the `JITTER` seed source\r\n\r\n  * Support for central key generation in CMP\r\n\r\n  * Support added for opaque symmetric key objects (EVP_SKEY)\r\n\r\n  * Support for multiple TLS keyshares and improved TLS key establishment group\r\n    configurability\r\n\r\n  * API support for pipelining in provided cipher algorithms\r\n \r\nKnown issues in 3.5.0\r\n\r\n  * <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/27282>\r\n    Calling SSL_accept on objects returned from SSL_accept_connection\r\n    results in error.  It is expected that making this call will advance\r\n    the SSL handshake for the passed connection, but currently it does not.\r\n    This can be handled by calling SSL_do_handshake instead.

3.5.0-alpha1 is a feature pre-release adding significant new functionality to\r\nOpenSSL.\r\n\r\nThis release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible\r\nchanges:\r\n\r\n  * Default encryption cipher for the `req`, `cms`, and `smime` applications\r\n    changed from `des-ede3-cbc` to `aes-256-cbc`.\r\n\r\n  * The TLS supported groups list has been changed in favor of PQC support.\r\n\r\n  * The default TLS keyshares have been changed to offer X25519MLKEM768 and\r\n    and X25519.\r\n\r\nThis release adds the following new features:\r\n\r\n  * Support for server side QUIC (RFC 9000)\r\n\r\n  * Support for 3rd party QUIC stacks\r\n\r\n  * Support for PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA)\r\n\r\n  * Allow the FIPS provider to optionally use the `JITTER` seed source.\r\n    Because this seed source is not part of the OpenSSL FIPS validations,\r\n    it should only be enabled after the [jitterentropy-library] has been\r\n    assessed for entropy quality.  Moreover, the FIPS provider including\r\n    this entropy source will need to obtain an [ESV] from the [CMVP] before\r\n    FIPS compliance can be claimed.
