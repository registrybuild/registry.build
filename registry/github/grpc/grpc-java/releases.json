in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n * New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * api: Add `ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)` (960012d76). This is the same as the existing `inboundHeaders()`, but is provided the Metadata\r\n * api: Fix various typos in the documentation (#11144) (6ec744f2a)\r\n * core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code\r\n * util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (#11139) (781b4c457) This change shows `@ExperimentalApi` being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release\r\n * examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (#11131) (c31dbf48a)\r\n * binder: Add a connection timeout (#11255) (791f894e2)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n * core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible\r\n * netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (#11294) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption\r\n * okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19). Previously, shutting down when a new connection was being established could result in the server never becoming terminated\r\n * inprocess: Fix listener race if transport is shutdown while starting (e4e7f3a06). This issue was unlikely to be hit outside of specialized tests\r\n * services: restore //services:binarylog bazel target (#11292) (d57f271). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.62.2\r\n * binder: Wait for all server transports to terminate before returning the security policy executor to the object pool (#11240) (34ee600dc)\r\n * binder: Reject further SETUP_TRANSPORT requests post-BinderServer shutdown (#11260) (1670e97f7)\r\n * bazel: Include missing com_google_protobuf_javalite in MODULE.bazel (#11147) (f995c121e)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@hakusai22\r\n@firov\r\n@mateusazis\r\n@Mir3605\r\n@niloc132\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/163040246/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":5},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.63.1","id":156308705,"author":{"login":"sergiitk","id":672669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjY2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/672669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk","html_url":"https://github.com/sergiitk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4JURTh","tag_name":"v1.63.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-05-16T20:53:38Z","published_at":"2024-05-17T17:15:26Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.63.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.63.1","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n - netty: Release SendGrpcFrameCommand when stream is missing (#11116) (fb9a10809)\r\n - Change defaults to use the older PickFirstLoadBalancer and disable Happy Eyeballs.

For Netty 4.1.111 compatibility, it is best to use 1.63.2, 1.64.2, 1.65.1, and later. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11284 ._\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n - compiler: the option `jakarta_omit` was renamed `@generated=omit` (#11086) (8a21afcc9)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n - New API LoadBalancer.getChannelTarget() (4561bb5b8)\r\n - opentelemetry: Publish new module grpc-opentelemetry (5ba1a5563). The feature is still missing documentation and an example. It only supports metrics; tracing and logs will be future enhancements. See [gRFC A66](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A66-otel-stats.md)\r\n - bazel: Add support for bzlmod (#11046) (d1890c0ac)\r\n - bazel: Replace usages of the old compatibility maven targets with `@maven` targets (00649913b)\r\n - okhttp: Support serverBuilder.maxConcurrentCallsPerConnection (Fixes #11062). (#11063) (805072339)\r\n - xds: Experimental metrics recording in WRR LB (06df25b65, 35a171bc1, 2897b3939), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry. See [gRFC A78](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A78-grpc-metrics-wrr-pf-xds.md)\r\n - rls: Experimental metrics recording in RLS LB (a9fb272b7, a1d19327f, 813331837), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n - examples: support bazel build for retry policy example (58de563fa)\r\n - netty: Allow deframer errors to close stream with a status code, as long as headers have not yet been sent (e036b1b19). This will greatly improve the debuggability of certain server errors in particular cases. Instead of the client seeing “CANCELLED: RST_STREAM closed stream. HTTP/2 error code: CANCEL”, they could see “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size 4194304: 6144592”\r\n - netty: Improve handling of unexpected write queue promise failures (#11016)\r\n - servlet: Avoid unnecessary FINEST hex string conversion by checking log level. Fixes #11031. (f7ee5f318)\r\n - StatusException/StatusRuntimeException hide stack trace in a simpler way (#11064) (e36f099be)\r\n - util: Status desc for outlier detection ejection (#11036) (10cb4a3be)\r\n - binder: Helper class to allow in process servers to use peer uids in test (#11014) (537dbe826)\r\n - Add `load()` statements for the Bazel builtin top-level java symbols (#11105) (add8c37a4)\r\n - Add `StatusProto.toStatusException` overload to accept `Throwable` (#11083) (5c9b49231)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n - Fix retry race condition that can lead to double decrementing inFlightSubStreams and so miss calling closed (#11026) (bdb623031)\r\n - Change defaults to use the older PickFirstLoadBalancer and disable Happy Eyeballs.  This disables a performance optimization added in v1.63. (#11120) We have had a report that the new implementation can trigger a NullPointerException\r\n - core: Transition to CONNECTING immediately when exiting idle (2c5f0c22c). Previously the visible state change from `channel.getState()` was delayed until the name resolver returned results. This had no impact to RPC behavior\r\n - xds: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (e6305930d)\r\n - rls: Synchronization fixes in CachingRlsLbClient (6e97b180b). These races had not been witnessed in practice\r\n - rls: Guarantee backoff will update RLS picker (f9b6e5f92). This fixes a regression introduced by 6e97b180b that could hang RPCs instead of using fallback, but fixes a pre-existing bug that could greatly delay RPCs from using fallback.\r\n - rls: Fix time handling in CachingRlsLbClient (da619e2bd).

The new PickFirst implements subchannel picking logic.  (#11002) (8a9ce990b)\r\n* EDS resource now supports additional addresses (#11011) (38f968faf)\r\n* Change address based outlier detection to endpoint based (#10939) (c61fe6980)\r\n* Enable Happy Eyeballs by default (#11022) (51f811df8)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- rls: Adding extra debug logs (#10902) (eba699ad1)\r\n- binder: Add missing Android API annotations (#10841) (ce2adcca9)\r\n- core: Provide DEADLINE_EXCEEDED insights for context deadline (3abab95e7). When the deadline triggered and the deadline was set on the RPC via the stub or CallOptions, gRPC would gather additional debugging information to help understand where the RPC took so long. However if the deadline came from io.grpc.Context the error was simply “context timed out.” Now the debugging information is provided in both cases\r\n - examples: Fix file paths in debug example README (e19f1f15a)\r\n - compiler: implement ability to skip generation of javax annotation (#10927) (0d39c2c70). Pass the option `jakarta_omit` to protoc-gen-grpc-java when generating code\r\n- xds: Get rid of xDS v2 proto dependencies (#10968) (feab4e544). `grpc-xds` jar size has decreased by 35%.\r\n- xds: Support retrieving names from wrapped resource containers (#10975) (867e46940)\r\n - netty: improve server handling of writes to reset streams (#10258) (a68399a9b)\r\n-  api: Fix a typo in ServerInterceptor JavaDoc (#10990) (0b82f0126)\r\n- servlet: Check log fine level before hex string conversion. (#11038)\r\n- auth: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (1.63.x backport) #11050\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n - xds: Copy data in least request to avoid picker data race (f4cc166f1). This fixes a possible regression introduced in 1.60.0. Auditing the buggy code showed it unlikely to cause problems in practice, but that was more by happenstance than by design\r\n - xds: Fix data race in the xds client that contacts the control plane (d7628a3ab)\r\n - rls: Fix a local and remote race (aa9076812). The remote race could cause an RPC to hang until its deadline. It had been seen in practice when the client was severely CPU under-provisioned\r\n- xds: Fix xdsNameResolver virtual host lookup authority with xdstp style names. Use service authority instead of ldsResourceName (#10960) (78b3972ff)\r\n-  core: Fix retry race condition that can lead to double decrementing inFlightSubStreams and so miss calling closed (#11026) (#11033)\r\n- okhttp: Fix OkHTTP client transport leak (#11060)\r\n- xds: Use empty string when disabling server hostname verification ( #11058)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- Upgraded google-auth-library-java to 1.22.0\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\nAlex Panchenko \r\nBenjamin Peterson\r\nDavid Ankin\r\nPrashanth Swaminathan\r\nTouko Vainio-Kaila \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/143719637","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/143719637/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/143719637/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.62.2","id":143719637,"author":{"login":"larry-safran","id":107004254,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmDBXg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107004254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran","html_url":"https://github.com/larry-safran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larry-safran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4IkPzV","tag_name":"v1.62.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.62.2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-02-24T01:51:27Z","published_at":"2024-02-26T23:39:40Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.62.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.62.2","body":"## gRPC Java 1.62.2 Release Notes\r\nNote that this is the initial 1.62.x release\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n- services: Remove `io.grpc.services.BinaryLogs`, which was deprecated since 2021. `io.grpc.protobuf.services.BinaryLogs` should be used instead (#10832).\r\n- Allow users outside of io.grpc.xds package to create custom xDS resources (#10834) (6d96e6588)\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- api:Add ClientTransportFilter.  Similarly to ServerTransportFilter, this will provide an observability hook and it allows direct modification of the transport's attributes. (#10646)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n - java_grpc_library.bzl: Add support for Auto Exec Groups (cb03bd234). This is mostly a behind-the-scenes change to adjust to the newer way Bazel operates\r\n- java_grpc_library.bzl: Support runfiles for protoc and the plugin (65a6b3bc2). Neither binary uses runfiles, but the task will be ready if they need to in the future\r\n- xds: Add EC key support for XdsChannelCredentials/XdsServerCredentials (100d5a55f)\r\n- binder:Change log level from WARNING to FINER for expected exception during close with error, to reduce log spamming (#10899) (7ba0718bb)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n  - xds: Fix a bug in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer policy that could raise NullPointerException and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports TRANSIENT_FAILURE state. (#10868)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- The protoc plugin no longer supports macOS Big Sur (macOS 11). Binaries are now built using Monterey (macOS 12)\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n- @joybestourous\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/143719637/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.61.1","id":139731342,"author":{"login":"YifeiZhuang","id":4111145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTExNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4111145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/YifeiZhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4IVCGO","tag_name":"v1.61.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.61.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-02-02T17:57:19Z","published_at":"2024-02-02T21:33:45Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.61.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.61.1","body":"### Bug Fixes\r\nxds: Fix a bug in `WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer` policy that could raise `NullPointerException` and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel.

This makes its implementation more similar to `weighted_round_robin`.\r\n- xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (#10674). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (#10739). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.\r\n- util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (#10769)\r\n- util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81). The Gradle test fixtures are for use by grpc-java's internal tests.\r\n- okhttp: Ignore known conscrypt socket close issue (#10812). This stops an exception from being thrown when a known Conscrypt synchronization issue happens.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- Drop support for Bazel 5 (55a9c012c). Bazel 7 is available, and Protobuf has already dropped support for Bazel 5.\r\n- Change many compile deps to runtime deps (d6830d7f9). This reduces the transitive classes \"leaked\" into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (`io.grpc.internal`) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.\r\n- Upgrade dependencies (c985797d9)\r\n  - Protobuf to 3.25.1\r\n  - auto-value-annotations to 1.10.4\r\n  - error_prone_annotations to 2.23.0\r\n  - proto-google-common-protos to 2.29.0\r\n  - google-cloud-logging to 3.15.14\r\n  - guava to 32.1.3-android\r\n  - okio

API Changes\r\n* api: Stabilize `ForwardingServerBuilder`, `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`, and `ForwardingChannelBuilder`. Note that `ForwardingChannelBuilder` is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`. (#10586)\r\n* api: Deprecate `ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()`. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending `ForwardingChannelBuilder` implement the `delegate()` method. See javadoc for details (#10587)\r\n* api: Changed recently-introduced `LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()` to return `Status` instead of `boolean` (#10636). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization\r\n* stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (#10654)\r\n* alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends `ForwardingChannelBuilder2` (#10587)\r\n* protobuf: Stabilize `ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()` (#10628)\r\n* protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (#10627)\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n * core: `ManagedChannel`s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs\r\n * core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the `Status.UNKNOWN` returned to the client will have `Application error processing RPC` description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (#10643)\r\n * xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug\r\n * core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (#9314). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses\r\n * util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util\r\n * netty: Implement `Http2Headers.isEmpty()`. This fixes compatibility with Netty 4.1.101.Final.\r\n * netty: Add `NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()`. This can be used to limit impact of Rapid Reset\r\n * netty: Disable huffman coding in headers (#10563). Huffman coding provides modest compression for relatively high CPU usage, especially within a data center. Rely just on the HPACK static and dynamic tables for compression, for higher performance. This only impacts header values 512 bytes or longer, as Netty already disabled Huffman for smaller values\r\n * alts: Improve handshake failure error message by propagating original exception (#10644)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n * util: Remove shutdown subchannels from OD tracking (#10683). This could have caused a memory leak on a long-lived channel. But we don’t think it could be triggered with our built-in load balancing policies.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n * Bump Netty to 4.1.100.Final\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n@anthonyjpratti\r\n@fedorka\r\n@jpd236\r\n@mateusazis\r\n@pkoenig10\r\n@yannickepstein\r\n@amirhadadi","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/132721882/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":7},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/131768453","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/131768453/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/131768453/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.59.1","id":131768453,"author":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4H2qCF","tag_name":"v1.59.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.59.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-11-28T00:21:39Z","published_at":"2023-11-28T16:17:16Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.59.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.59.1","body":"* netty: Implement `Http2Headers.isEmpty()`.

At present, Netty always has higher priority than OkHttp, if they are both available, because `ServerBuilder.forPort()` is not supported in the OkHttp transport but is supported in the Netty transport\r\n* bazel: Enhance java_grpc_library.bzl to allow toolchain to use annotation processors\r\n* examples: Add pre-serialized-message example (#10112)\r\n* examples: Android examples to use AGP 7.4.0 (#10497)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* Fix compatibility with Java 8. This fixes the `NoSuchMethodError` for `ByteBuffer` methods present in 1.57.0 (#10441)\r\n* xds: Remove debug assert in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer. The assert was to detect breakages in the static stride algorithm causing too much looping. However, with multithreading it is possible to trigger even in legitimate scenarios (#10437)\r\n* util: Outlier detection tracer delegation (#10459)\r\n* Handle header with errors and endStream = true.  Was filling logs with NPEs.

The issue is tracked in https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10432 and fixed in 1.57.1.\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\n- Use fully qualified java.lang.String in all cases in generated code. This fixes compilation if a protobuf message is named “String”.\r\n- Stabilize io.grpc.Status.asRuntimeException(Metadata) and trailersFromThrowable\r\n- Stabilize io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder.useTransportSecurity (#10244)\r\n- Stabilize io.grpc.util.MutableHandlerRegistry (#10348)\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- api: CheckedForwardingClientCall now passes trailers from the caught exception\r\n- context, api: Package io.grpc is now consolidated into a single artifact grpc-api by moving classes from grpc-context to grpc-api. grpc-context now has a dependency on grpc-api (but excludes other dependencies of grpc-api) so any application previously using only grpc-context will now also bring in grpc-api. This fixes [#3522](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3522) which was the major issue preventing support of Java modules. We are not done fixing support, as some artifacts need to be split and Automatic-Module-Name needs to be added. The next release is likely to be more stable for modules.\r\n- core: Change delay for hedging retry after a non-fatal error to be 0 to match the gRFC ([A6](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md)).\r\n- core: Wrap other name resolver types in a RetryingNameResolver .  Previously, if authority was not overridden, then some name resolvers (such as grpclb) had no retry.\r\n- xds: Handle loops and duplicates in xds Aggregate clusters\r\n- xds: require EDS service name in CDS resources with an xdstp name\r\n- xds: Use Rule order instead of RuleChain\r\n- xds: Environment variable \"GRPC_XDS_EXPERIMENTAL_SECURITY_SUPPORT\" is no longer respected, so xDS security cannot be disabled any more (#10243)\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- binder: Add `UserHandle` and `BinderChannelCredentials` to support cross-user communication (#10197)\r\n- xds,orca: LRS named metrics support\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- core: Resolve isAndroid only once on class loading. This can improve channel creation performance on Android.\r\n- xds: Pick a subchannel with new static stride scheduler in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- xds: Fix the server sending a GOAWAY when an LDS update with no changes other than ordering is received.\r\n- netty: Fix NPE when a header with errors is received with endStream=true.  This was causing logs to be filled with errors when health checkers didn’t specify a content type.\r\n- okhttp: Fix the Socket data race when shutdown/closed during connecting that was causing a significant delay\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Netty to 4.1.93-Final\r\n- Update guava dependency to 32.0.1 to address CVE-2023-2976\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n- Benjamin Peterson\r\n- Masakuni Oishi\r\n- Philip K.

See [gRFC A62](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A62-pick-first.md#sticky-transient-failure). If it can't connect, pick-first will now immediately fail RPCs until after it successfully connects. RPCs will no longer be delayed while it performs those attempts, which previously could cause significant (error) latency. It now also performs reconnect attempts after failure and backoff without prompting; previously it required an RPC to trigger the reconnect. `ManagedChannel.idleTimeout` (defaults to 30 minutes) still applies and forces the channel idle after a period of no RPCs.\r\n- stub: Add a null check for `responseObserver` into the methods for initiating a call that takes a `responseObserver` argument. This ensures a fail fast with a clearer cause instead of an NPE when the observer is first used.\r\n- xds: Flip default for RLS being enabled to true for XDS (#10248) (#10252).  If there are no RLS configurations in your XDS or you already enabled it with the environment variable this will have no effect.  To disable it, set the flag `GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_RLS_LB` to false.\r\n- xds: Rename `weighted_round_robin_experimental` LB Policy to `weighted_round_robin` (#10162).\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- protobuf,protobuf-lite: Allow to configure protobuf recursion limit (#10094).\r\n- core: Optional address shuffle in `PickFirstLoadBalancer` (#10110).\r\n- xds: `pick_first` LB configuration (#10181).\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n- xds: Add `error-per-second` in weight formula for client-side WRR (#10177).\r\n- xds: Use` application_utilization` and fallback to `cpu_utilization` if unset in weight formula for client-side WRR. (#10256).\r\n- bazel: The README now mentions Bazel and where to find the example. (#10217).\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- binder: Handle unexpected exceptions on binder threads. (#10092.\r\n- ​​android,binder,cronet: `.aar` file when publishing. (#10138).\r\n- api: Fix boundary check in `Status.fromCodeValue()`. (#10155).\r\n- core: Don't use system Locale for content-type matching. (#10097).\r\n- okhttp: Fix signed-byte comparison in server when checking for ASCII in header (#10151). Without fix, authority could contain utf-8.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- Version pinning (e.g., `[1.56.0]` instead of `1.56.0`) has been removed from POMs, for both Netty and gRPC dependencies.

We track the two most recent major versions of Bazel, Bazel 5 and 6. Bazel 4 may still work, but we are no longer testing it\r\n* bazel: Include Tomcat annotations dependency for `@Generated` as used by autovalue (#9762). Necessary for building xds and rls on Java 9+\r\n* bazel: Export deps from Maven Central-specific stand-in targets (#9780). Some Maven Central artifacts are a combination of multiple Bazel targets, like grpc-core is composed of //core:inprocess, //core:internal, //core:util, //api. There is a “//core:core_maven” target used by maven_install that uses the other targets. Previously the target used `runtime_deps` to discourage their use by Bazel users, but that could cause compilation failures from lack of hjars.
