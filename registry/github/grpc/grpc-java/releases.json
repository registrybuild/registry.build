This omits `javax.annotation.Generated` from the generated code and makes the `org.apache.tomcat:annotations-api` compile-only dependency unnecessary (README and examples changes forthcoming; we delayed those changes until the release landed). You can use the option `@generated=javax` for the previous behavior, but please also file an issue so we can develop alternatives  \r\n* compiler: generate blocking v2 unary calls that throw StatusException (\\#12126) (a16d65591). Previously, the new blocking stub API was identical to the older blocking stub for unary RPCs and used the unchecked `StatusRuntimeException`. However, feedback demonstrated it was confusing to mix that with the checked `StatusException` in `BlockingClientCall`. Now the new blocking stub uses StatusException throughout. grpc-java continues to support the old generated code, but the version of protoc-gen-grpc-java will dictate which API you see. If you support multiple generated code versions, you can use the older blocking v1 stub for unary RPCs\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* netty: Fix a race that caused RPCs to hang on start when a GOAWAY was received while the RPCs’ headers were being written to the OS (b04c673fd, 15c757398). This was a very old race, not a recent regression. All streams should now properly fail instead of hanging, although in some cases they may be transparently retried  \r\n* util: OutlierDetection should use nanoTime, not currentTimeMillis (\\#12110) (1c4309899). Previously, changes in the wall time would impact its accounting  \r\n* xds: Don't allow hostnames in address field in EDS (\\#12123) (482dc5c1c). Only IP addresses were handled properly, and only IP addresses should be handled per gRFC A27  \r\n* xds: In resource handling, call onError() for RDS and EDS NACKs (\\#12122) (efe9ccc22). Previously the resource was NACKed, but gRPC would continue waiting for the resource until a timeout was reached and claim the control plane didn’t send the resource. Now it will fail quickly with an informative error  \r\n* xds: Implement equals in RingHashConfig (a5eaa66cc). Previously all configuration refreshes were considered a new config, which had the potential for causing unexpected inefficiency problems. This was noticed by new code for gRFC A74 xDS Config Tears that is not yet enabled, so there are no known problems that this caused  \r\n* LBs should avoid calling LBs after lb.shutdown() (1df2a3305). This fixed pick\\_first and ring\\_hash behavior that could cause rare and “random” races in parent load balancers like a `NullPointerException` in `ClusterImplLoadBalancer.createSubchannel()`, which had a ring\\_hash child. This is most likely to help xDS, as it heavily uses hierarchical LB policies\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* util: Deliver addresses in a random order to shuffle connection creation ordering (f07eb47ca). Previously, connections were created in-order (but non-blocking), so in a fast network the first address could be more likely to connect first given a \"microsecond\" headstart. That first connection then receives all the buffered RPCs, which could cause temporary, but repeated, load imbalances of the same backend when all clients receive the same list of addresses in the same order. This has been seen in practice, but it is unclear how often it happens. Shuffling has the potential to improve load distribution of new clients when using round\\_robin, weighted\\_round\\_robin, and least\\_request, which connect simultaneously to multiple addresses\r\n* core: Use lazy message formatting in checkState (\\#12144) (26bd0eee4). This avoids the potential of unnecessarily formatting an exception as a string when a subchannel fails to connect  \r\n* bazel: Migrate java\\_grpc\\_library to use DefaultInfo (\\#12148) (6f69363d9). This adds compatibility for `--incompatible_disable_target_default_provider_fields`  \r\n* binder: Rationalize @ThreadSafe-ty inside BinderTransport (\\#12130) (c20642874)  \r\n* binder: Cancel checkAuthorization() request if still pending upon termination (\\#12167) (30d40a617)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* compiler: Upgrade Protobuf C++ to 22.5 (\\#11961) (46485c8b6). This is used by the pre-built protoc-gen-grpc-java plugin on Maven Central. This should have no visible benefit, but gets us closer to upgrading to Protobuf 27 which added edition 2023 support  \r\n* release: Migrate artifacts publishing changed from legacy OSSRH to Central Portal (\\#12156) (f99b2aaef). We aren’t aware of any visible changes to the results on Maven Central","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/235779952/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/222619181","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/222619181/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/222619181/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.73.0","id":222619181,"author":{"login":"shivaspeaks","id":56782215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzgyMjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56782215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks","html_url":"https://github.com/shivaspeaks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaspeaks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4NROYt","tag_name":"v1.73.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"V1.73.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-05-27T04:54:39Z","published_at":"2025-06-03T06:18:02Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.73.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.73.0","body":"## API Changes\r\nxds: Enable least request by default (#12062)\r\ncore: Delete the long-deprecated GRPC_PROXY_EXP env variable (#11988) (908f9f19c).

For example, if changing a route from one backend service to another, RPCs may see less latency during the transition\r\n- core: Log any exception during channel panic because of exception (3961a923a). This prevents the exception from propagating up the stack on an arbitrary thread. Such exceptions are rarely interesting. Instead, the exception that caused the channel panic is the important one, and RPCs will still fail with its details\r\n- util: Graceful switch to new LB when leaving CONNECTING (2e260a4bb). Previously when using xDS and the configuration changes the LB policy, the old LB policy is used until the new one is READY. Now the old LB policy is used until the new policy becomes READY, TRANSIENT_FAILURE, or IDLE\r\n- core: Use java.time.Time.getNano directly in InstantTimeProvider. Previously reflection was used which would confuse R8 full mode (#11977) (7507a9ec0)\r\n- core: Avoid cancellation exceptions when notifying watchers that already have their connections cancelled (#11934) (350f90e1a)\r\n- rls: allow maxAge in RLS config to exceed 5 minutes if staleAge is set.

Overriding transport authority at rpc time is only allowed when using TlsChannelCredentials. The per-rpc authority verification feature is guarded by the environment variable GRPC_ENABLE_PER_RPC_AUTHORITY_CHECK in this release. When this is false or not set, the rpc will not fail when the authority verification fails but a warning will be logged. In a subsequent release the usage of this environment variable will be removed and RPCs will start failing if the authority doesn't match the peer certificate names.

This fixes a regression introduced in 1.64.0. The regression should have caused failures on API level 23 and earlier when a StatusRuntimeException or StatusException was created. However, for unknown reasons tests on old devices didn’t notice issues  \r\n* okhttp: Improve certificate handling by rejecting non-ASCII subject alternative names and hostnames as seen in CVE-2021-0341 (\\#11749) (a0982ca0a). Hostnames are considered trusted and CAs are required to use punycode for non-ASCII hostnames, so this is expected to provide defense-in-depth.

This (along with 6c12c2bd2) fixes a nonce-handling regression introduced in 1.66.0 that could cause resources to appear to not exist until re-creating the ADS stream. Triggering the behavior required specific config changes. It is easiest to trigger when clusters use EDS and routes are changed from one cluster to another. The error “found 0 leaf (logical DNS or EDS) clusters for root cluster” might then be seen  \r\n* xds: Remember nonces for unknown types (6c12c2bd2)  \r\n* xds: Unexpected types in the bootstrap’s server\\_features should be ignored (e8ff6da2c). They were previously required to be strings  \r\n* xds: Remove xds authority label from metric registration (\\#11760) (6516c7387). This fixes the error “Incorrect number of required labels provided. Expected: 4” introduced in 1.69.0  \r\n* xds: Fixed unsupported unsigned 32 bits issue for circuit breaker (\\#11735) (f8f613984). This fixes clients treating large max\\_requests as “no requests” and failing all requests\r\n\r\n## **Improvements**\r\n\r\n* api: Introduce custom NameResolver.Args (\\#11669) (0b2d44098)  \r\n* stub: Introduce new API:  BlockingStubV2 which supports Bidi streaming, Client streaming, a cleaner Server streaming and Unary RPCs (\\#10318) (ea8c31c30)  \r\n* bazel: Remove workaround for DoNotCall fixed in Bazel 3.4 (805cad378)  \r\n* binder: A standard API for pointing resolvers at a different Android User. (\\#11775) (1126a8e30)  \r\n* xds: Fix XDS control plane client retry timer backoff duration when connection closes after results are received (\\#11766) (ef7c2d59c)  \r\n* xds: Parsing xDS Cluster Metadata (\\#11741) (1edc4d84d). Not used actively, but this adds validation. The validation is unlikely to fail but may reject invalid resources.  \r\n* xds: Use \"\\#server\" as dataplane target value for xDS enabled gRPC servers (\\#11715) (ebb43a69e). This only impacts the `grpc.target` label in `grpc.xds_client.*` metrics. Previously the empty string was used  \r\n* rls: Reduce RLS debug channel logging (7f9c1f39f). This only matters when debug logging is enabled\r\n\r\n## **Documentation**\r\n\r\n* examples: Simplify graceful shutdown in Hostname example (f1109e421)  \r\n* examples: Remove references to maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com (c96e926e6)  \r\n* examples: Updated the attachHeaders to newAttachHeadersInterceptor in HeaderClientInterceptor (\\#11759) (5e8abc677)\r\n\r\n## **Dependencies**\r\n\r\n* Bazel 8 is released, so replace Bazel 6 testing with Bazel 7 (8a5f7776d)\r\n\r\n## **Thanks to**\r\n\r\n* [@panchenko](https://github.com/panchenko)  \r\n* [@benjaminp](https://github.com/benjaminp)  \r\n* [@ZachChuba](https://github.com/ZachChuba)  \r\n* [@vinodhabib](https://github.com/vinodhabib)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/196574789/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/195400017","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/195400017/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/195400017/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.69.1","id":195400017,"author":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4LpZFR","tag_name":"v1.69.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.69.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-01-16T15:29:51Z","published_at":"2025-01-17T20:03:31Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.69.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.69.1","body":"## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * okhttp: Improve certificate handling by rejecting non-ASCII subject alternative names and hostnames as seen in CVE-2021-0341 (\\#11749) (a0982ca0a).

This is the first release of version 1.68.x\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* xds: Fix NullPointerException introduced in \"Fix load reporting when pick first is used for locality-routing\" (\\#11553). This fix was in 1.67.1 but not 1.68.0\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n* core: JSON parsing rejects duplicate keys in objects (\\#11575) (4be69e3f8). This is the existing behavior in C core. Duplicate keys in objects are dangerous as which value takes effect is undefined. Previously, the last value was used  \r\n* okhttp: Detect transport executors with no remaining threads (\\#11503) (3a6be9ca1). The transport uses two threads, but one is on-demand. If the executor provided to `builder.transportExecutor()` runs out of threads (e.g., it is a fixed-size thread pool), *all* transports can be wedged, unable to run on-demand tasks, until keepalive kills one of them. Two threads are now used when handshaking a new transport, and the transport will time out after 1 second with “Timed out waiting for second handshake thread” if two threads are unavailable  \r\n* gcp-csm-o11y: Get  `mesh_id` value from `CSM_MESH_ID` environment variable, instead of getting it from bootstrap file (84d30afad)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* New grpc-context-override-opentelemetry artifact (\\#11523) (782a44ad6) (\\#11599) (e59ae5fad). This is a `io.grpc.Context` storage override to store its state in `io.opentelemetry.context.Context`. Libraries should not add a dependency on this artifact, as applications can only have one storage override in their classpath  \r\n* New grpc-s2a artifact. It is a transport that offloads the handshake similar to ALTS, but for TLS. It provides `io.grpc.s2a.S2AChannelCredentials`  \r\n* api: Enhance name resolver \\`ResolutionResult\\` to hold addresses or error so the single listener API *onResult2* is used to convey both success and error cases for name resolution (\\#11330) (1ded8aff8)  \r\n* core: Handle NameResolver/LoadBalancer exceptions when panicking (b692b9d26). This expands the class of bugs that will fail RPCs with the panic error, versus some undefined behavior  \r\n* core: Use the default service config in case of initial name resolver address resolution error (\\#11577) (fa26a8bc5)  \r\n* core: `StreamTracer.inboundMessageRead()` now reports uncompressed message size when the message does not need compression (\\#11598) (2aae68e11). Previously it always reported `-1` (unknown)  \r\n* netty: Avoid TCP\\_USER\\_TIMEOUT warning when explicitly specifying a non-epoll channel type to use (\\#11564) (62f409810)  \r\n* okhttp: Don't warn about missing Conscrypt (6f3542297). This is especially helpful when using TLS but not running on Android  \r\n* android: For `UdsChannelBuilder`, use fake IP instead of localhost (a908b5e40).

There was a problem making the release and it went to Maven Central as 1.68.0 instead. This is a version-corrected release.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Petiole load balancing policies (e.g., round\\_robin, weighted\\_round\\_robin, ring\\_hash, least\\_request) had internal refactorings. This should not have changed their behavior  \r\n* api: Introduce onResult2 in NameResolver Listener2 that returns Status (90d0fabb1)\r\n* core: touch() buffer when detach()ing (e821d5e15). This makes it clearer whether a leak is a gRPC leak or an application leak when the Detachable API is being used  \r\n* example: delete duplicate and unused code in KeepAliveClient.java (6a9bc3ba1)  \r\n* example: Added Dualstack example (\\#11451) (72a977bf7)  \r\n* stub: Add newAttachMetadataServerInterceptor() MetadataUtil (\\#11458) (6dbd1b9d5)\r\n* xds: Separate xds clients for each channel target, each with its own connection to an xds server. (\\#11484) (d034a56cb)  \r\n* xds: Envoy proto sync to 2024-07-06 (\\#11401) (96a788a34)  \r\n* xds: cncf/xds proto sync to 2024-07-24 (\\#11417) (0017c98f6)  \r\n* xds: Import RLQS protos (\\#11418) (c29763d88)  \r\n* xds: ClusterManagerLB must update child configuration (10d6002cb). Previously, RLS configuration would not have been updated  \r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* core: Revert \"Enable new PickFirst LB (\\#11348)\" (\\#11425) (cc1cbe987)  \r\n* rls: Fix log statements incorrectly referring to \"LRS\" (\\#11497) (c63e35488)\r\n* util: Stop using SocketAddress.toString() for checking address equality (f866c805c). This change applies to all petiole load balancing policies. For regular usages that use dns name resolution, this is unlikely to matter as the default dns name resolver returns consistent addresses. But this might improve LB behavior for some custom load balancers  \r\n* xds: Fix load reporting when pick first is used for locality-routing. (\\#11495) (1dae144f0)  \r\n* xds: Fix NullPointerException introduced in \"Fix load reporting when pick first is used for locality-routing\" (#11553). This change is not present in 1.68.0\r\n* xds: XdsClient should unsubscribe on last resource (\\#11264) (448ec4f37)  \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Upgrade Netty to 4.1.110 and tcnative to 2.0.65 (\\#11444) (70ae83288)  \r\n* examples: Upgrade Maven plugin versions (75012a5be)  \r\n* Remove direct dependency on j2objc (ff8e41376)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@Juneezee\r\n@lujiajing1126\r\n@JarvisCraft\r\n@sunpe\r\n","mentions_count":4},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/177685833","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/177685833/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/177685833/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.68.0","id":177685833,"author":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4Kl0VJ","tag_name":"v1.68.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.68.0 MISTAKE","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-09-17T09:11:26Z","published_at":"2024-09-30T21:17:08Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.68.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.68.0","body":"This was supposed to be v1.67.0, but there was a mistake during the release process.

(#11320) (25a8b7c50)\r\n * util: Stabilize `AdvancedTlsX509TrustManager`, an `X509ExtendedTrustManager` that allows users to configure advanced TLS features, such as root certificate reloading and peer cert custom verification. (658cbf6cf)\r\n * util: Align AdvancedTlsX509{Key and Trust}Manager. (#11385)\r\n * util: Add `GracefulSwitchLoadBalancer` config (ebed04798) and mark switchTo() deprecated. (85e0a01ec). `GracefulSwitchLoadBalancer` now receives its configuration like a regular load balancer.\r\n * binder: Introduce `AllowSecurityPolicy` to allow calling code to not have to wait on async/slow implementations. `BinderTransport` now submits async implementations to an executor. (#11272) (7fee6a3fe)\r\n * api: Add convenience method in `ServerBuilder` for adding a list of service implementations to the handler registry together. (#11285) (85ed05300)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * examples: Improve example Bazel WORKSPACE to demonstrate referencing grpc-xds. (5ec0187e2)\r\n * examples: Include Bazel bzlmod configuration (36e687f9d). There are now examples for both non-bzlmod and bzlmod.\r\n * core: Fixes to `PickFirstLeafLoadBalancer`\r\n   * Eliminate NPE after recovering from a temporary name resolution failure. (#11298)\r\n   * Deduplicate addresses. (#11342, #11345)\r\n * core: Change default to use the new pick first load balancer (PickFirstLeafLoadBalancer). (#11348)\r\n * core: Use retryThrottling from defaultServiceConfig when the name resolver config doesn't provide this config. (#11274) (062ebb4d7)\r\n * netty: Enable use of Netty 4.1.111 by avoiding the optimization provided by `NettyAdaptiveCumulator` if Netty is on version 4.1.111 or later. (#11367)\r\n * binder: Set a default connect timeout of 60 seconds. (#11359) (21dec3092)\r\n * binder: Make `BinderServer` own `ServerAuthInterceptor`'s executor that helps avoid leaks. (#11293) (15ad9f546)\r\n * services:: Added `ProtoReflectionServiceV1` for the v1 reflection protocol. The preexisting `ProtoReflectionService` implements the v1alpha reflection protocol. (#11237) (0aa976c4e)\r\n \r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* binder: Add missing synchronization to prevent races when calling awaitTermination(). (#11277) (14fd81f59) \r\n* util: Fix `AdvancedTlsX509TrustManager` validation on servers when using SSLSocket. Previously it would try to use a null SSLEngine . (dcb1c018c)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n * compiler: Upgrade from CentOS 7 to AlmaLinux 8 for the pre-compiled Linux protoc-gen-grpc-java (71eb5fb9f). This adds a runtime dependency on libstdc++\r\n * Upgrade animal-sniffer-annotations to 1.24 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade error_prone_annotations to 2.28.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade proto-google-common-protos to 2.41.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade google-auth-library to 1.23.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade gson to 2.11.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade guava to 33.2.1 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade opentelemetry to 1.40.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade perfmark-api to 0.27.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade protobuf-java to 3.25.3 (a97738518)\r\n * xds: Remove unused opencensus-proto dependency (e7c3803b5)\r\n * bazel: Replace `@com_github_cncf_udpa` usage with preexisting `@com_github_cncf_xds`; delete `@com_github_cncf_udpa` repo alias for xds (6dd6ca9f9)\r\n * bazel: Upgrade envoyproxy/data-plane-api to 1611a730 (c540993aa). The version used by Gradle had been updated in 1.62.0 (68334a01), but the bazel version had not\r\n * bazel: Use com_google_protobuf instead of com_google_protobuf_javalite (7a25e6895). Bazel’s protobuf rules no longer use the old com_google_protobuf_javalite repository name\r\n * bazel: Don't require protobuf to be in maven_install (d3c2f5a2d). Protobuf’s targets are generally just used directly; this fixed the only place that used maven’s `artifact()` syntax\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n\r\n@hlx502

in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n * New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * api: Add `ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)` (960012d76). This is the same as the existing `inboundHeaders()`, but is provided the Metadata\r\n * api: Fix various typos in the documentation (#11144) (6ec744f2a)\r\n * core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code\r\n * util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (#11139) (781b4c457) This change shows `@ExperimentalApi` being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release\r\n * examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (#11131) (c31dbf48a)\r\n * binder: Add a connection timeout (#11255) (791f894e2)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n * core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible\r\n * netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (#11294) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption\r\n * okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19). Previously, shutting down when a new connection was being established could result in the server never becoming terminated\r\n * inprocess: Fix listener race if transport is shutdown while starting (e4e7f3a06). This issue was unlikely to be hit outside of specialized tests\r\n * services: restore //services:binarylog bazel target (#11292) (d57f271). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.62.2\r\n * binder: Wait for all server transports to terminate before returning the security policy executor to the object pool (#11240) (34ee600dc)\r\n * binder: Reject further SETUP_TRANSPORT requests post-BinderServer shutdown (#11260) (1670e97f7)\r\n * bazel: Include missing com_google_protobuf_javalite in MODULE.bazel (#11147) (f995c121e)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@hakusai22\r\n@firov\r\n@mateusazis\r\n@Mir3605\r\n@niloc132\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/163040246/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":5},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/156308705/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.63.1","id":156308705,"author":{"login":"sergiitk","id":672669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjY2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/672669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk","html_url":"https://github.com/sergiitk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiitk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4JURTh","tag_name":"v1.63.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-05-16T20:53:38Z","published_at":"2024-05-17T17:15:26Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.63.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.63.1","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n - netty: Release SendGrpcFrameCommand when stream is missing (#11116) (fb9a10809)\r\n - Change defaults to use the older PickFirstLoadBalancer and disable Happy Eyeballs.

For Netty 4.1.111 compatibility, it is best to use 1.63.2, 1.64.2, 1.65.1, and later. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11284 ._\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n - compiler: the option `jakarta_omit` was renamed `@generated=omit` (#11086) (8a21afcc9)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n - New API LoadBalancer.getChannelTarget() (4561bb5b8)\r\n - opentelemetry: Publish new module grpc-opentelemetry (5ba1a5563). The feature is still missing documentation and an example. It only supports metrics; tracing and logs will be future enhancements. See [gRFC A66](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A66-otel-stats.md)\r\n - bazel: Add support for bzlmod (#11046) (d1890c0ac)\r\n - bazel: Replace usages of the old compatibility maven targets with `@maven` targets (00649913b)\r\n - okhttp: Support serverBuilder.maxConcurrentCallsPerConnection (Fixes #11062). (#11063) (805072339)\r\n - xds: Experimental metrics recording in WRR LB (06df25b65, 35a171bc1, 2897b3939), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry. See [gRFC A78](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A78-grpc-metrics-wrr-pf-xds.md)\r\n - rls: Experimental metrics recording in RLS LB (a9fb272b7, a1d19327f, 813331837), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n - examples: support bazel build for retry policy example (58de563fa)\r\n - netty: Allow deframer errors to close stream with a status code, as long as headers have not yet been sent (e036b1b19). This will greatly improve the debuggability of certain server errors in particular cases. Instead of the client seeing “CANCELLED: RST_STREAM closed stream. HTTP/2 error code: CANCEL”, they could see “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size 4194304: 6144592”\r\n - netty: Improve handling of unexpected write queue promise failures (#11016)\r\n - servlet: Avoid unnecessary FINEST hex string conversion by checking log level. Fixes #11031.

This disables a performance optimization added in v1.63. (#11120) We have had a report that the new implementation can trigger a NullPointerException\r\n - core: Transition to CONNECTING immediately when exiting idle (2c5f0c22c). Previously the visible state change from `channel.getState()` was delayed until the name resolver returned results. This had no impact to RPC behavior\r\n - xds: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (e6305930d)\r\n - rls: Synchronization fixes in CachingRlsLbClient (6e97b180b). These races had not been witnessed in practice\r\n - rls: Guarantee backoff will update RLS picker (f9b6e5f92). This fixes a regression introduced by 6e97b180b that could hang RPCs instead of using fallback, but fixes a pre-existing bug that could greatly delay RPCs from using fallback.\r\n - rls: Fix time handling in CachingRlsLbClient (da619e2bd). This could have caused backoff entries to improperly be considered expired\r\n - xds: Properly disable the default endpoint identification algorithm with XdsChannelCredentials (097a46b76). The credential does its own verification and the default needs to be disabled for SPIFFE\r\n - netty: Release SendGrpcFrameCommand when stream is missing (#11116) (fb9a10809)\r\n - okhttp: Remove finished stream even if a pending stream was started (d21fe32be)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n - cronet: Update Cronet to latest release + Move to Stable Cronet APIs.

The new PickFirst implements subchannel picking logic.  (#11002) (8a9ce990b)\r\n* EDS resource now supports additional addresses (#11011) (38f968faf)\r\n* Change address based outlier detection to endpoint based (#10939) (c61fe6980)\r\n* Enable Happy Eyeballs by default (#11022) (51f811df8)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- rls: Adding extra debug logs (#10902) (eba699ad1)\r\n- binder: Add missing Android API annotations (#10841) (ce2adcca9)\r\n- core: Provide DEADLINE_EXCEEDED insights for context deadline (3abab95e7). When the deadline triggered and the deadline was set on the RPC via the stub or CallOptions, gRPC would gather additional debugging information to help understand where the RPC took so long. However if the deadline came from io.grpc.Context the error was simply “context timed out.” Now the debugging information is provided in both cases\r\n - examples: Fix file paths in debug example README (e19f1f15a)\r\n - compiler: implement ability to skip generation of javax annotation (#10927) (0d39c2c70). Pass the option `jakarta_omit` to protoc-gen-grpc-java when generating code\r\n- xds: Get rid of xDS v2 proto dependencies (#10968) (feab4e544). `grpc-xds` jar size has decreased by 35%.\r\n- xds: Support retrieving names from wrapped resource containers (#10975) (867e46940)\r\n - netty: improve server handling of writes to reset streams (#10258) (a68399a9b)\r\n-  api: Fix a typo in ServerInterceptor JavaDoc (#10990) (0b82f0126)\r\n- servlet: Check log fine level before hex string conversion. (#11038)\r\n- auth: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (1.63.x backport) #11050\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n - xds: Copy data in least request to avoid picker data race (f4cc166f1). This fixes a possible regression introduced in 1.60.0. Auditing the buggy code showed it unlikely to cause problems in practice, but that was more by happenstance than by design\r\n - xds: Fix data race in the xds client that contacts the control plane (d7628a3ab)\r\n - rls: Fix a local and remote race (aa9076812).

Similarly to ServerTransportFilter, this will provide an observability hook and it allows direct modification of the transport's attributes. (#10646)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n - java_grpc_library.bzl: Add support for Auto Exec Groups (cb03bd234). This is mostly a behind-the-scenes change to adjust to the newer way Bazel operates\r\n- java_grpc_library.bzl: Support runfiles for protoc and the plugin (65a6b3bc2). Neither binary uses runfiles, but the task will be ready if they need to in the future\r\n- xds: Add EC key support for XdsChannelCredentials/XdsServerCredentials (100d5a55f)\r\n- binder:Change log level from WARNING to FINER for expected exception during close with error, to reduce log spamming (#10899) (7ba0718bb)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n  - xds: Fix a bug in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer policy that could raise NullPointerException and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports TRANSIENT_FAILURE state. (#10868)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- The protoc plugin no longer supports macOS Big Sur (macOS 11). Binaries are now built using Monterey (macOS 12)\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n- @joybestourous\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/143719637/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/139731342/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.61.1","id":139731342,"author":{"login":"YifeiZhuang","id":4111145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTExNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4111145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/YifeiZhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YifeiZhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4IVCGO","tag_name":"v1.61.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.61.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-02-02T17:57:19Z","published_at":"2024-02-02T21:33:45Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.61.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.61.1","body":"### Bug Fixes\r\nxds: Fix a bug in `WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer` policy that could raise `NullPointerException` and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel.

This makes its implementation more similar to `weighted_round_robin`.\r\n- xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (#10674). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (#10739). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.\r\n- util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (#10769)\r\n- util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81). The Gradle test fixtures are for use by grpc-java's internal tests.\r\n- okhttp: Ignore known conscrypt socket close issue (#10812). This stops an exception from being thrown when a known Conscrypt synchronization issue happens.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- Drop support for Bazel 5 (55a9c012c). Bazel 7 is available, and Protobuf has already dropped support for Bazel 5.\r\n- Change many compile deps to runtime deps (d6830d7f9). This reduces the transitive classes \"leaked\" into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (`io.grpc.internal`) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.\r\n- Upgrade dependencies (c985797d9)\r\n  - Protobuf to 3.25.1\r\n  - auto-value-annotations to 1.10.4\r\n  - error_prone_annotations to 2.23.0\r\n  - proto-google-common-protos to 2.29.0\r\n  - google-cloud-logging to 3.15.14\r\n  - guava to 32.1.3-android\r\n  - okio

API Changes\r\n* api: Stabilize `ForwardingServerBuilder`, `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`, and `ForwardingChannelBuilder`. Note that `ForwardingChannelBuilder` is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`. (#10586)\r\n* api: Deprecate `ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()`. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending `ForwardingChannelBuilder` implement the `delegate()` method. See javadoc for details (#10587)\r\n* api: Changed recently-introduced `LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()` to return `Status` instead of `boolean` (#10636). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization\r\n* stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (#10654)\r\n* alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends `ForwardingChannelBuilder2` (#10587)\r\n* protobuf: Stabilize `ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()` (#10628)\r\n* protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (#10627)\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n * core: `ManagedChannel`s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs\r\n * core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the `Status.UNKNOWN` returned to the client will have `Application error processing RPC` description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (#10643)\r\n * xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug\r\n * core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (#9314). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses\r\n * util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util\r\n * netty: Implement `Http2Headers.isEmpty()`. This fixes compatibility with Netty 4.1.101.Final.\r\n * netty: Add `NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()`. This can be used to limit impact of Rapid Reset\r\n * netty: Disable huffman coding in headers (#10563). Huffman coding provides modest compression for relatively high CPU usage, especially within a data center. Rely just on the HPACK static and dynamic tables for compression, for higher performance.

This is ABI-breaking, see the warning above. (#10406)\r\n* core: Removed .class file hack previously introduced in [`v1.36.0`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.36.0) to ease removal of internal ABIs. (#10406)\r\n* api: Add `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`, an ABI-safe version of `ForwardingChannelBuilder`, which will be deprecated in the following release. (#10585, #10406)\r\n* api: Add `LoadBalancer.FixedResultPicker` convenience class for load balancer implementations. It is a replacement for `ErrorPicker` and `EMPTY_PICKER` added in 1.58.0\r\n* testing: Stabilize TestMethodDescriptors (#10530)\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n* core: de-expermentalize pick first config parsing (#10531)\r\n* netty: Respect -Dio.netty.allocator.type=unpooled when getting Netty Allocator instead of ignoring it (#10543)\r\n* netty: Use UNAVAILABLE for connections closed while writing. Previously this would result in UNKNOWN\r\n* binder: Enable indirect addressing using <intent-filter>s. (#10550)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* core: only use reflection to resolve InternalCensusStatsAccessor once instead of once per channel\r\n* core: enhance error message in the case of DEADLINE_EXCEEDED to indicate name resolution delay.\r\n* netty: When creating a connection, use java.util.logging formatting instead of String.format to avoid work when not logged\r\n* netty: Touch ByteBuf when message framing has been decoded. If the buffer is leaked, this helps narrow down the source of reference counting bug\r\n* java_grpc_library.bzl: Disable Automatic Exec Groups inside grpc libraries (#10514). This improves compatibility with future Bazel versions while retaining Bazel 5.x compatibility\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* netty: Avoid NettyAdaptiveCumulator incorrectly releasing its input ByteBuf twice when reading messages under certain error conditions (#10537)\r\n* xds: Add fix for xdstp replacement for percent-encoded authorities (#10571)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* API documentation (Javadoc) for Server and Channel builders now correctly displays inherited methods and the class hierarchy. (#10406)\r\n* examples: add an example for OAuth (#10560)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n* Upgrade Netty to 4.1.97.Final\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nJohn Cormie (@jdcormie)\r\nStephane Landelle (@slandelle)\r\n@kotlaja\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/126051439/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":3}]
