This change should resolve some unnecessary reconnections introduced in v1.75.0 when using weighted_round_robin and maybe other policies.\r\n- **netty:** Remove Netty version detection since grpc-netty-shaded can't reliably determine its Netty version when multiple copies of Netty are present (even when shaded). This fixes the resurfacing of the Netty 4.1.111 corruption fixed in 1.65.0. That version fixed grpc-netty, but v1.75.0 upgraded grpc-netty-shaded to Netty 4.1.111 and exposed the Netty version detection problem. This fixes corruption, so the error messages range wildly, but one of them is \"RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size\"\r\n- **compiler:** A fix has been implemented for the blockingV2 stub to mangle generated method names that conflict with java.lang.Object methods.\r\n- **servlet:** A race condition in AsyncServletOutputStreamWriter has been fixed to prevent threads from getting stuck.\r\n- **servlet:** An issue where AsyncContext.complete() was called multiple times, causing an IllegalStateException, has been resolved.\r\n- **binder:** The REMOTE_UID is now required to hold the exact UID passed to the SecurityPolicy.\r\n- **binder:** The server will now only accept post-setup transactions from the authorized server UID.\r\n- **util:** AdvancedTlsX509TrustManager now errors with a message to say that files don’t exist instead of the previous “Files were unmodified before their initial update. Probably a bug.”\r\n- **android:** A fix has been implemented for network change handling on API levels below 24.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- **api:** Allocations of Attributes.Builder have been reduced. This mostly benefits attributes.toBuilder(), but that’s not expected to be visible in regular workloads.\r\n- **api:** An empty array allocation in LoadBalancer.CreateSubchannelArgs.Builder has been avoided. It is a small optimization and is not expected to have any performance impact.\r\n- **servlet:** A configurable methodNameResolver has been added to configure the mapping from servlet request paths to gRPC method name\r\n- **servlet:** Avoid a race by increasing the AsyncContext timeout by 5 seconds. The gRPC Context timeout should trigger first\r\n- **xds:** Pretty-print envoy.service.discovery.v3.Resource in debug logs\r\n- **bazel:** The java/proto rules from rules_java/rules_proto are now used instead of native rules.\r\n- **bazel:** Unnecessary direct build dependencies were removed from some targets\r\n- **netty:** Support for the BCJSSE provider has been added in GrpcSslContexts.\r\n- **netty:** Huffman coding in server response headers has been disabled; it was already disabled for client request headers\r\n- **netty:** Include allow header for HTTP response code 405\r\n- **okhttp:** Include allow header for HTTP response code 405\r\n- **binder:** Error descriptions for ServiceConnection callbacks have been improved\r\n- **binder:** Apps can now call SecurityPolicy.checkAuthorization() by PeerUid.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- **stub:** Trailers are now propagated in StatusException when thrown by BlockingClientCall.\r\n- **compiler:** Support for macOS aarch64 with a universal binary has been added.\r\n- **opentelemetry:** grpc.subchannel.* metrics as described in [gRFC A94 OTel metrics for Subchannels](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A94-subchannel-otel-metrics.md) have been added. grpc.disconnect_error will show as “unknown” until transports implement support\r\n- **binder:** A NameResolver for Android's intent: URIs has been introduced.\r\n- **binder:** A basic SocketStats with just the local and remote addresses has been added for channelz.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- **SECURITY.md:** The documentation now describes how to use gcompat with LD_PRELOAD for Alpine.\r\n- **examples:** The documentation now explains Bazel BCR releases and the git_override option.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Guava version to 33.4.8.\r\n- The org.apache.tomcat:annotations-api dependency has been removed from the examples.\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n\r\n@[JoeCqupt](https://github.com/JoeCqupt)\r\n@[Sangamesh1997](https://github.com/Sangamesh1997)\r\n@[benjaminp](https://github.com/benjaminp)\r\n@[camelcc](https://github.com/camelcc)\r\n@[dmytroreutov](https://github.com/dmytroreutov)\r\n@[duckladydinh](https://github.com/duckladydinh)\r\n@[jirkafm](https://github.com/jirkafm)\r\n@[kilink](https://github.com/kilink)\r\n@[panchenko](https://github.com/panchenko)\r\n@[umairk79](https://github.com/umairk79)\r\n@[vimanikag](https://github.com/vimanikag)\r\n@[werkt](https://github.com/werkt)\r\n@[xuhongxu96](https://github.com/xuhongxu96)\r\n@[zrlw](https://github.com/zrlw)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/253215884/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/241509460","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/241509460/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/241509460/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.75.0","id":241509460,"author":{"login":"kannanjgithub","id":29600796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjAwNzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29600796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub","html_url":"https://github.com/kannanjgithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4OZSRU","tag_name":"v1.75.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.75.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-08-20T11:56:32Z","updated_at":"2025-10-08T17:50:04Z","published_at":"2025-08-21T13:15:05Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.75.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.75.0","body":"### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n* binder: Introduce server pre-authorization (#12127). grpc-binder clients authorize servers by checking the UID of the sender of the SETUP_TRANSPORT Binder transaction against some SecurityPolicy. But merely binding to an unauthorized server to learn its UID can enable \"keep-alive\" and \"background activity launch\" abuse, even if security policy ultimately causes the grpc connection to fail. Pre-authorization mitigates this kind of abuse by resolving addresses and authorizing a candidate server Application's UID before binding to it. Pre-auth is especially important when the server's address is not fixed in advance but discovered by PackageManager lookup.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* core: `grpc-timeout` should always be positive (#12201) (6dfa03c51). There is a local race between when the deadline is checked before sending the RPC and when the timeout is calculated to put on-the-wire. The code replaced negative timeouts with 0 nanoseconds. gRPC’s PROTOCOL-HTTP2 spec states that timeouts should be positive, so now non-positive values are replaced with 1 nanosecond\r\n* core: Improved DEADLINE_EXCEEDED message for delayed calls (6ff8ecac0). Delayed calls are the first calls on a Channel before name resolution has resolved addresses. Previously you could see confusing errors saying the deadline “will be exceeded in” X time. The message tense was simply wrong, and now will be correct: deadline “was exceeded after” X time.\r\n* xds: PriorityLB now only uses the failOverTimer to start additional priorities, not fail RPCs (c4256add4). You should no longer see “Connection timeout for priority” errors.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* netty: Count sent RST_STREAMs against `NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()` limit (#12288). This extends the Rapid Reset tool to also cover MadeYouReset. the reset stream count will cause a 420 \"Enhance your calm response\" to be sent. This depends on Netty 4.1.124 for a bug fix to actually call the encoder by the frame writer.\r\n* xds: Convert CdsLb to `XdsDepManager` (297ab05ef). This is part of gRFC A74 to have atomic xDS config updates. This is an internal change, but does change the error description seen in certain cases, especially DEADLINE_EXCEEDED on a brand-new channel.\r\n* census: APIs for stats and tracing (#12050) (919370172). Client channel and server builders with interceptors and factories respectively for stats and tracing.\r\n* stub: simplify `BlockingClientCall` infinite blocking (#12217) (ba0a7329d). Move deadline computation into overloads with finite timeouts. Blocking calls without timeouts now do not have to read the clock.\r\n* xds: Do RLS fallback policy eagar start (#12211) (42e1829b3). In gRPC-Java, the xDS clusters were lazily subscribed, which meant the fallback target which is returned in the RLS config wasn’t subscribed until a RPC actually falls back to it. The delayed resource subscription process in gRPC Java made it more susceptible to the effects of the INITIAL_RESOURCE_FETCH_TIMEOUT compared to other programming languages. It also had impact beyond the RLS cache expiration case, for example, when the first time the client initialized the channel, we couldn't fallback when the intended target times out, because of the lazy subscription. This change starts the fallback LB policy for the default target at the start of RLS policy instead of only when falling back to the default target, which fixes the above mentioned problems.\r\n* xds: Aggregate cluster fixes (A75) (#12186) (7e982e48a). The earlier implementation of aggregate clusters concatenated the priorities from the underlying clusters into a single list, so that it could use a single LB policy defined at the aggregate cluster layer to choose a priority from that combined list. However, it turns out that aggregate clusters don't actually define the LB policy in the aggregate cluster; instead, the aggregate cluster uses a special cluster-provided LB policy that first chooses the underlying cluster and then delegates to the LB policy of the underlying cluster. This change implements that.\r\n* api: set size correctly for sets and maps in handling `Metadata` values to be exchanged during a call (#12229) (80217275d)\r\n* xds: xdsClient cache transient error for new watchers (#12291). When a resource update is NACKed, cache the error and update new watchers that get added with that error instead of making them hang.\r\n* xds: Avoid PriorityLb re-enabling timer on duplicate CONNECTING (#12289). If a LB policy gives extraneous updates with state CONNECTING, then it was possible to re-create `failOverTimer` which would then wait the 10 seconds for the child to finish CONNECTING. We only want to give the child one opportunity after transitioning out of READY/IDLE.\r\n* xds: Use a different log name for `XdsClientImpl` and `ControlPlaneClient` (#12287). `ControlPlaneClient` uses \"xds-cp-client\" now instead of \"xds-client\" while logging.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies Changes\r\n* Upgrade to Netty 4.1.124.Final (#12286). This implicitly disables `NettyAdaptiveCumulator` (#11284), which can have a performance impact. We delayed upgrading Netty to give time to rework the optimization, but we've gone too long already without upgrading which causes problems for vulnerability tracking.\r\n* bazel: Use `jar_jar` to avoid xds deps (#12243) (8f09b9689). The //xds and //xds:orca targets now use `jar_jar` to shade the protobuf generated code. This allows them to use their own private copy of the protos and drop direct Bazel dependencies on cel-spec, grpc, rules_go, com_github_cncf_xds, envoy_api, com_envoyproxy_protoc_gen_validate, and opencensus_proto. This mirrors the shading of protobuf messages done for grpc-xds provided on Maven Central and should simplify dependency management\r\n * Protobuf upgraded to 3.25.8\r\n * proto-google-common-protos upgraded to 2.59.2\r\n * s2a-proto upgraded to 1.1.2\r\n * google-cloud-logging upgraded to 3.23.1 (used by gcp-observability)\r\n * OpenTelemetry upgraded to 1.52.0\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Clarify requirements for creating a cross-user Channel. (#12181). The `@SystemApi` runtime visibility requirement isn't really new. It has always been implicit in the required INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS permission, which can only be held by system apps in production. Now deprecated `BinderChannelBuilder#bindAsUser` has always required SDK_INT >= 30. This change just copies that requirement forward to its replacement APIs in `AndroidComponentAddress` and the TARGET_ANDROID_USER `NameResolver.Args`.\r\n* api: Add more Javadoc for `NameResolver.Listener2` interface (#12220) (d352540a0)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@benjaminp \r\n@werkt \r\n@kilink \r\n@vimanikag ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/241509460/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":4},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/235779952","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/235779952/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/235779952/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.74.0","id":235779952,"author":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4ODbdw","tag_name":"v1.74.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.74.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-07-25T17:09:17Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T23:13:24Z","published_at":"2025-07-28T23:13:24Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.74.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.74.0","body":"### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n* compiler: Default to `@generated=omit` (f8700a13a). This omits `javax.annotation.Generated` from the generated code and makes the `org.apache.tomcat:annotations-api` compile-only dependency unnecessary (README and examples changes forthcoming; we delayed those changes until the release landed). You can use the option `@generated=javax` for the previous behavior, but please also file an issue so we can develop alternatives  \r\n* compiler: generate blocking v2 unary calls that throw StatusException (\\#12126) (a16d65591). Previously, the new blocking stub API was identical to the older blocking stub for unary RPCs and used the unchecked `StatusRuntimeException`. However, feedback demonstrated it was confusing to mix that with the checked `StatusException` in `BlockingClientCall`. Now the new blocking stub uses StatusException throughout. grpc-java continues to support the old generated code, but the version of protoc-gen-grpc-java will dictate which API you see. If you support multiple generated code versions, you can use the older blocking v1 stub for unary RPCs\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* netty: Fix a race that caused RPCs to hang on start when a GOAWAY was received while the RPCs’ headers were being written to the OS (b04c673fd, 15c757398). This was a very old race, not a recent regression. All streams should now properly fail instead of hanging, although in some cases they may be transparently retried  \r\n* util: OutlierDetection should use nanoTime, not currentTimeMillis (\\#12110) (1c4309899). Previously, changes in the wall time would impact its accounting  \r\n* xds: Don't allow hostnames in address field in EDS (\\#12123) (482dc5c1c). Only IP addresses were handled properly, and only IP addresses should be handled per gRFC A27  \r\n* xds: In resource handling, call onError() for RDS and EDS NACKs (\\#12122) (efe9ccc22). Previously the resource was NACKed, but gRPC would continue waiting for the resource until a timeout was reached and claim the control plane didn’t send the resource. Now it will fail quickly with an informative error  \r\n* xds: Implement equals in RingHashConfig (a5eaa66cc). Previously all configuration refreshes were considered a new config, which had the potential for causing unexpected inefficiency problems. This was noticed by new code for gRFC A74 xDS Config Tears that is not yet enabled, so there are no known problems that this caused  \r\n* LBs should avoid calling LBs after lb.shutdown() (1df2a3305). This fixed pick\\_first and ring\\_hash behavior that could cause rare and “random” races in parent load balancers like a `NullPointerException` in `ClusterImplLoadBalancer.createSubchannel()`, which had a ring\\_hash child. This is most likely to help xDS, as it heavily uses hierarchical LB policies\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* util: Deliver addresses in a random order to shuffle connection creation ordering (f07eb47ca). Previously, connections were created in-order (but non-blocking), so in a fast network the first address could be more likely to connect first given a \"microsecond\" headstart. That first connection then receives all the buffered RPCs, which could cause temporary, but repeated, load imbalances of the same backend when all clients receive the same list of addresses in the same order. This has been seen in practice, but it is unclear how often it happens. Shuffling has the potential to improve load distribution of new clients when using round\\_robin, weighted\\_round\\_robin, and least\\_request, which connect simultaneously to multiple addresses\r\n* core: Use lazy message formatting in checkState (\\#12144) (26bd0eee4). This avoids the potential of unnecessarily formatting an exception as a string when a subchannel fails to connect  \r\n* bazel: Migrate java\\_grpc\\_library to use DefaultInfo (\\#12148) (6f69363d9). This adds compatibility for `--incompatible_disable_target_default_provider_fields`  \r\n* binder: Rationalize @ThreadSafe-ty inside BinderTransport (\\#12130) (c20642874)  \r\n* binder: Cancel checkAuthorization() request if still pending upon termination (\\#12167) (30d40a617)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* compiler: Upgrade Protobuf C++ to 22.5 (\\#11961) (46485c8b6). This is used by the pre-built protoc-gen-grpc-java plugin on Maven Central. This should have no visible benefit, but gets us closer to upgrading to Protobuf 27 which added edition 2023 support  \r\n* release: Migrate artifacts publishing changed from legacy OSSRH to Central Portal (\\#12156) (f99b2aaef).

It is rarely used outside of gRPC itself. The configuration is passed as lb policy configuration instead\r\n- xds: Add support for custom per-target credentials on the transport (#11951) (1958e4237)\r\n- xds: Explicitly set request hash key for the ring hash LB policy (892144dca)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- core: Apply ManagedChannelImpl's updateBalancingState() immediately (ca4819ac6)\r\n- xds: Fix cluster selection races when updating config selector (d82613a74)\r\n- otel: Fix span names as per the A72 gRFC changes (#11974) (94f8e9369)\r\n- xds: ClusterResolverLoadBalancer handle update for both resolved addresses and errors via ResolutionResult (#11997) (868178651)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- netty: Avoid allocating an exception on transport shutdown. This reduces allocation rate for connection-heavy workloads/load testing (a57c14a51)\r\n- servlet: Set an explicit description for CANCELLED status (#11927) (fca1d3cf4)\r\n- xds: [gRFC A74 xDS Config Tears](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A74-xds-config-tears.md) implementation in the XdsNameResolver (e80c19745). While there is more remaining, users may already see reduced latency when resources are replaced. For example, if changing a route from one backend service to another, RPCs may see less latency during the transition\r\n- core: Log any exception during channel panic because of exception (3961a923a). This prevents the exception from propagating up the stack on an arbitrary thread. Such exceptions are rarely interesting. Instead, the exception that caused the channel panic is the important one, and RPCs will still fail with its details\r\n- util: Graceful switch to new LB when leaving CONNECTING (2e260a4bb). Previously when using xDS and the configuration changes the LB policy, the old LB policy is used until the new one is READY. Now the old LB policy is used until the new policy becomes READY, TRANSIENT_FAILURE, or IDLE\r\n- core: Use java.time.Time.getNano directly in InstantTimeProvider. Previously reflection was used which would confuse R8 full mode (#11977) (7507a9ec0)\r\n- core: Avoid cancellation exceptions when notifying watchers that already have their connections cancelled (#11934) (350f90e1a)\r\n- rls: allow maxAge in RLS config to exceed 5 minutes if staleAge is set. Previously, the limit was 5 minutes, which isn't enough for some gRPC clients (#11931) (c340f4a2f)\r\n- xds: avoid unnecessary dns lookup for CIDR addresses (#11932) (602aece08)\r\n- netty: Swap to UniformStreamByteDistributor (#11954) (2f52a0036). gRPC will no longer observe the HTTP/2 priorities, which were not used directly by gRPC and deprecated in RFC 9113\r\n- core: Avoid Set.removeAll() when passing a possibly-large List (#11994) (666136b4b)\r\n- stub: trailersFromThrowable() metadata should be copied (#11979) (a6e1c1f09)\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- xds: xDS-based HTTP CONNECT configuration (#11861) (12197065f)\r\n- netty: Per-rpc authority verification against peer cert subject names. Overriding transport authority at rpc time is only allowed when using TlsChannelCredentials. The per-rpc authority verification feature is guarded by the environment variable GRPC_ENABLE_PER_RPC_AUTHORITY_CHECK in this release. When this is false or not set, the rpc will not fail when the authority verification fails but a warning will be logged. In a subsequent release the usage of this environment variable will be removed and RPCs will start failing if the authority doesn't match the peer certificate names. The environment variable is temporary; if you are depending on the existing insecure behavior, please file an issue (#11724) (cdab410b8)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@panchenko\r\n@emmanuel-ferdman\r\n@JoeCqupt\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/213005406/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":3},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/203912440","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/203912440/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/203912440/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.71.0","id":203912440,"author":{"login":"kannanjgithub","id":29600796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjAwNzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29600796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub","html_url":"https://github.com/kannanjgithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kannanjgithub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacgBs4MJ3T4","tag_name":"v1.71.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"V1.71.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-03-04T14:23:22Z","updated_at":"2025-03-05T17:24:38Z","published_at":"2025-03-05T17:15:56Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/tarball/v1.71.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/zipball/v1.71.0","body":"## API Changes\r\n\r\n* xds: Enable Xds Client Fallback by default.  This allows having a backup xDS server as described in gRFC [A71-xds-fallback.md](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A71-xds-fallback.md) (#11817) (176f3eed1)\r\n* protobuf: Experimental API marshallerWithRecursionLimit in `ProtoUtils` is now stabilized (#11884) (90b1c4fe9)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* xds: Cluster weights should be uint32 (199a7ea3e). They were previously processed as int32, although the sum of weights was checked to be positive. So this would have caused a very large weight to never be selected and to reduce the chances of immediately-following clusters to be selected. There have been no reports of control planes using such large weights\r\n* xds: Fix an unlikely infinite loop triggered by route update (199a7ea3e). Triggering required the old cluster to no longer be used, an RPC processing when the update arrived, and for a RPC to not match any route in the new config. There have been no reports of this actually happening\r\n* core: Release data frame if it is received before the headers (dc316f7fd)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* Replace jsr305's `CheckReturnValue` with Error Prone's (#11811) (7b5d0692c)\r\n* core: optimize number of buffer allocations for message sizes larger than 1 MB (#11879) (5a7f35053)\r\n* core: Update the retry backoff range from [0, 1] to [0.8, 1.2] as per the A6 redefinition (#11858) (44e92e2c2)\r\n* core: include last pick status in status message when wait-for-ready RPC’s deadline expires (#11851) (7585b1607). This makes it much easier to debug connectivity issues when using wait-for-ready RPCs\r\n* xds: Include max concurrent request limit in the error status for concurrent connections limit exceeded (#11845) (0f5503ebb)\r\n* netty, servlet: Remove 4096 min write buffer size because `MessageFramer`.flush() is being called between every message, so messages are never combined and the larger allocation just wastes memory. (4a10a3816, 7153ff852)\r\n* core: When `ClientStreamObserver` closes the response observer log the error message if this operation fails (#11880) (302342cfc)\r\n* bom: use gradle java-platform to build pom instead of custom xml generation (#11875) (3142928fa)\r\n* xds: Reuse filter interceptors on client-side across RPCs (c506190b0, b3db8c248).

This fixes a regression introduced in 1.64.0. The regression should have caused failures on API level 23 and earlier when a StatusRuntimeException or StatusException was created. However, for unknown reasons tests on old devices didn’t notice issues  \r\n* okhttp: Improve certificate handling by rejecting non-ASCII subject alternative names and hostnames as seen in CVE-2021-0341 (\\#11749) (a0982ca0a). Hostnames are considered trusted and CAs are required to use punycode for non-ASCII hostnames, so this is expected to provide defense-in-depth.

This (along with 6c12c2bd2) fixes a nonce-handling regression introduced in 1.66.0 that could cause resources to appear to not exist until re-creating the ADS stream. Triggering the behavior required specific config changes. It is easiest to trigger when clusters use EDS and routes are changed from one cluster to another.

(\\#11775) (1126a8e30)  \r\n* xds: Fix XDS control plane client retry timer backoff duration when connection closes after results are received (\\#11766) (ef7c2d59c)  \r\n* xds: Parsing xDS Cluster Metadata (\\#11741) (1edc4d84d). Not used actively, but this adds validation. The validation is unlikely to fail but may reject invalid resources.  \r\n* xds: Use \"\\#server\" as dataplane target value for xDS enabled gRPC servers (\\#11715) (ebb43a69e). This only impacts the `grpc.target` label in `grpc.xds_client.*` metrics. Previously the empty string was used  \r\n* rls: Reduce RLS debug channel logging (7f9c1f39f).

This fix was in 1.67.1 but not 1.68.0\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n* core: JSON parsing rejects duplicate keys in objects (\\#11575) (4be69e3f8). This is the existing behavior in C core. Duplicate keys in objects are dangerous as which value takes effect is undefined. Previously, the last value was used  \r\n* okhttp: Detect transport executors with no remaining threads (\\#11503) (3a6be9ca1). The transport uses two threads, but one is on-demand. If the executor provided to `builder.transportExecutor()` runs out of threads (e.g., it is a fixed-size thread pool), *all* transports can be wedged, unable to run on-demand tasks, until keepalive kills one of them. Two threads are now used when handshaking a new transport, and the transport will time out after 1 second with “Timed out waiting for second handshake thread” if two threads are unavailable  \r\n* gcp-csm-o11y: Get  `mesh_id` value from `CSM_MESH_ID` environment variable, instead of getting it from bootstrap file (84d30afad)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* New grpc-context-override-opentelemetry artifact (\\#11523) (782a44ad6) (\\#11599) (e59ae5fad). This is a `io.grpc.Context` storage override to store its state in `io.opentelemetry.context.Context`. Libraries should not add a dependency on this artifact, as applications can only have one storage override in their classpath  \r\n* New grpc-s2a artifact. It is a transport that offloads the handshake similar to ALTS, but for TLS. It provides `io.grpc.s2a.S2AChannelCredentials`  \r\n* api: Enhance name resolver \\`ResolutionResult\\` to hold addresses or error so the single listener API *onResult2* is used to convey both success and error cases for name resolution (\\#11330) (1ded8aff8)  \r\n* core: Handle NameResolver/LoadBalancer exceptions when panicking (b692b9d26). This expands the class of bugs that will fail RPCs with the panic error, versus some undefined behavior  \r\n* core: Use the default service config in case of initial name resolver address resolution error (\\#11577) (fa26a8bc5)  \r\n* core: `StreamTracer.inboundMessageRead()` now reports uncompressed message size when the message does not need compression (\\#11598) (2aae68e11). Previously it always reported `-1` (unknown)  \r\n* netty: Avoid TCP\\_USER\\_TIMEOUT warning when explicitly specifying a non-epoll channel type to use (\\#11564) (62f409810)  \r\n* okhttp: Don't warn about missing Conscrypt (6f3542297). This is especially helpful when using TLS but not running on Android  \r\n* android: For `UdsChannelBuilder`, use fake IP instead of localhost (a908b5e40). This avoids an unnecessary DNS lookup  \r\n* xds: Add xDS node ID in select control plane errors to enable cross-referencing with control plane logs when debugging (f3cf7c3c7)  \r\n* xds: Enhanced how ADS stream terminations are handled, specifically addressing cases where a response has or hasn't been received (\\#2e9c3e19f)  \r\n* binder: Update status code documentation for Android 11's package visibility rules. (\\#11551) (99be6e985)  \r\n* binder: Update binderDied() error description to spell out the possibilities for those unfamiliar with Android internals. (\\#11628) (46c1b387f)  \r\n* example-gauth: Use application default creds instead of file argument (\\#11595) (94a0a0d1c)\r\n* opentelemetry: Experimental OpenTelemetry tracing is available. Set the `GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_OTEL_TRACING` environment variable to `true` to enable tracing support in `GrpcOpenTelemetry` (\\#11409, \\#11477)(043ba55, 421e237)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Updated protobuf-java to 3.25.5.

There was a problem making the release and it went to Maven Central as 1.68.0 instead. This is a version-corrected release.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Petiole load balancing policies (e.g., round\\_robin, weighted\\_round\\_robin, ring\\_hash, least\\_request) had internal refactorings. This should not have changed their behavior  \r\n* api: Introduce onResult2 in NameResolver Listener2 that returns Status (90d0fabb1)\r\n* core: touch() buffer when detach()ing (e821d5e15). This makes it clearer whether a leak is a gRPC leak or an application leak when the Detachable API is being used  \r\n* example: delete duplicate and unused code in KeepAliveClient.java (6a9bc3ba1)  \r\n* example: Added Dualstack example (\\#11451) (72a977bf7)  \r\n* stub: Add newAttachMetadataServerInterceptor() MetadataUtil (\\#11458) (6dbd1b9d5)\r\n* xds: Separate xds clients for each channel target, each with its own connection to an xds server.

Previously, RLS configuration would not have been updated  \r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* core: Revert \"Enable new PickFirst LB (\\#11348)\" (\\#11425) (cc1cbe987)  \r\n* rls: Fix log statements incorrectly referring to \"LRS\" (\\#11497) (c63e35488)\r\n* util: Stop using SocketAddress.toString() for checking address equality (f866c805c). This change applies to all petiole load balancing policies. For regular usages that use dns name resolution, this is unlikely to matter as the default dns name resolver returns consistent addresses.

(#11320) (25a8b7c50)\r\n * util: Stabilize `AdvancedTlsX509TrustManager`, an `X509ExtendedTrustManager` that allows users to configure advanced TLS features, such as root certificate reloading and peer cert custom verification. (658cbf6cf)\r\n * util: Align AdvancedTlsX509{Key and Trust}Manager. (#11385)\r\n * util: Add `GracefulSwitchLoadBalancer` config (ebed04798) and mark switchTo() deprecated. (85e0a01ec). `GracefulSwitchLoadBalancer` now receives its configuration like a regular load balancer.\r\n * binder: Introduce `AllowSecurityPolicy` to allow calling code to not have to wait on async/slow implementations. `BinderTransport` now submits async implementations to an executor. (#11272) (7fee6a3fe)\r\n * api: Add convenience method in `ServerBuilder` for adding a list of service implementations to the handler registry together. (#11285) (85ed05300)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * examples: Improve example Bazel WORKSPACE to demonstrate referencing grpc-xds. (5ec0187e2)\r\n * examples: Include Bazel bzlmod configuration (36e687f9d). There are now examples for both non-bzlmod and bzlmod.\r\n * core: Fixes to `PickFirstLeafLoadBalancer`\r\n   * Eliminate NPE after recovering from a temporary name resolution failure. (#11298)\r\n   * Deduplicate addresses. (#11342, #11345)\r\n * core: Change default to use the new pick first load balancer (PickFirstLeafLoadBalancer). (#11348)\r\n * core: Use retryThrottling from defaultServiceConfig when the name resolver config doesn't provide this config. (#11274) (062ebb4d7)\r\n * netty: Enable use of Netty 4.1.111 by avoiding the optimization provided by `NettyAdaptiveCumulator` if Netty is on version 4.1.111 or later. (#11367)\r\n * binder: Set a default connect timeout of 60 seconds. (#11359) (21dec3092)\r\n * binder: Make `BinderServer` own `ServerAuthInterceptor`'s executor that helps avoid leaks. (#11293) (15ad9f546)\r\n * services:: Added `ProtoReflectionServiceV1` for the v1 reflection protocol. The preexisting `ProtoReflectionService` implements the v1alpha reflection protocol. (#11237) (0aa976c4e)\r\n \r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* binder: Add missing synchronization to prevent races when calling awaitTermination(). (#11277) (14fd81f59) \r\n* util: Fix `AdvancedTlsX509TrustManager` validation on servers when using SSLSocket. Previously it would try to use a null SSLEngine . (dcb1c018c)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n * compiler: Upgrade from CentOS 7 to AlmaLinux 8 for the pre-compiled Linux protoc-gen-grpc-java (71eb5fb9f). This adds a runtime dependency on libstdc++\r\n * Upgrade animal-sniffer-annotations to 1.24 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade error_prone_annotations to 2.28.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade proto-google-common-protos to 2.41.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade google-auth-library to 1.23.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade gson to 2.11.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade guava to 33.2.1 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade opentelemetry to 1.40.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade perfmark-api to 0.27.0 (a97738518)\r\n * Upgrade protobuf-java to 3.25.3 (a97738518)\r\n * xds: Remove unused opencensus-proto dependency (e7c3803b5)\r\n * bazel: Replace `@com_github_cncf_udpa` usage with preexisting `@com_github_cncf_xds`; delete `@com_github_cncf_udpa` repo alias for xds (6dd6ca9f9)\r\n * bazel: Upgrade envoyproxy/data-plane-api to 1611a730 (c540993aa). The version used by Gradle had been updated in 1.62.0 (68334a01), but the bazel version had not\r\n * bazel: Use com_google_protobuf instead of com_google_protobuf_javalite (7a25e6895). Bazel’s protobuf rules no longer use the old com_google_protobuf_javalite repository name\r\n * bazel: Don't require protobuf to be in maven_install (d3c2f5a2d). Protobuf’s targets are generally just used directly; this fixed the only place that used maven’s `artifact()` syntax\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n\r\n@hlx502

grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * api: Add `ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)` (960012d76).

This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible\r\n * netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (#11294) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption\r\n * okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19).

For Netty 4.1.111 compatibility, it is best to use 1.63.2, 1.64.2, 1.65.1, and later. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11284 ._\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n - compiler: the option `jakarta_omit` was renamed `@generated=omit` (#11086) (8a21afcc9)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n - New API LoadBalancer.getChannelTarget() (4561bb5b8)\r\n - opentelemetry: Publish new module grpc-opentelemetry (5ba1a5563). The feature is still missing documentation and an example. It only supports metrics; tracing and logs will be future enhancements. See [gRFC A66](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A66-otel-stats.md)\r\n - bazel: Add support for bzlmod (#11046) (d1890c0ac)\r\n - bazel: Replace usages of the old compatibility maven targets with `@maven` targets (00649913b)\r\n - okhttp: Support serverBuilder.maxConcurrentCallsPerConnection (Fixes #11062). (#11063) (805072339)\r\n - xds: Experimental metrics recording in WRR LB (06df25b65, 35a171bc1, 2897b3939), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry. See [gRFC A78](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A78-grpc-metrics-wrr-pf-xds.md)\r\n - rls: Experimental metrics recording in RLS LB (a9fb272b7, a1d19327f, 813331837), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n - examples: support bazel build for retry policy example (58de563fa)\r\n - netty: Allow deframer errors to close stream with a status code, as long as headers have not yet been sent (e036b1b19). This will greatly improve the debuggability of certain server errors in particular cases. Instead of the client seeing “CANCELLED: RST_STREAM closed stream. HTTP/2 error code: CANCEL”, they could see “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size 4194304: 6144592”\r\n - netty: Improve handling of unexpected write queue promise failures (#11016)\r\n - servlet: Avoid unnecessary FINEST hex string conversion by checking log level. Fixes #11031.

This disables a performance optimization added in v1.63. (#11120) We have had a report that the new implementation can trigger a NullPointerException\r\n - core: Transition to CONNECTING immediately when exiting idle (2c5f0c22c). Previously the visible state change from `channel.getState()` was delayed until the name resolver returned results. This had no impact to RPC behavior\r\n - xds: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (e6305930d)\r\n - rls: Synchronization fixes in CachingRlsLbClient (6e97b180b). These races had not been witnessed in practice\r\n - rls: Guarantee backoff will update RLS picker (f9b6e5f92). This fixes a regression introduced by 6e97b180b that could hang RPCs instead of using fallback, but fixes a pre-existing bug that could greatly delay RPCs from using fallback.\r\n - rls: Fix time handling in CachingRlsLbClient (da619e2bd). This could have caused backoff entries to improperly be considered expired\r\n - xds: Properly disable the default endpoint identification algorithm with XdsChannelCredentials (097a46b76). The credential does its own verification and the default needs to be disabled for SPIFFE\r\n - netty: Release SendGrpcFrameCommand when stream is missing (#11116) (fb9a10809)\r\n - okhttp: Remove finished stream even if a pending stream was started (d21fe32be)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n - cronet: Update Cronet to latest release + Move to Stable Cronet APIs.

This fixes a possible regression introduced in 1.60.0. Auditing the buggy code showed it unlikely to cause problems in practice, but that was more by happenstance than by design\r\n - xds: Fix data race in the xds client that contacts the control plane (d7628a3ab)\r\n - rls: Fix a local and remote race (aa9076812).

Similarly to ServerTransportFilter, this will provide an observability hook and it allows direct modification of the transport's attributes. (#10646)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n - java_grpc_library.bzl: Add support for Auto Exec Groups (cb03bd234). This is mostly a behind-the-scenes change to adjust to the newer way Bazel operates\r\n- java_grpc_library.bzl: Support runfiles for protoc and the plugin (65a6b3bc2). Neither binary uses runfiles, but the task will be ready if they need to in the future\r\n- xds: Add EC key support for XdsChannelCredentials/XdsServerCredentials (100d5a55f)\r\n- binder:Change log level from WARNING to FINER for expected exception during close with error, to reduce log spamming (#10899) (7ba0718bb)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n  - xds: Fix a bug in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer policy that could raise NullPointerException and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports TRANSIENT_FAILURE state. (#10868)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- The protoc plugin no longer supports macOS Big Sur (macOS 11).

This makes its implementation more similar to `weighted_round_robin`.\r\n- xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (#10674). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (#10739). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.\r\n- util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (#10769)\r\n- util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81). The Gradle test fixtures are for use by grpc-java's internal tests.\r\n- okhttp: Ignore known conscrypt socket close issue (#10812). This stops an exception from being thrown when a known Conscrypt synchronization issue happens.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- Drop support for Bazel 5 (55a9c012c). Bazel 7 is available, and Protobuf has already dropped support for Bazel 5.\r\n- Change many compile deps to runtime deps (d6830d7f9). This reduces the transitive classes \"leaked\" into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (`io.grpc.internal`) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.\r\n- Upgrade dependencies (c985797d9)\r\n  - Protobuf to 3.25.1\r\n  - auto-value-annotations to 1.10.4\r\n  - error_prone_annotations to 2.23.0\r\n  - proto-google-common-protos to 2.29.0\r\n  - google-cloud-logging to 3.15.14\r\n  - guava to 32.1.3-android\r\n  - okio to 3.4.0\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n- @Gordiychuk\r\n- @jroper\r\n- @jyane\r\n-

API Changes\r\n* api: Stabilize `ForwardingServerBuilder`, `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`, and `ForwardingChannelBuilder`. Note that `ForwardingChannelBuilder` is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of `ForwardingChannelBuilder2`. (#10586)\r\n* api: Deprecate `ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()`. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending `ForwardingChannelBuilder` implement the `delegate()` method. See javadoc for details (#10587)\r\n* api: Changed recently-introduced `LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()` to return `Status` instead of `boolean` (#10636). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization\r\n* stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (#10654)\r\n* alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends `ForwardingChannelBuilder2` (#10587)\r\n* protobuf: Stabilize `ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()` (#10628)\r\n* protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (#10627)\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n * core: `ManagedChannel`s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs\r\n * core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the `Status.UNKNOWN` returned to the client will have `Application error processing RPC` description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (#10643)\r\n * xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n * Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug\r\n * core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (#9314). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses\r\n * util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util\r\n * netty: Implement `Http2Headers.isEmpty()`. This fixes compatibility with Netty 4.1.101.Final.\r\n * netty: Add `NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()`. This can be used to limit impact of Rapid Reset\r\n * netty: Disable huffman coding in headers (#10563). Huffman coding provides modest compression for relatively high CPU usage, especially within a data center. Rely just on the HPACK static and dynamic tables for compression, for higher performance. This only impacts header values 512 bytes or longer, as Netty already disabled Huffman for smaller values\r\n * alts: Improve handshake failure error message by propagating original exception (#10644)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n * util: Remove shutdown subchannels from OD tracking (#10683). This could have caused a memory leak on a long-lived channel. But we don’t think it could be triggered with our built-in load balancing policies.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n * Bump Netty to 4.1.100.Final\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n@anthonyjpratti\r\n@fedorka\r\n@jpd236\r\n@mateusazis\r\n@pkoenig10\r\n@yannickepstein\r\n@amirhadadi","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-java/releases/132721882/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":7}]
