(#40750)\r\n  * Note: using async methods outside of a running event loop is [discouraged](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio-policies) by Python, and **will be deprecated in future gRPC releases**. Please use the [asyncio.run()](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run) function (or [asyncio.Runner](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner) for custom loop factories). For interactive mode, use dedicated [asyncio REPL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#asyncio-cli): `python -m asyncio`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/compare/v1.75.0...v1.75.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/releases/250213263/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/releases/247456001","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/releases/247456001/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/releases/247456001/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/releases/tag/v1.75.0","id":247456001,"author":{"login":"apolcyn","id":9566254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NjYyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9566254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn","html_url":"https://github.com/apolcyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apolcyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAacf2M4Ov-EB","tag_name":"v1.75.0","target_commitish":"v1.75.x","name":"Release v1.75.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-09-15T16:21:36Z","updated_at":"2025-09-25T01:18:03Z","published_at":"2025-09-15T22:33:44Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/tarball/v1.75.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/zipball/v1.75.0","body":"This is release 1.75.0 ([gemini](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/g_stands_for.md)) of gRPC Core.\r\n\r\nFor gRPC documentation, see [grpc.io](https://grpc.io/).

([#40515](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/40515))\r\n-  [Python][Typeguard] Part 3 - Add Typeguard to AIO stack in tests. ([#40217](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/40217))\r\n-  [c-ares] update version to 1.34.5. ([#39508](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/39508))\r\n-  [pick_first] fix bug that caused us to stop attempting to connect.

([#40146](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/40146))\r\n\r\nPython\r\n---\r\n\r\n* gRPC Python (grpcio) now depends on `typing-extensions~=4.13`. (#40137)\r\n* Update musllinux wheels from `musllinux_1_1` to `musllinux_1_2`. (#40317)\r\n  * Dropping `musllinux_1_1` because it reached EOL in November 2024\r\n  * Reference on musllinux platform tags: [PEP 656](https://peps.python.org/pep-0656)\r\n* `grpc.aio` typehint fixes. (#40215, #40217)\r\n  * Metadata type validation: Fixed metadata handling to support all sequence types (not just tuples), preventing runtime errors. Enhanced metadata type validation: `isinstance(metadata, Sequence)` instead of `isinstance(metadata, tuple)`\r\n  * Serializer parameters: Changed to `Optional[SerializingFunction]` for more accurate type representation\r\n  * Fixing the error in public API: `ClientCallDetails.method` was declared as `str` but always called with `bytes`, see [InterceptedUnaryUnaryCall](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/49bc1b1098f3772b40a46325250fe5c6f4df1eeb/src/python/grpcio/grpc/aio/_interceptor.py#L628).   \r\n* Fixes issue #40325 with grpcio failing to install on all non-Mac Apple devices internal builds.
