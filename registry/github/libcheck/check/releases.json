This\r\n  allow build output to be reproducible.\r\n  Bug #112\r\n- Use double slash for regular expressions in checkmk for better Solaris support.\r\n- Improve CMake build files for better Visual Studio 2015 support.\r\n  Pull Request #19\r\n- Fix potential SIGSEGV in Check related to the disk filling up during a test.\r\n  Pull Request #21\r\n- Support added for applying tags to test cases and selectively running\r\n  test cases based on tags.\r\n  Pull Request #44\r\n- Macros for comparing memory regions (ck_assert_mem_eq, ck_assert_mem_ne)\r\n  have been added.\r\n  Pull Request #64\r\n- Macros for comparing floating point numbers have been added.\r\n  Pull Request #69\r\n- Macros for comparing string, but allowing for NULL (ck_assert_pstr_eq,\r\n  ck_assert_pstr_ne) have been added.\r\n  Pull Request #80\r\n- Macros for checking if a pointer is NULL or not have been added.\r\n  Pull Request #87\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/libcheck/check/0.11.0/check-0.11.0.tar.gz.svg\" alt=\"Downloads\"/></a>"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/releases/2336346","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/releases/2336346/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/releases/2336346/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libcheck/check/releases/tag/0.10.0","id":2336346,"author":{"login":"brarcher","id":5264535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher","html_url":"https://github.com/brarcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIzMzYzNDY=","tag_name":"0.10.0","target_commitish":"ad83496d1aea4d1d700d6acbec526fa2a2271968","name":"Check version 0.10.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-08-02T19:49:53Z","published_at":"2015-12-24T03:10:48Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/releases/assets/1873214","id":1873214,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE4NzMyMTQ=","name":"check-0.10.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"brarcher","id":5264535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher","html_url":"https://github.com/brarcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brarcher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":769119,"download_count":10450,"created_at":"2016-06-20T03:43:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T03:43:22Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libcheck/check/releases/download/0.10.0/check-0.10.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/tarball/0.10.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libcheck/check/zipball/0.10.0","body":"In addition to a few bug fixes and improvements, the handing of Check when compiled without fork() has changed slightly. Several API calls in the past would intentionally result in errors when they required fork() to make sense. However this has been changed to instead ignore the call. This should help improve unit test interoperability between *nix and Windows.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- CMake on MinGW and MSVC was unable to find time related types because\r\n  time.h was not included. This header is now included for the checks.\r\n- If the test runner process catches a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal the running\r\n  tests are now also killed.\r\n- If Check is compiled without support for fork(), the behavior of\r\n  functions which require fork() to be useful have been changed.\r\n  Functions that attempt to set CK_FORK mode are no-ops,\r\n  check_fork() returns in failure, and check_waitpid_and_exit()\r\n  exits in failure.\r\n- Add space around operators in assert messages for readability.\r\n- Use mkstemp() if available instead of tmpfile() or tempnam().\r\n- Fix issue with string formatting in ck_assert(), where using\r\n  the % operator would be interpreted as a string formatter\r\n- In nofork mode, the location of a failed assertion within a test\r\n  case was lost if that test case has a checked teardown fixture\r\n  (even if that fixture function is empty). This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/libcheck/check/0.10.0/check-0.10.0.tar.gz.svg\" alt=\"Downloads\"/></a>"}]
