2.87 has improved support for robotics, reinforcement learning and VR. In particular, see the \"Reinforcement Learning\" section in the pybullet quickstart guide at http://pybullet.org . There are also preliminary [C# bindings](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/unity3d/autogen/NativeMethods.cs) to allow the use of pybullet inside Unity 3D for robotics and reinforcement learning.\r\n\r\nHere are some videos: \r\n+ [Minitaur pybullet trained with TF Agents PPO, improved motor model, randomization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfqCHDoFHRQ)\r\n+ [pybullet Ant trained using TensorFlow Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmCH-i9Vfw4)\r\n+ [pybullet KUKA grasp training/enjoy using Tensorflow+OpenAI gym+baselines DQN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzmcRT5rc3c)\r\n\r\nSome example training the pybullet_pendulum using TensorFlow Agents PPO:\r\npip install pybullet, agents, tensorflow, gym\r\n\r\npython -m pybullet_envs.agents.train_ppo --config=pybullet_pendulum --logdir=pendulum\r\ntensorboard --logdir=pendulum --port=2222\r\npython -m pybullet_envs.agents.visualize_ppo --logdir=pendulum/xxxxx --outdir=pendulum_video\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/725468/31039490-dd31bae8-a532-11e7-9958-0906b6265ea9.png)\r\n\r\nTensorboard training progress image for the Minitaur locomotion:\r\n<img width=\"811\" alt=\"minitaur\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/725468/31039612-db32065c-a533-11e7-8926-496b35b11cb5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases/5502475","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases/5502475/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases/5502475/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases/tag/2.86.1","id":5502475,"author":{"login":"erwincoumans","id":725468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/725468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans","html_url":"https://github.com/erwincoumans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erwincoumans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTU1MDI0NzU=","tag_name":"2.86.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Bullet 2.86 with pybullet for robotics, deep learning and VR","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-02-17T23:43:38Z","published_at":"2017-02-19T13:43:45Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bulletphysics/bullet3/tarball/2.86.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bulletphysics/bullet3/zipball/2.86.1","body":"The Bullet 2.86 has improved Python bindings, pybullet, for robotics, machine learning and VR, see the [pybullet quickstart guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the PGS LCP constraint solver has a new option to terminate as soon as the residual (error) is below a specified tolerance (instead of terminating after a fixed number of iterations). There are optional [multithreaded optimizations](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/pull/847), thanks to lunkhound.
