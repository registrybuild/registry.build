Elimination of \"fragment block stall\" and -(not-)reproducible options\r\n\r\n\t\tA technical issue called \"the fragment block stall\" has been\r\n\t\teliminated in this release in a way that generates a\r\n\t\treproducible ordering of files in the filesystem image.  This\r\n\t\tcan increase performance by 20% or more, in addition to the\r\n\t\tparallel reader performance improvements.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis \"fragment block stall\" was introduced in release 4.4 (2019)\r\n\t\tto produce a reproducible ordering of files in the filesystem,\r\n\t\tbut which led to a reduction in parallelisation and performance.\r\n\t\tDue to this reduction, the previous behaviour was retained and\r\n\t\tenabled using the -not-reproducible option.  As the \"fragment\r\n\t\tblock stall\" has now been removed, the options -not-reproducible\r\n\t\tand -reproducible now do nothing, but are still recognised for\r\n\t\tbackwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n\t5. Other improvements for Mksquashfs/Sqfstar\r\n\r\n\t\t3.1 New -force-file-mode option, which sets all file\r\n\t\t    (non-directory) permissions to the given mode.\r\n\t\t3.2 New -force-dir-mode option, which sets all directory\r\n\t\t    permissions to the given mode.\r\n\t\t3.3 -root-mode and above new -force-file-mode/-force-dir-mode\r\n\t\t    options now take a symbolic mode in addition to an octal\r\n\t\t    mode.\r\n\t\t3.4 New -info-file option, which prints files written to the\r\n\t\t    filesystem to a file rather than stdout.  Allows -info-file\r\n\t\t    to be used in conjunction with the progress bar.\r\n\t\t3.5 New -pseudo-dir (or -pd) option which supplies a default\r\n\t\t    directory if any directories in a pseudo file definition\r\n\t\t    pathname doesn't exist.\r\n\t\t3.6 New pseudo file 'h' definition which creates a hard link to\r\n\t\t    a file, and follows symbolic links.\r\n\t\t3.7 Previously if a directory was missing (or not a directory)\r\n\t\t    in a Pseudo file definition pathname, the pseudo file\r\n\t\t    definition would be ignored.  This has been hardened to a\r\n\t\t    fatal error.\r\n\r\n\t6.

Extended attribute handling improved in Unsquashfs\r\n\r\n\t\t2.1 New -xattrs-exclude option to exclude extended attributes\r\n\t\t    from files using a regular expression.\r\n\t\t2.2 New -xattrs-include option to include extended attributes\r\n\t\t    from files using a regular expression.\r\n\t\t2.3 Extended attributes are now supported in Pseudo file output.\r\n\r\n\t3. Other major improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t3.1 Unsquashfs can now output Pseudo files to standard out.\r\n\t\t3.2 Mksquashfs can now input Pseudo files from standard in.\r\n\t\t3.3 Squashfs filesystems can now be converted (different block\r\n\t\t    size compression etc) without unpacking to an intermediate\r\n\t\t    filesystem or mounting, by piping the output of Unsquashfs\r\n\t\t    to Mksquashfs.\r\n\t\t3.4 Pseudo files are now supported by Sqfstar.\r\n\t\t3.5 \"Non-anchored\" excludes are now supported by Unsquashfs.\r\n\r\n\t4. Mksquashfs minor improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t4.1 A new -max-depth option has been added, which limits\r\n\t\t    the depth Mksquashfs descends when creating the filesystem.\r\n\t\t4.2 A new -mem-percent option which allows memory for caches to\r\n\t\t    be specified as a percentage of physical RAM, rather than\t\r\n\t\t    requiring an absolute value.\r\n\t\t4.3 A new -percentage option added which rather than generating\r\n\t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\r\n\t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\r\n\t\t4.4 -mkfs-time, -all-time and -root-time options now take\r\n\t\t    a human date string, in addition to the seconds since\r\n\t\t    the epoch of 1970 00:00 UTC.  For example \"now\",\r\n\t\t    \"last week\", \"Wed Mar 8 05:55:01 GMT 2023\" are supported.\r\n\t\t4.5 -root-uid, -root-gid, -force-uid and -force-gid options now\r\n\t\t     take a user/group name in addition to the integer uid/gid.\r\n\t\t4.6 A new -mem-default option which displays default memory\r\n\t\t    usage for caches in Mbytes.\r\n\t\t4.7 A new -no-compression option which produces no compression,\r\n\t\t    and it is a short-cut for -noI, -noD, -noF and -noX.\r\n\t\t4.8 A new -pseudo-override option which makes pseudo file uids\r\n\t\t    and gids override -all-root, -force-uid and -force-gid\r\n\t\t    options.  Normally these options take precedence.\r\n\r\n\t5. Unsquashfs minor improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t5.1 New -all-time option which sets all file timestamps to\r\n\t\t    <time>, rather than the time stored in the filesystem\r\n\t\t    inode.  <time> can be an integer indicating seconds since\r\n\t\t    the epoch (1970-01-01) or a human string value such as\r\n\t\t    \"now\", \"last week\", or \"Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023\".\r\n\t\t5.2 New -full-precision option which uses full precision when\r\n\t\t    displaying times including seconds.  Use with -linfo, -lls,\r\n\t\t    -lln and -llc options.\r\n\t\t5.3 New -match option where Unsquashfs will abort if any\r\n\t\t    extract file does not match on anything, and can not be\r\n\t\t    resolved.\r\n\t\t5.4 New -percentage option added which rather than generating\r\n\t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\r\n\t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\r\n\r\n\t6. Sqfstar minor improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t6.1 A new -ignore-zeros option added which allows tar files to\r\n\t\t    be concatenated together and fed to Sqfstar.  Normally a\r\n\t\t    tarfile has two consecutive 512 byte blocks filled with\r\n\t\t    zeros which means EOF and Sqfstar will stop reading after\r\n\t\t    the first tar file on encountering them. This option makes\r\n\t\t    Sqfstar ignore the zero filled blocks.\r\n\t\t6.2 A new -mem-percent option which allows memory for caches to\r\n\t\t    be specified as a percentage of physical RAM, rather than\t\r\n\t\t    requiring an absolute value.\r\n\t\t6.3 A new -percentage option added which rather than generating\r\n\t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\r\n\t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\r\n\t\t6.4 -mkfs-time, -all-time and -root-time options now take\r\n\t\t    a human date string, in addition to the seconds since\r\n\t\t    the epoch of 1970 00:00 UTC.  For example \"now\",\r\n\t\t    \"last week\", \"Wed Mar 8 05:55:01 GMT 2023\" are supported.\r\n\t\t6.5 -root-uid, -root-gid, -force-uid and -force-gid options now\r\n\t\t     take a user/group name in addition to the integer uid/gid.\r\n\t\t6.6 A new -mem-default option which displays default memory\r\n\t\t    usage for caches in Mbytes.\r\n\t\t6.7 A new -no-compression option which produces no compression,\r\n\t\t    and it is a short-cut for -noI, -noD, -noF and -noX.\r\n\t\t6.8 A new -pseudo-override option which makes pseudo file uids\r\n\t\t    and gids override -all-root, -force-uid and -force-gid\r\n\t\t    options.  Normally these options take precedence.\r\n\t\t6.9 Do not abort if ZERO filled blocks indicating end of the\r\n\t\t    TAR archive are missing.\r\n\r\n\t7. Other minor improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t7.1 If Mksquashfs/Unsquashfs fails to execute generating the\r\n\t\t    manpages because they have been cross-compiled, fall back\r\n\t\t    to using the pre-built manpages.\r\n\t\t7.2 Add new Makefile configure option USE_PREBUILT_MANPAGES\r\n\t\t    to always use pre-built manpages rather than generating\r\n\t\t    them when \"make install\" is run.\r\n\r\n\t8. Major bug fixes\r\n\r\n\t\t8.1 Following a symlink in Sqfscat or where -follow-symlinks\r\n\t\t    option is given with Unsquashfs, incorrectly triggered the\r\n\t\t    corrupted filesystem loop detection code.\r\n\t\t8.2 In Unsquashfs if a file was not writable it could not add\r\n\t\t    extended attributes to it.\r\n\t\t8.3 Sqfstar would incorrectly reject compressor specific\r\n\t\t    options that have an argument.\r\n\t\t8.4 Sqfstar would incorrectly strip pathname components in PAX\r\n\t\t    header linkpath if symbolic.\r\n\t\t8.5 Sqfstar -root-uid, -root-gid and -root-time options were\r\n\t\t    documented but not implemented.\r\n\t\t8.6 Mksquashfs -one-file-system option would not create empty\r\n\t\t    mount point directory when filesystem boundary crossed.\r\n\t\t8.7 Mksquashfs did not check the close() return result.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/releases/96053396/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/releases/62133574","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/releases/62133574/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/releases/62133574/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools/releases/tag/4.5.1","id":62133574,"author":{"login":"plougher","id":1834249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1834249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher","html_url":"https://github.com/plougher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plougher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAGMTes4DtBVG","tag_name":"4.5.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Squashfs tools 4.5.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-03-17T19:40:43Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T19:53:55Z","published_at":"2022-03-17T19:53:55Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/tarball/4.5.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plougher/squashfs-tools/zipball/4.5.1","body":"This release adds Manpages, a fix for CVE-2021-41072 and the usual minor\r\nimprovements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n\t1. Major improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t1.1 This release adds Manpages for Mksquashfs(1), Unsquashfs(1),\r\n\t\t    Sqfstar(1) and Sqfscat(1).\r\n\t\t1.2 The -help text output from the utilities has been improved\r\n\t\t    and extended as well (but the Manpages are now more\r\n\t\t    comprehensive).\r\n\t\t1.3 CVE-2021-41072 which is a writing outside of destination\r\n\t\t    exploit, has been fixed.\r\n\r\n\t2. Minor improvements\r\n\r\n\t\t2.1 The number of hard-links in the filesystem is now also\r\n\t\t    displayed by Mksquashfs in the output summary.\r\n\t\t2.2 The number of hard-links written by Unsquashfs is now\r\n\t\t    also displayed in the output summary.\r\n\t\t2.3 Unsquashfs will now write to a pre-existing destination\r\n\t\t    directory, rather than aborting.\r\n\t\t2.4 Unsquashfs now allows \".\" to used as the destination, to\r\n\t\t    extract to the current directory.\r\n\t\t2.5 The Unsquashfs progress bar now tracks empty files and\r\n\t\t    hardlinks, in addition to data blocks.\r\n\t\t2.6 -no-hardlinks option has been implemented for Sqfstar.\r\n\t\t2.7 More sanity checking for \"corrupted\" filesystems, including\r\n\t\t    checks for multiply linked directories and directory loops.\r\n\t\t2.8 Options that may cause filesystems to be unmountable have\r\n\t\t    been moved into a new \"experts\" category in the Mksquashfs\r\n\t\t    help text (and Manpage).\r\n\r\n\t3. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n\t\t3.1 Maximum cpiostyle filename limited to PATH_MAX.  This\r\n\t\t    prevents attempts to overflow the stack, or cause system\r\n\t\t    calls to fail with a too long pathname.\r\n\t\t3.2 Don't always use \"max open file limit\" when calculating\r\n\t\t    length of queues, as a very large file limit can cause\r\n\t\t    Unsquashfs to abort.  Instead use the smaller of max open\r\n\t\t    file limit and cache size.\r\n\t\t3.3 Fix Mksquashfs silently ignoring Pseudo file definitions\r\n\t\t    when appending.\r\n\t\t3.4 Don't abort if no XATTR support has been built in, and\r\n\t\t    there's XATTRs in the filesystem.  This is a regression\r\n\t\t    introduced in 2019 in Version 4.4.\r\n\t\t3.5 Fix duplicate check when the last file block is sparse.\r\n"}]
