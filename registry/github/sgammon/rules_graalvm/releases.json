your `java_runtime_version` would be `example_21`, and your toolchain repo would be `@example_toolchains`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a point release which only applies fixes,

This use is no longer supported because older versions of `native-image` show incompatibilities with Bazel's process wrapper.\r\n\r\n- **Native image builds will now respect Bazel flags like `--compilation_mode=opt`.**\r\n  Defaults have been left to GraalVM to maintain backward compatibility with the default case, which builds binaries with `-O2` (optimizations on). However, this is still a breaking change because the behavior will be different if `--compilation_mode` was being explicitly set to any value other than `opt`. Note that Bazel's default value of `fastbuild` also applies here, so passing _no value at all_ **will** result in a behavior change (`opt` → `fastbuild`).\r\n\r\n- **The order of options passed to `native-image` has changed.**\r\n  Attributes like `extra_args` now pass later on the command line (last, actually, for `extra_args`); because `native-image` options are last-wins, this should allow overriding _any_ of the flags injected by the rules. This should offer users a path forward even if the flags passed by the rules are incompatible in some way. This change in the order of action arguments may result in cache misses. Otherwise, this change should be transparent to rule users.\r\n\r\n- **Hermetic build environment improvements.**\r\n  The parameter `use_default_shell_env` is no longer passed to the underlying `native-image` compile action; instead, the toolchain environment is assembled for strict use. Native compiler environment variables like `INCLUDE`, `LIB`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and `SDKROOT` no longer need to be passed via `--action_env`.\r\n\r\n- **Toolchain targets and registration.**\r\n  See below for an exhaustive description, but basically, the registration calls for toolchains need to change, but only for users who are consuming via Bzlmod.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes: Toolchain registration\r\n\r\nWhen registering toolchains in a Bzlmod installation of these rules, the target `@graalvm//:all` must be changed to two toolchain registrations, based on the desired functionality:\r\n\r\n**Register the Java toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Register the GVM toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain_gvm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To keep the `:all` target:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:all\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix: replace remaining usage of `versions.get()` by @fmeum in

This use is no longer supported because older versions of `native-image` show incompatibilities with Bazel's process wrapper.\r\n\r\n- **Native image builds will now respect Bazel flags like `--compilation_mode=opt`.**\r\n  Defaults have been left to GraalVM to maintain backward compatibility with the default case, which builds binaries with `-O2` (optimizations on). However, this is still a breaking change because the behavior will be different if `--compilation_mode` was being explicitly set to any value other than `opt`. Note that Bazel's default value of `fastbuild` also applies here, so passing _no value at all_ **will** result in a behavior change (`opt` → `fastbuild`).\r\n\r\n- **The order of options passed to `native-image` has changed.**\r\n  Attributes like `extra_args` now pass later on the command line (last, actually, for `extra_args`); because `native-image` options are last-wins, this should allow overriding _any_ of the flags injected by the rules.

This use is no longer supported because older versions of `native-image` show incompatibilities with Bazel's process wrapper.\r\n\r\n- **Native image builds will now respect Bazel flags like `--compilation_mode=opt`.**\r\n  Defaults have been left to GraalVM to maintain backward compatibility with the default case, which builds binaries with `-O2` (optimizations on). However, this is still a breaking change because the behavior will be different if `--compilation_mode` was being explicitly set to any value other than `opt`. Note that Bazel's default value of `fastbuild` also applies here, so passing _no value at all_ **will** result in a behavior change (`opt` → `fastbuild`).\r\n\r\n- **The order of options passed to `native-image` has changed.**\r\n  Attributes like `extra_args` now pass later on the command line (last, actually, for `extra_args`); because `native-image` options are last-wins, this should allow overriding _any_ of the flags injected by the rules. This should offer users a path forward even if the flags passed by the rules are incompatible in some way. This change in the order of action arguments may result in cache misses. Otherwise, this change should be transparent to rule users.\r\n\r\n- **Hermetic build environment improvements.**\r\n  The parameter `use_default_shell_env` is no longer passed to the underlying `native-image` compile action; instead, the toolchain environment is assembled for strict use. Native compiler environment variables like `INCLUDE`, `LIB`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and `SDKROOT` no longer need to be passed via `--action_env`.\r\n\r\n- **Toolchain targets and registration.**\r\n  See below for an exhaustive description, but basically, the registration calls for toolchains need to change, but only for users who are consuming via Bzlmod.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes: Toolchain registration\r\n\r\nWhen registering toolchains in a Bzlmod installation of these rules, the target `@graalvm//:all` must be changed to two toolchain registrations, based on the desired functionality:\r\n\r\n**Register the Java toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Register the GVM toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain_gvm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To keep the `:all`

Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a hotfix release for the [`0.10.x`](https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/pull/80) release of `rules_graalvm`. This release is _identical_ to `0.10.0`, except that it works over BCR (there were some [fingerprint issues](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry/pull/836) when publishing, and that release will be yanked as a result). This release of the rules is pretty big and includes the following major updates:\r\n\r\n- Ability to easily use Maven artifacts from the GraalVM team\r\n- Lazy downloads of GraalVM toolchains\r\n- Many bugfixes\r\n- Hermetic compiler support on macOS, Linux, and Windows\r\n- ... and more! See the full set of changes summarized below.\r\n\r\nThis release includes contributions from:\r\n- Sam Gammon, Elide (@sgammon)\r\n- Mantas Indrašius, Wix (@mantasindrasius)\r\n- Fabian Meumertzheim, Code Intelligence (@fmeum)\r\n\r\nThis release included @mantasindrasius and @fmeum 's first contributions 🥳  Thank you to all who contributed!\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT] \r\n> There are some **backward-incompatible** changes in this release which involve the way toolchains are registered. Most users should have no problem upgrading; if you are using `@graalvm_toolchain_config_repo` targets directly, you will need to change them to `@graalvm_toolchains`.

This use is no longer supported because older versions of `native-image` show incompatibilities with Bazel's process wrapper.\r\n\r\n- **Native image builds will now respect Bazel flags like `--compilation_mode=opt`.**\r\n  Defaults have been left to GraalVM to maintain backward compatibility with the default case, which builds binaries with `-O2` (optimizations on). However, this is still a breaking change because the behavior will be different if `--compilation_mode` was being explicitly set to any value other than `opt`. Note that Bazel's default value of `fastbuild` also applies here, so passing _no value at all_ **will** result in a behavior change (`opt` → `fastbuild`).\r\n\r\n- **The order of options passed to `native-image` has changed.**\r\n  Attributes like `extra_args` now pass later on the command line (last, actually, for `extra_args`); because `native-image` options are last-wins, this should allow overriding _any_ of the flags injected by the rules. This should offer users a path forward even if the flags passed by the rules are incompatible in some way. This change in the order of action arguments may result in cache misses. Otherwise, this change should be transparent to rule users.\r\n\r\n- **Hermetic build environment improvements.**\r\n  The parameter `use_default_shell_env` is no longer passed to the underlying `native-image` compile action; instead, the toolchain environment is assembled for strict use. Native compiler environment variables like `INCLUDE`, `LIB`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and `SDKROOT` no longer need to be passed via `--action_env`.\r\n\r\n- **Toolchain targets and registration.**\r\n  See below for an exhaustive description, but basically, the registration calls for toolchains need to change, but only for users who are consuming via Bzlmod.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes: Toolchain registration\r\n\r\nWhen registering toolchains in a Bzlmod installation of these rules, the target `@graalvm//:all` must be changed to two toolchain registrations, based on the desired functionality:\r\n\r\n**Register the Java toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Register the GVM toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain_gvm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To keep the `:all` target:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:all\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PRs and issues\r\n\r\n**Mainline work:**\r\n- [feat: graalvm artifact mappings](#106)\r\n- [fix: install

This use is no longer supported because older versions of `native-image` show incompatibilities with Bazel's process wrapper.\r\n\r\n- **Native image builds will now respect Bazel flags like `--compilation_mode=opt`.**\r\n  Defaults have been left to GraalVM to maintain backward compatibility with the default case, which builds binaries with `-O2` (optimizations on). However, this is still a breaking change because the behavior will be different if `--compilation_mode` was being explicitly set to any value other than `opt`. Note that Bazel's default value of `fastbuild` also applies here, so passing _no value at all_ **will** result in a behavior change (`opt` → `fastbuild`).\r\n\r\n- **The order of options passed to `native-image` has changed.**\r\n  Attributes like `extra_args` now pass later on the command line (last, actually, for `extra_args`); because `native-image` options are last-wins, this should allow overriding _any_ of the flags injected by the rules. This should offer users a path forward even if the flags passed by the rules are incompatible in some way. This change in the order of action arguments may result in cache misses. Otherwise, this change should be transparent to rule users.\r\n\r\n- **Hermetic build environment improvements.**\r\n  The parameter `use_default_shell_env` is no longer passed to the underlying `native-image` compile action; instead, the toolchain environment is assembled for strict use. Native compiler environment variables like `INCLUDE`, `LIB`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and `SDKROOT` no longer need to be passed via `--action_env`.\r\n\r\n- **Toolchain targets and registration.**\r\n  See below for an exhaustive description, but basically, the registration calls for toolchains need to change, but only for users who are consuming via Bzlmod.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes: Toolchain registration\r\n\r\nWhen registering toolchains in a Bzlmod installation of these rules, the target `@graalvm//:all` must be changed to two toolchain registrations, based on the desired functionality:\r\n\r\n**Register the Java toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Register the GVM toolchain:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:toolchain_gvm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To keep the `:all` target:**\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm_toolchains//:all\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* docs: fix api docs and publish flow by @sgammon in

Summary\r\n\r\nInitial release of the new `rules_graalvm` package; this version was picked because the package internals are already considered mature. Under this rewrite, Bazel 7 is the new support maximum, so mostly we're adjusting to changes in Bazel. GraalVM distributions have also changed, so adjustments have been made to the way GVM installations are resolved and downloaded.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, `graalvm_repository` now uses the same internals as [`remote_java_repository`](https://bazel.build/docs/bazel-and-java#config-java-toolchains). This allows the downloaded JVM to be used easily as a Java toolchain, and explains to Bazel how to bootstrap the build with it.\r\n\r\nThe `latest` version of the `oracle` GVM distribution can also be downloaded now, and a user can provide their own `sha256` as well. See below for an exhaustive set of release notes and breaking changes from `rules_graal`.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n**Via `WORKSPACE.bazel`:**\r\n```starlark\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_graalvm\",\r\n    sha256 = \"96323ac1b7a5b9db1ae1a388c5ed1fb830d4628d3ab4b7f09538558321e03111\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_graalvm-0.9.0\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/releases/download/v0.9.0/rules_graalvm-0.9.0.tar.gz\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@rules_graalvm//graalvm:repositories.bzl\", \"graalvm_repository\")\r\n```\r\n```starlark\r\ngraalvm_repository(\r\n    name = \"graalvm\",\r\n    components = [\r\n       # if you need components like `js` or `wasm`, add them here\r\n    ],\r\n    distribution = \"oracle\",  # `oracle`, `ce`, or `community`\r\n    java_version = \"20\",  # `17`, `20`, or `21`, as supported by the version provided\r\n    version = \"20.0.2\",  # earlier version format like `22.x` also supported\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Or, via `MODULE.bazel`:**\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> To use Bzlmod with `rules_graalvm`, you will need the `archive_override` below (until this package is made available on BCR).\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_graalvm\", version = \"0.9.0\")\r\n```\r\n```starlark\r\n# Until we ship to BCR:\r\narchive_override(\r\n    module_name = \"rules_graalvm\",\r\n    urls = [\"https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/releases/download/v0.9.0/rules_graalvm-0.9.0.tar.gz\"],\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_graalvm-0.9.0\",\r\n    integrity = \"sha256-ljI6wbeludsa4aOIxe0fuDDUYo06tLfwlThVgyHgMRE=\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n```starlark\r\ngvm = use_extension(\"@rules_graalvm//:extensions.bzl\", \"graalvm\")\r\n\r\ngvm.graalvm(\r\n    name = \"graalvm\",\r\n    version = \"20.0.2\",  # earlier version format like `22.x` also supported\r\n    distribution = \"oracle\",  # `oracle`, `ce`, or `community`\r\n    java_version = \"20\",  # `17`, `20`, or `21`, as supported by the version provided\r\n    components = [\r\n       # if you need components like `js` or `wasm`, add them here\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\nuse_repo(\r\n    gvm,\r\n    \"graalvm\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using GraalVM as your Java toolchain\r\n\r\n**From `WORKSPACE.bazel`:**\r\n```starlark\r\n# graalvm_repository(...)\r\n```\r\n```starlark\r\nregister_toolchains(\"@graalvm//:toolchain\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**From `.bazelrc`:**\r\n```\r\nbuild --extra_toolchains=@graalvm//:toolchain\r\nbuild --java_runtime_version=graalvm_20\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> If you name your repository `example` and set the Java version to `21`, your `java_runtime_version` would be `example_21`.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n- Use GraalVM as your Java toolchain in Bazel\r\n- Conventional package structure\r\n- Support for Bazel 6, Bazel 7, and Bzlmod\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- `@rules_graal` →  `@rules_graalvm`\r\n- **Repository Rules**\r\n  - `load(\"@rules_graal//graal:graal_bindist.bzl\", \"graal_bindist_repository\")`\r\n    -  → `load(\"@rules_graalvm//graalvm:repositories.bzl\", \"graalvm_repository\")`\r\n  - `graal_bindist_repository` → `graalvm_repository`\r\n- **Target Rules**\r\n  - `load(\"@rules_graal//graal:graal.bzl\", \"graal_binary\")`\r\n    - → `load(\"@rules_graalvm//graalvm:defs.bzl\", \"native_image\")`\r\n  - `graal_binary` → `native_image`\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Update from upstream by @sgammon in https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/pull/2\r\n* Update from latest fork by @sgammon in https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/pull/4\r\n* Rewrite: `rules_graalvm` by @sgammon in https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/pull/5\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* No new contributors this round\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sgammon/rules_graalvm/commits/v0.9.0","mentions_count":1}]
