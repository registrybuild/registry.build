`v1.10.0` introduces major updates, integrating 600+ commits that significantly enhance its capabilities. This version brings multithreading support to the forefront, harnessing modern multi-core processors to accelerate both compression and decompression processing. It's a good upgrade for users looking to optimize performance in high-throughput environments.\r\n\r\n### Multithreading support\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade of this version is likely Multithreading support. While LZ4 has historically been recognized for its high-speed compression, the demand for even faster throughput has grown, particularly with the advent of `nvme` storage technologies that allow for multi-GB/s throughput.  \r\nMultithreading is particularly beneficial for High Compression modes, which now perform dramatically faster. The following benchmark table showcases the performance improvements:\r\n\r\nsource | cpu | os | level | v1.9.4 | v1.10.0 | Improvement |\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\nsilesia.tar | 7840HS | Win11 | 12 | 13.4 sec | 1.8 sec | x7.4\r\nsilesia.tar | M1 Pro | macos | 12 | 16.6 sec | 2.55 sec | x6.5\r\nsilesia.tar | i7-9700k | linux | 12 | 16.2 sec | 3.05 sec | x5.4\r\nenwik9 | 7840HS | Win11 | 9 | 20.8 sec | 2.6 sec | x8.0\r\nenwik9 | M1 Pro | macos | 9 | 22.1 sec | 2.95 sec | x7.4\r\nenwik9 | i7-9700k | linux | 9 | 22.9 sec | 4.05 sec | x5.7\r\n\r\nMultithreading is less critical for decompression, as modern `nvme` drives can still be saturated with a single decompression thread. Nonetheless, the new version enhances performance by overlapping I/O operations with decompression processes.\r\nTested on a x64 linux platform, decompressing a 5 GB text file locally takes 5 seconds with `v1.9.4`;\r\nthis is reduced to 3 seconds in `v1.10.0`, corresponding to > +60% performance improvement.\r\n\r\n### Official support for dictionary compression (and decompression)\r\n\r\nStarting from `v1.10.0`, dictionary compression, previously tagged as \"experimental\", now receives full support. This upgrade assures stability and ongoing support for the feature, enabling developers to reliably use this functionality in their applications.\r\nThe new symbols supported by `liblz4` are : \r\n- `LZ4_loadDictSlow()`: minor variant of `LZ4_loadDict()`, which consumes more initialization time to better reference the dictionary, resulting in slightly improved compression ratios.\r\n- `LZ4_attach_dictionary()`: use in-place a LZ4 state initialized with a dictionary, to perform dictionary compression (LZ4 Block format) without the initialization costs. Very useful for small data, where dictionary initialization can become a bottleneck. The dictionary state can be used by multiple threads concurrently. \r\n- `LZ4_attach_HC_dictionary()`: same as `LZ4_attach_dictionary()`, but for LZ4HC dictionary compression.\r\n- `LZ4F_compressBegin_usingDict()`: initiate streaming compression to the LZ4Frame format, using a Dictionary.\r\n- `LZ4F_decompress_usingDict()`: decompress a LZ4Frame requiring a Dictionary\r\n- `LZ4F_createCDict()` : create a materialized dictionary, ready to start compression without initialization cost. Can be shared across multiple threads.\r\n- `LZ4F_compressFrame_usingCDict()`: one-shot compression to the LZ4Frame format, using materialized `CDict`\r\n- `LZ4F_compressBegin_usingCDict()`: initiate streaming compression to the LZ4Frame format, using materialized `CDict`\r\n\r\n### New compression level 2\r\n\r\nThe new \"Level 2\" compression effectively fills the substantial gap between the standard \"Fast Level 1\" and the more intensive \"High Compression Level 3.\" It provides a balanced option, optimizing performance and compression as evidenced in the benchmark results below (i7-9700k, `linux`):\r\n\r\n| file             | level 1 | level 2 | level 3 |\r\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| silesia.tar (speed) | 685 MB/s | 315 MB/s | 110 MB/s |\r\n| silesia.tar (ratio) | x2.101  | x2.378  | x2.606  |\r\n\r\nLevel 2 is ideal for applications requiring better compression than `lz4` level 1, without the speed trade-offs associated with  HC level 3.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- The CLI now supports the environment variables `LZ4_CLEVEL` and `LZ4_NBWORKERS`, offering flexible control over its behavior in scenarios where direct commands are impractical, or when customized local defaults are necessary.\r\n- The licensing for the CLI and test programs has been clarified to `GPL-2.0-or-later` to distinguish it from `GPL-2.0-only`, enhancing transparency. The `liblz4` library maintains its BSD-2 clause license.\r\n- Various less common platforms have been validated (`loongArch`, `risc-v`, `m68k`, `mips` and `sparc`), and are now continuously tested in CI, to ensure portability.\r\n- Visual Studio solutions are now generated from `cmake` recipe, in an effort to reduce manual maintenance of multiple Solutions.\r\n\r\n### One-liner updates\r\n* cli  : multithreading compression support: improves speed by X times threads allocated\r\n* cli  : overlap decompression with i/o, improving speed by >+60%\r\n* cli  : support environment variables

`v1.9.4` is a maintenance release, featuring a substantial amount (~350 commits) of minor fixes and improvements, making it a recommended upgrade. The stable portion of `liblz4` API is unmodified, making this release a drop-in replacement for existing features.\r\n\r\n### Improved decompression speed\r\n\r\nPerformance wasn't a major focus of this release, but there are nonetheless a few improvements worth mentioning : \r\n- Decompression speed on high-end `ARM64` platform is improved, by ~+20%. This is notably the case for recent M1 chips, featured in macbook laptops and nucs. Some server-class ARM64 cpus are also impacted, most notably when employing `gcc` as a compiler. Due to the diversity of `aarch64` chips in service, it's still difficult to have a one-size-fits-all policy for this platform.\r\n- For the specific scenario of data compressed with `-BD4` setting (small blocks, <= 64 KB, linked) decompressed block-by-block into a flush buffer, decompression speed is improved ~+70%. This is most visible in the `lz4` CLI, which triggers this exact scenario, but since the improvement is achieved at library level, it may also apply to other scenarios.\r\n- Additionally, for compressed data employing the `lz4frame` format (native format of `lz4` CLI), it's possible to ignore checksum validation during decompression, resulting in speed improvements of ~+40% . This capability is exposed at both CLI (see `--no-crc`) and library levels.\r\n\r\n### New experimental library capabilities\r\n\r\nNew `liblz4` capabilities are provided in this version. They are considered experimental at this stage, and the most useful ones will be upgraded as candidate \"stable\" status in an upcoming release :\r\n- Ability to require `lz4frame` API to employ custom allocators for dynamic allocation.\r\n- Partial decompression of LZ4 blocks compressed with a dictionary, using `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial_usingDict()` by @yawqi\r\n- Create `lz4frame` blocks which are intentionally uncompressed, using `LZ4F_uncompressedUpdate()`, by @alexmohr\r\n- New API unit `lz4file`, abstracting File I/O operations for higher-level programs and libraries, by @anjiahao1\r\n- `liblz4` can be built for freestanding environments, using the new build macro `LZ4_FREESTANDING`, by @t-mat. In which case, it will not link to any standard library, disable all dynamic allocations, and rely on user-provided `memcpy()` and `memset()` operations.\t\r\n\t\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Fixed an annoying `Makefile` bug introduced in `v1.9.3`, in which `CFLAGS` was no longer respected when provided from environment variable. The root cause was an obscure bug in `make`, which has been fixed upstream following this bug report. There is no need to update `make` to build `liblz4` though, the `Makefile` has been modified to circumvent the issue and remains compatible with older versions of `make`.\r\n- `Makefile` is compatible with `-j` parallel run, including to run parallel tests (`make -j test`).\r\n- Documentation of LZ4 Block format has been updated, featuring notably a paragraph \"Implementation notes\", underlining common pitfalls for new implementers of the format\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes list\r\nHere is a more detailed list of updates introduced in `v1.9.4` :\r\n\r\n- perf : faster decoding speed (~+20%) on Apple Silicon platforms, by @zeux\r\n- perf : faster decoding speed (~+70%) for `-BD4` setting in CLI\r\n- api : new function `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial_usingDict()` by @yawqi\r\n- api : `lz4frame`: ability to provide custom allocators at state creation\r\n- api : can skip checksum validation for improved decoding speed\r\n- api : new experimental unit `lz4file` for file i/o API, by @anjiahao1\r\n- api : new experimental function `LZ4F_uncompressedUpdate()`, by @alexmohr\r\n- cli : `--list` works on `stdin` input, by @Low-power\r\n- cli : `--no-crc` does not produce (compression) nor check (decompression) checksums\r\n- cli : fix: `--test` and `--list` produce an error code when parsing invalid input\r\n- cli : fix: `--test -m` does no longer create decompressed file artifacts\r\n- cli : fix: support skippable frames when passed via `stdin`, reported by @davidmankin\r\n- build: fix: `Makefile` respects `CFLAGS` directives passed via environment variable\r\n- build: `LZ4_FREESTANDING`, new build macro for freestanding environments, by @t-mat\r\n- build: `make` and `make test` are compatible with `-j` parallel run\r\n- build: AS/400 compatibility, by @jonrumsey\r\n- build: Solaris 10 compatibility, by @pekdon\r\n- build: MSVC 2022 support, by @t-mat\r\n- build: improved meson script, by @eli-schwartz\r\n- doc : Updated LZ4 block format, provide an \"implementation notes\" section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @emaxerrno made their first contribution in https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/884\r\n* @servusdei2018 made their first

`v1.9.3` is a maintenance release, offering more than 200+ commits to fix multiple corner cases and build scenarios. Update is recommended. Existing `liblz4` API is not modified, so it should be a drop-in replacement.\r\n\r\n#### Faster Windows binaries\r\n\r\nOn the build side, multiple rounds of improvements, thanks to contributors such as @wolfpld and @remittor, make this version generate __faster binaries for Visual Studio__. It is also expected to better support a broader range of VS variants. \r\nSpeed benefits can be substantial. For example, on my laptop, compared with `v1.9.2`, this version built with VS2019 compresses at 640 MB/s (from 420 MB/s), and decompression reaches 3.75 GB/s (from 3.3 GB/s). So this is definitely perceptible.\r\n\r\n#### Other notable updates\r\n\r\nAmong the visible fixes, this version improves the `_destSize()` variant, an advanced API which reverses the logic by targeting an a-priori compressed size and trying to shove as much data as possible into the target budget. The high compression variant `LZ4_compress_HC_destSize()` would miss some important opportunities in highly compressible data, resulting in less than optimal compression (detected by @hsiangkao). This is fixed in this version. Even the \"fast\" variant receives some gains (albeit very small).\r\nAlso, the corresponding decompression function, `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial()`, officially supports a scenario where the input (compressed) size is unknown (but bounded), as long as the requested amount of data to regenerate is smaller or equal to the block's content. This function used to require the exact compressed size, and would sometimes support above scenario \"by accident\", but then could also break it by accident. This is now firmly controlled, documented and tested.\r\n\r\nFinally, replacing memory functions (`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`), typically for freestanding environments, is now a bit easier. It used to require a small direct modification of `lz4.c` source code, but can now be achieved by using the build macro `LZ4_USER_MEMORY_FUNCTIONS` at compilation time. In which case, `liblz4` no longer includes `<stdlib.h>`, and requires instead that functions `LZ4_malloc()`, `LZ4_calloc()` and `LZ4_free()` are implemented somewhere in the project, and then available at link time.\r\n\r\n### Changes list\r\nHere is a more detailed list of updates introduced in `v1.9.3` :\r\n\r\n- perf: highly improved speed in kernel space, by @terrelln\r\n- perf: faster speed with Visual Studio, thanks to @wolfpld and @remittor\r\n- perf: improved dictionary compression speed, by @felixhandte\r\n- perf: fixed `LZ4_compress_HC_destSize()` ratio, detected by @hsiangkao\r\n- perf: reduced stack usage in high compression mode, by @Yanpas\r\n- api : `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial()` supports unknown compressed size, requested by @jfkthame\r\n- api : improved `LZ4F_compressBound()` with automatic flushing, by Christopher Harvie\r\n- api : can (de)compress to/from NULL without UBs\r\n- api : fix alignment test on 32-bit systems (state initialization)\r\n- api : fix `LZ4_saveDictHC()` in corner case scenario, detected by @IgorKorkin\r\n- cli : compress multiple files using the legacy format, by Filipe Calasans\r\n- cli : benchmark mode supports dictionary, by @rkoradi\r\n- cli : fix `--fast` with large argument, detected by @picoHz\r\n- build: link to user-defined memory functions with `LZ4_USER_MEMORY_FUNCTIONS`\r\n- build: `contrib/cmake_unofficial/` moved to `build/cmake/`\r\n- build: `visual/*` moved to `build/`\r\n- build: updated meson script, by @neheb\r\n- build: tinycc support, by Anton Kochkov\r\n- install: Haiku support, by Jerome Duval\r\n- doc : updated LZ4 frame format, clarify EndMark\r\n\r\nKnown issues : \r\n- Some people have [reported a broken `liblz4_static.lib` file](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/issues/920) in the package `lz4_win64_v1_9_3.zip`. This is probably a `mingw` / `msvc` compatibility issue. If you have issues employing this file, the solution is to rebuild it locally from sources with your target compiler.\r\n- The standard `Makefile` in `v1.9.3` doesn't honor `CFLAGS` when passed through environment variable. This is fixed in more recent version on `dev` branch. See #958 for details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/33986291/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":11},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/19413762","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/19413762/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/19413762/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/tag/v1.9.2","id":19413762,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE5NDEzNzYy","tag_name":"v1.9.2","target_commitish":"fdf2ef5809ca875c454510610764d9125ef2ebbd","name":"LZ4 v1.9.2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-08-15T11:59:59Z","published_at":"2019-08-20T17:44:04Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/assets/14476917","id":14476917,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE0NDc2OTE3","name":"lz4_win32_v1_9_2.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":254555,"download_count":12658,"created_at":"2019-08-20T18:24:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T23:38:30Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/download/v1.9.2/lz4_win32_v1_9_2.zip"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/assets/14476898","id":14476898,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE0NDc2ODk4","name":"lz4_win64_v1_9_2.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":422132,"download_count":42543,"created_at":"2019-08-20T18:22:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T23:38:30Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/download/v1.9.2/lz4_win64_v1_9_2.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/tarball/v1.9.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/zipball/v1.9.2","body":"This is primarily a bugfix release, driven by the bugs found and fixed since  LZ4 recent integration into Google's `oss-fuzz`, initiated by @cmeister2 .

Upgrade to v1.9.1 is recommended.\r\n\r\nLZ4 v1.9.0 is a performance focused release, also offering minor API updates.\r\n\r\n### Decompression speed improvements\r\n\r\nDave Watson (@djwatson) managed to carefully optimize the LZ4 decompression hot loop, offering substantial speed improvements on x86 and x64 platforms.\r\n\r\nHere are some benchmark running on a Core i7-9700K, source compiled using `gcc v8.2.0` on Ubuntu 18.10 \"Cosmic Cuttlefish\" (`Linux 4.18.0-17-generic`) :\r\n\r\n| Version | v1.8.3 | v1.9.0 | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| enwik8      | 4090 MB/s | 4560 MB/s | +12% |\r\n| calgary.tar | 4320 MB/s | 4860 MB/s | +13% |\r\n| silesia.tar | 4210 MB/s | 4970 MB/s | +18% |\r\n\r\nGiven that decompression speed has always been a strong point of `lz4`, the improvement is quite substantial.\r\n\r\nThe new decoding loop is automatically enabled on x64 and x86. \r\nFor other cpu types, since our testing capabilities are more limited, the new decoding loop is disabled by default. However, anyone can manually enable it, by using the build macro `LZ4_FAST_DEC_LOOP`, which accepts values `0` or `1`. The outcome will vary depending on exact target and build chains. For example, in our limited tests with ARM platforms, we found that benefits vary strongly depending on cpu manufacturer, chip model, and compiler version, making it difficult to offer a \"generic\" statement. ARM situation may prove extreme though, due to the proliferation of variants available. Other cpu types may prove easier to assess.\r\n\r\n### API updates \r\n\r\n#### `_destSize()`\r\nThe `_destSize()` compression variants have been promoted to stable status.\r\nThese variants reverse the logic, by trying to fit as much input data as possible into a fixed memory budget. This is used for example in [WiredTiger]([http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/tune_page_size_and_comp.html](http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/tune_page_size_and_comp.html)) and [EroFS](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.19-EROFS-Staging), which cram as much data as possible into the size of a physical sector, for improved storage density.\r\n\r\n#### `reset*_fast()`\r\n\r\nWhen compressing small inputs, the fixed cost of clearing the compression's internal data structures can become a significant fraction of the compression cost. In `v1.8.2`, new LZ4 entry points have been introduced to perform this initialization at effectively zero cost. `LZ4_resetStream_fast()` and `LZ4_resetStreamHC_fast()` are now promoted into stable.\r\n\r\nThey are supplemented by new entry points, `LZ4_initStream()` and its corresponding `HC` variant, which must be used on any uninitialized memory segment that will be converted into an LZ4 state. After that, only `reset*_fast()` is needed to start some new compression job re-using the same context. This proves especially effective when compressing a lot of small data.\r\n\r\n#### deprecation\r\n\r\nThe `decompress*_fast()` variants have been moved into the deprecate section.\r\nWhile they offer slightly faster decompression speed (~+5%), they are also unprotected against malicious inputs, resulting in security liability. There are some limited cases where this property could prove acceptable (perfectly controlled environment, same producer / consumer), but in most cases, the risk is not worth the benefit. \r\nWe want to discourage such usage as clearly as possible, by pushing the `_fast()` variant into deprecation area.\r\nFor the time being, they will not yet generate deprecation warnings when invoked, to give time to existing applications to move towards `decompress*_safe()`. But this is the next stage, and is likely to happen in a future release.\r\n\r\n`LZ4_resetStream()` and `LZ4_resetStreamHC()` have also been moved into the deprecate section, to emphasize the preference towards `LZ4_resetStream_fast()`. Their real equivalent are actually `LZ4_initStream()` and `LZ4_initStreamHC()`, which are more generic (can accept any memory area to initialize) and safer (control size and alignment). Also, the naming makes it clearer when to use `initStream()` and when to use `resetStream_fast()`.\r\n\r\n   \r\n### Changes list\r\n\r\nThis release brings an assortment of small improvements and bug fixes, as detailed below :\r\n\r\n- perf: large decompression speed improvement on x86/x64 (up to +20%) by @djwatson\r\n- api : changed : `_destSize()` compression variants are promoted to stable API\r\n- api : new : `LZ4_initStream(HC)`, replacing `LZ4_resetStream(HC)`\r\n- api : changed : `LZ4_resetStream(HC)` as recommended reset function, for better performance on small data\r\n- cli : support custom block sizes, by @blezsan\r\n- build: source code can be amalgamated, by Bing Xu\r\n- build: added meson build, by @lzutao\r\n- build: new build macros : `LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX`, `LZ4_FAST_DEC_LOOP`\r\n- install: MidnightBSD, by @laffer1\r\n- install: msys2 on Windows 10, by @vtorri "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/12845527","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/12845527/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/12845527/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/tag/v1.8.3","id":12845527,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEyODQ1NTI3","tag_name":"v1.8.3","target_commitish":"641b453d9db536ee020851bfcb1dc39f61006f0a","name":"LZ4 v1.8.3 -

It also shows a new indicator, `cpu load %`, so that users can determine if the limiting factor was cpu or I/O bandwidth.\r\n\r\nFinally, an existing function, `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial()`, has been enhanced to make it possible to decompress only the beginning of an LZ4 block, up to a specified number of bytes.

In v1.8.2, this gets even better, as it improves decompression speed by about 10%, thanks in a large part to suggestion from @svpv .\r\n\r\nFor example, on a Mac OS-X laptop with an Intel Core i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz, \r\nrunning `lz4 -b`[`silesia.tar`](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia) compiled with default compiler `llvm v9.1.0`:\r\n\r\n| Version | v1.8.1 | v1.8.2 | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Decompression speed | 2490 MB/s | 2770 MB/s | +11% |\r\n\r\nCompression speeds also receive a welcomed boost, though improvement is not evenly distributed, with higher levels benefiting quite a lot more.\r\n\r\n| Version | v1.8.1 | v1.8.2 | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| lz4 -1 | 504 MB/s | 516 MB/s | +2% |\r\n| lz4 -9 | 23.2 MB/s| 25.6 MB/s| +10% |\r\n| lz4 -12|  3.5 Mb/s|  9.5 MB/s| +170% |\r\n\r\nShould you aim for best possible decompression speed, it's possible to request LZ4 to actively favor decompression speed, even if it means sacrificing some compression ratio in the process. This can be requested in a variety of ways depending on interface, such as using command `--favor-decSpeed` on CLI. This option must be combined with ultra compression mode (levels 10+), as it needs careful weighting of multiple solutions, which only this mode can process.\r\nThe resulting compressed object always decompresses faster, but is also larger. Your mileage will vary, depending on file content. Speed improvement can be as low as 1%, and as high as 40%. It's matched by a corresponding file size increase, which tends to be proportional. The general expectation is 10-20% faster  decompression speed for 1-2% bigger files.\r\n\r\n| Filename | decompression speed | `--favor-decSpeed` | Speed Improvement | Size change |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| silesia.tar | 2870 MB/s | 3070 MB/s | +7 % | +1.45% |\r\n| dickens | 2390 MB/s | 2450 MB/s | +2 % | +0.21% |\r\n| nci | 3740 MB/s | 4250 MB/s | +13 % | +1.93% |\r\n| osdb | 3140 MB/s | 4020 MB/s | +28 % | +4.04% |\r\n| xml | 3770 MB/s | 4380 MB/s | +16 % | +2.74% |\r\n\r\nFinally, variant `LZ4_compress_destSize()` also receives a ~10% speed boost, since it now internally redirects toward primary internal implementation of LZ4 fast mode, rather than relying on a separate custom implementation. This allows it to take advantage of all the optimization work that has gone into the main implementation.\r\n\r\n### Compressing small contents\r\n\r\nWhen compressing small inputs, the fixed cost of clearing the compression's internal data structures can  become a significant fraction of the compression cost. This release adds a new way, under certain conditions, to perform this initialization at effectively zero cost.\r\n\r\nNew, experimental LZ4 APIs have been introduced to take advantage of this functionality in block mode:\r\n\r\n-  `LZ4_resetStream_fast()`\r\n-  `LZ4_compress_fast_extState_fastReset()`\r\n-  `LZ4_resetStreamHC_fast()`\r\n-  `LZ4_compress_HC_extStateHC_fastReset()`\r\n\r\nMore detail about how and when to use these functions is provided in their respective headers.\r\n\r\nLZ4 Frame mode has been modified to use this faster reset whenever possible. `LZ4F_compressFrame_usingCDict()` prototype has been modified to additionally take an `LZ4F_CCtx*` context, so it can use this speed-up.\r\n    \r\n\r\n### Efficient Dictionary compression\r\n\r\nSupport for dictionaries has been improved in a similar way: they can now be used in-place, which avoids the expense of copying the context state from the dictionary into the working context. Users are expect to see a noticeable performance improvement for small data.\r\n\r\nExperimental prototypes (`LZ4_attach_dictionary()` and `LZ4_attach_HC_dictionary()`) have been added to LZ4 block API using a loaded dictionary in-place. LZ4 Frame API users should benefit from this optimization transparently. \r\n \r\nThe previous two changes, when taken advantage of, can provide meaningful performance improvements when compressing small data. Both changes have no impact on the produced compressed data. The only observable difference is speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Linux git compression ratio vs speed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lz4/lz4/v1.8.2/doc/images/usingCDict_1_8_2.png  \"Dictionary Compression Speed Improvements, levels 1 and 9\")\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is a representative graphic of the sort of speed boost to expect. The red lines are the speeds seen for an input blob of the specified size, using the previous LZ4 release (v1.8.1) at compression levels 1 and 9 (those being, fast mode and default HC level). The green lines are the equivalent observations for v1.8.2. This benchmark was performed on the [Silesia Corpus](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia). Results for the `dickens` text are shown, other texts and compression levels saw similar improvements. The benchmark was compiled with GCC 7.2.0 with `-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -DNDEBUG` under Linux 4.6 and run on an `Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz`.\r\n   \r\n\r\n### `lz4frame_static.h` Deprecation\r\n\r\nThe content of `lz4frame_static.h` has been folded into `lz4frame.h`, hidden by a macro guard \"`#ifdef LZ4F_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY`\". This means `lz4frame.h` now matches `lz4.h` and `lz4hc.h`. `lz4frame_static.h` is retained as a shell that simply sets the guard macro and includes `lz4frame.h`.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Changes list\r\n\r\nThis release also brings an assortment of small improvements and bug fixes, as detailed below :\r\n\r\n- perf: faster compression on small files, by @felixhandte\r\n- perf: improved decompression speed and binary size, by Alexey Tourbin (@svpv)\r\n- perf: faster HC compression, especially at max level\r\n- perf: very small compression ratio improvement\r\n- fix : compression

v1.8.1 most visible new feature is its support for __Dictionary compression__ .\r\nThis was already somewhat possible, but in a complex way, requiring knowledge of internal working.\r\nSupport is now more formally added on the API side within `lib/lz4frame_static.h`. It's early days, and this new API is tagged \"experimental\" for the time being.\r\n\r\nSupport is also added in the command line utility `lz4`, using the new command `-D`, implemented by @felixhandte. The behavior of this command is identical to [`zstd`](http://www.zstd.net), should you be already familiar.\r\n\r\n [`zstd`]: http://www.zstd.net\r\n \r\n`lz4` doesn't specify how to build a dictionary.  All it says is that it can be any file up to 64 KB.\r\nThis approach is compatible with [`zstd`] dictionary builder, which can be instructed to create a 64 KB dictionary with this command  : \r\n```\r\nzstd --train dirSamples/* -o dictName --maxdict=64KB\r\n```\r\n\r\nLZ4 v1.8.1 also offers improved performance at ultra settings (levels 10+).\r\nThese levels receive a new code, called optimal parser, available in `lib/lz4_opt.h`.\r\nCompared with previous version, the new parser uses less memory (from 384KB to 256KB), performs faster, compresses a little bit better (not much, as it was already close to theoretical limit), and resists pathological patterns which could destroy performance (see #339),\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here are some quick benchmark using LZ4 v1.8.0 on my laptop with `silesia.tar` :\r\n```\r\n./lz4 -b9e12 -v ~/dev/bench/silesia.tar\r\n*** LZ4 command line interface 64-bits v1.8.0, by Yann Collet ***\r\nBenchmarking levels from 9 to 12\r\n 9#silesia.tar

: 211984896 ->  77270146 (2.743),   3.7 MB/s ,2508.3 MB/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new parser is also directly compatible with lower compression levels, which brings additional benefits : \r\n- Compatibility with `LZ4_*_destSize()` variant, which reverses the logic by trying to fit as much data as possible into a predefined limited size buffer.\r\n- Compatibility with Dictionary compression, as it uses the same tables as regular HC mode\r\n\r\nIn the future, this compatibility will also allow dynamic on-the-fly change of compression level, but such feature is not implemented at this stage.\r\n\r\nThe release also provides a set of small bug fixes and improvements, listed below : \r\n- perf : faster and stronger ultra modes (levels 10+)\r\n- perf : slightly faster compression and decompression speed\r\n- perf : fix bad degenerative case, reported by @c-morgenstern\r\n- fix : decompression failed when using a combination of extDict + low memory address (#397), reported and fixed by Julian Scheid (@jscheid)\r\n- cli : support for dictionary compression (`-D`), by Felix Handte @felixhandte\r\n- cli : fix : `lz4 -d --rm` preserves timestamp (#441)\r\n- cli : fix : do not modify `/dev/null` permission as root, by @aliceatlas\r\n- api : new dictionary api in `lib/lz4frame_static.h`\r\n- api : `_destSize()` variant supported for all compression levels\r\n- build  : `make` and `make test` compatible with parallel build `-jX`, reported by @mwgamera\r\n- build  : can control `LZ4LIB_VISIBILITY` macro, by @mikir\r\n- install: fix man page directory (#387), reported by Stuart Cardall (@itoffshore)\r\n\r\nNote : `v1.8.1.2` is the same as `v.1.8.1`, with the version number fixed in source code, as notified by Po-Chuan Hsieh (@sunpoet)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/9220949","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/9220949/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/releases/9220949/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/tag/v1.8.1","id":9220949,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTkyMjA5NDk=","tag_name":"v1.8.1","target_commitish":"fb5e98a334d5538f4ffa70f5f51b8286531fe1ae","name":"LZ4
