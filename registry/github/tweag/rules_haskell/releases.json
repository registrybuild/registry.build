In the common case, users don't even need to run Stack to resolve a snapshot to a set of package tarballs. The tarballs can be cached in the Bazel repository cache. See [#1376](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1376).\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* The platform name for Nix users has changed.

See [#1280](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1280).\r\n* Use Stack >= 2.3.1 in the implementation of `stack_snapshot`. This enables better sdist caching, better performance, and makes `bazel fetch` more effective.\r\n* More aggressive shortening of library names to avoid exceeding MACH-O header size limits on macOS.\r\n* Make variables are now expanded in compiler and REPL flags.

It was\r\n  previously called `@io_tweag_rules_haskell`. It is now called\r\n  `@rules_haskell`. You should adapt your `WORKSPACE` file to match\r\n  this, as well as your `.bazelrc.local` file, if any.\r\n\r\n* `haskell_cabal_library`/`haskell_cabal_binary`: Both use `cabal` to\r\n  build Haskell package dependencies.\r\n\r\n* `stack_snapshot`: Uses stack’s dependency resolving algorithm to\r\n  generate `haskell_cabal_library` targets automatically.\r\n  Requires `stack` > 2.1, which it will download if cannot be found in\r\n  `PATH`.\r\n\r\n* It is now possible to statically link Haskell libraries in CC\r\n  binaries.\r\n\r\n* A new example has been added.\r\n\r\n  [**cat_hs:**](./examples/cat_hs/) is an example of a non-trivial application\r\n  with multiple third-party dependencies downloaded from Hackage,\r\n  C library dependencies and split up into multiple libraries and\r\n  a binary. We use a rule wrapping Cabal to build the Hackage\r\n  dependencies. This example requires Nix installed. It is used to\r\n  build (or download from a binary cache) the C library dependencies.\r\n\r\n* Improved coverage reports.\r\n\r\n* Haddock links to prebuilt libraries.\r\n\r\n* Various improvements to reduce header size limits and command line\r\n  argument length, in order to better support macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\n[bazel-rule-guidelines]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/deploying.html\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* `haskell_cabal_library`/`haskell_cabal_binary`.\r\n  See [#879](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/879),\r\n  [#898](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/898) and\r\n  [#904](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/904).\r\n* `stack_snapshot`.\r\n  See [#887](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/887) (name\r\n  changed to `stack_snapshot` after this PR).\r\n  See also [#1011](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1011).\r\n* `tools` arguments for stack and cabal rules.\r\n  See [#907](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/907).\r\n  They can be arbitrary tools,\r\n  see [#987](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/987).\r\n* `tools` attribute to core `haskell_*` rules. This attribute can be\r\n  used to expose GHC preprocessors.\r\n  See [#911](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/911).\r\n* Static GHC RTS can be specified in the toolchain.\r\n  See [#970](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/970).\r\n* `runfiles` library: manifest file support (for Windows).\r\n  See [#992](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/992).\r\n* Prototype implementation of bazel worker mode (not production-ready\r\n  yet).\r\n  See [#1024](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1024)\r\n  and [#1055](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1055)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* The `haskell_toolchain` macro now no longer adds a `toolchain`\r\n  definition. You must now define yourself a `haskell_toolchain` and\r\n  a `toolchain` separately. This should be a mostly transparent\r\n  change, because nearly no one uses these functions directly. They\r\n  are normally only used transitively via\r\n  `haskell_register_toolchains` and related functions.\r\n  See [#843](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/843).\r\n* The `haskell/haskell.bzl` entrypoint is deprecated. use\r\n  `haskell/defs.bzl` instead.\r\n* The `haskell_repositories()` macro is deprecated. Use\r\n  `rules_haskell_dependencies()` from `haskell/repositories.bzl`\r\n  instead.\r\n* The `haskell_register_toolchains()` macro is deprecated. Use\r\n  `rules_haskell_toolchains()` from `haskell/repositories.bzl`\r\n  instead.\r\n* The `exports` attribute’s semantics are changed:\r\n\r\n  ‘A list of other haskell libraries that will be transparently added\r\n  as a dependency to every downstream rule.’\r\n\r\n  The original `exports` is available under the new name\r\n  `reexported_modules`.\r\n  See [#1008](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1008).\r\n* `@` is allowed in Haskell binary names.\r\n* `haskell_library` may be empty (no files in `srcs`).\r\n  See [#1035](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1035).\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n* The `haskell_lint` rule has been removed. It should have been\r\n  designed as a test rule and it should have had a different name. The\r\n  rule isn't even necessary for its current purpose: it's more\r\n  convenient to turn on compiler warnings globally in the toolchain\r\n  definition.\r\n* The `cc_haskell_import` and `haskell_cc_import` rules have been removed.\r\n  These rules were redundant since Haskell rules can directly interact with C\r\n  rules. Use the following patterns instead.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  # To import Haskell from C.\r\n  haskell_library(name = \"haskell-lib\", ...)\r\n  cc_library(name = \"cc-lib\", deps = [\":haskell-lib\"], ...)\r\n\r\n  # To import C from Haskell.\r\n  cc_library(name = \"cc-lib\", ...)\r\n  haskell_library(name = \"haskell-lib\", deps = [\":cc-lib\"], ...)\r\n\r\n  # To import a pre-built library.\r\n  cc_library(name = \"so-lib\", srcs = glob([\"libxyz.so*\", \"libxyz.dylib\", \"libxyz.a\", \"libxyz.dll\"]))\r\n  haskell_library(name = \"haskell-lib\", deps = [\":so-lib\"], ...)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n* `haskell_register_ghc_nixpkgs`: Forward all arguments to wrapped\r\n  rules. See [#886](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/886).\r\n  Also support `repository` argument and `nixopts`.\r\n* Haddock links to prebuilt libraries.\r\n  See [#928](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/928)\r\n  and [#934](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/934).\r\n* Documentation for GHC plugin targets is now included in\r\n  the API documentation.\r\n* The Multi-REPL recognizes `haskell_toolchain_library` dependencies.\r\n* Various imrovements to linking. See\r\n  [#930](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/930).\r\n* `$(location)` expansion for “expression is not a declared\r\n  prerequisite of this rule”.\r\n  See [#990](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/990).\r\n* Better error if the compiler version doesn’t match the one specified\r\n  in the toolchain.\r\n  See [#1014](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1014).\r\n* macOS bindists correctly find `ar` and `sed` invocation was broken.\r\n  See [#1022](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1022)\r\n  and [#1017](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1017).\r\n* Allow arbitrary name for `haskell_cabal_library`. See\r\n  [#1034](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1034).\r\n* Various fixes for `c2hs` on Windows\r\n  See [#1046](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1046)\r\n  and [#1052](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1052).\r\n* `:load` command in `ghci`\r\n  See [#1046](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/1046).\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n\r\n* Profiling mode (`--compilation_mode=\"dbg\"`).\r\n  See [#896](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/896).\r\n* GHC errors won’t be swallowed anymore.\r\n  See

Highlights\r\n\r\n* The minimum supported Bazel version is now v0.24.\r\n\r\n  The version is available from [`nixpkgs\r\n  unstable`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/58147) and via\r\n  [`official\r\n  releases`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).\r\n\r\n* Initial Windows support\r\n\r\n  A non-trivial subset of `rules_haskell` is now working on Windows.\r\n  See the [`project\r\n  tracker`](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Atweag%2Frules_haskell%2F2)\r\n  for finished and ongoing work.\r\n\r\n* Improved OSX support\r\n\r\n  Due to the `mach-o` header size limit, we took extra measures to\r\n  make sure generated library paths are as short as possible, so\r\n  linking haskell binaries works even for large dependency graphs.\r\n\r\n* Better Bindist support\r\n\r\n  The default [`start` script](http://haskell.build/start) sets up a\r\n  bindist-based project by default.\r\n\r\n  `rules_nixpkgs` is no longer a required dependency of\r\n  `rules_haskell` (but can still be used as backend).\r\n\r\n* Full Haskell–C–Haskell Sandwich\r\n\r\n  A `haskell_library` can be now be used nearly anywhere a\r\n  `cc_library` can.\r\n\r\n  The old `cc_haskell_import` and `haskell_cc_import` wrapper rules\r\n  are no longer necessary and have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n* Greatly improved REPL support\r\n\r\n  A new `haskell_repl` rule allows to load multiple source targets by\r\n  source, or compiled, as needed. Example usage:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  haskell_repl(\r\n    name = \"my-repl\",\r\n    # Collect all transitive Haskell dependencies from these targets.\r\n    deps = [\r\n        \"//package-a:target-1\",\r\n        \"//package-b:target-2\",\r\n    ],\r\n    # Load targets by source that match these patterns.\r\n    include = [\r\n        \"//package-a/...\",\r\n        \"//packaga-b/...\",\r\n        \"//common/...\",\r\n    ],\r\n    # Don't load targets by source that match these patterns.\r\n    exclude = [\r\n        \"//package-a/vendored/...\",\r\n    ],\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Support for GHC plugins\r\n\r\n  Each `haskell_*` rule now has a `plugins` attribute. It takes a\r\n  list of bazel targets, which should be `haskell_library`s that\r\n  implement the [GHC plugin\r\n  specification](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#compiler-plugins).\r\n\r\n* Initial Code Coverage support\r\n\r\n  Measure coverage of your Haskell code. See the [“Checking Code\r\n  Coverage”](https://rules-haskell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/haskell-use-cases.html#checking-code-coverage)\r\n  section in the manual.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Notice\r\n\r\n[`hazel`](https://github.com/FormationAI/hazel) was [merged into\r\n`rules_haskell`](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/733), but\r\nwe are not yet certain about the exact interface we want to expose.\r\n`hazel` is therefore not included in this release, and we can’t\r\nguarantee the original, unmerged version is compatible with this\r\nrelease. If you depend on `hazel`, please use a recent `master` commit\r\nof `rules_haskell`.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* `haskell_register_ghc_bindists` is no longer re-exported from\r\n  `//haskell/haskell.bzl`.\r\n  You must now load that macro from `//haskell:nixpkgs.bzl`.\r\n\r\n* `rules_nixpkgs` is no longer a dependency of `rules_haskell`.\r\n\r\n* `haskell_import` has been renamed to `haskell_toolchain_library`.\r\n  This is a substantial breaking change. But adapting to it should be\r\n  as simple as\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  sed -i 's/^haskell_import/haskell_toolchain_library/' **/BUILD{,.bazel}\r\n  sed -i 's/\"haskell_import\"/\"haskell_toolchain_library\"/' **/BUILD{,.bazel}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  See [#843](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/843).\r\n\r\n* `haskell_toolchain`’s tools attribute is now a list of labels.\r\n  Earlier entries take precendence. To migrate, add `[]` around your\r\n  argument.\r\n  See [#854](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/854).\r\n\r\n* The default outputs of `haskell_library` are now the static and/or\r\n  shared library files, not the package database config and cache\r\n  files.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* `haskell_repl` rule that constructs a ghci wrapper that loads\r\n  multiple targets by source.\r\n  See [#736](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/736).\r\n* `plugins` attribute to `haskell_*` rules to load GHC plugins.\r\n  See [#799](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/799).\r\n* The `HaskellInfo` and `HaskellLibraryInfo` providers are now\r\n  exported and thus accessible by downstream rules.\r\n  See [#844](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/844).\r\n* Generate version macros for preprocessors (`c2hs`, `hsc2hs`).\r\n  See [#847](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/847).\r\n* `bindist_toolchain` rule gets `haddock_flags` and `repl_ghci_args`\r\n  attributes.\r\n* `@repl` targets write json file with build information, usable by\r\n  IDE tools.\r\n  See [#695](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/695).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n\r\n* `haskell_cc_import`; use `cc_library` instead.\r\n  See [#831](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/831).\r\n* `cc_haskell_import`; just use `haskell_library` like a `cc_library`.\r\n  See [#831](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/831).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n* Support protobuf roots in `haskell_proto_library`.\r\n  See [#722](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/722).\r\n* Made GHC bindist relocatable on *nix.\r\n  See [#853](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/853).\r\n* Various other fixes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_haskell/releases/15234677","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_haskell/releases/15234677/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_haskell/releases/15234677/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/releases/tag/v0.8","id":15234677,"author":{"login":"Profpatsch","id":3153638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTM2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3153638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch","html_url":"https://github.com/Profpatsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Profpatsch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE1MjM0Njc3","tag_name":"v0.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release 0.8","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-01-29T09:26:25Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T09:29:07Z","published_at":"2019-01-29T09:29:07Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_haskell/tarball/v0.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_haskell/zipball/v0.8","body":"## [0.8] - 2019-01-28\r\n\r\n* The minimum supported Bazel version is now v0.21.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* `haskell_register_toolchains`, `haskell_register_ghc_bindists` and\r\n  `haskell_register_ghc_nixpkgs` to register multiple toolchains for\r\n  multiple platforms at once.

See [#231](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/231).\r\n\r\n* Generated source files do not cause issues now. See\r\n  [#211](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/211).\r\n\r\n* `data` attributes now allow files in them. See\r\n  [#236](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/236).\r\n\r\n* Bug when headers and hsc2hs-produced files were not visible to Haddock.\r\n  See [#254](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/254).\r\n\r\n* Bug preventing using genrule-produced headers via `haskell_cc_import`. See\r\n  [#268](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/268).\r\n\r\n* Bug that allowed us avoid specifying certain `prebuilt_dependencies` if\r\n  they were already specified for transitive dependencies. See\r\n  [#286](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/286).\r\n\r\n* Bug that was making modules generated from `.hsc` and `.chs` files and\r\n  generated modules in general not available in the REPLs. See\r\n  [#323](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/323).\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* Added `-Wnoncanonical-monad-instances` to default warnings in\r\n  `haskell_lint`.\r\n\r\n* How REPLs work. Now there is an optional output per binary/library. Its\r\n  name is the name of target with `-repl` added. Users can then build and\r\n  run such a REPL for any defined target. See\r\n  [#220](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/220) and\r\n  [#225](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/225).\r\n\r\n* The `haskell_doc` rule now produces self-contained documentation bundle\r\n  with unified index. See\r\n  [#249](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/249).\r\n\r\n* `haskell_lint` now only lints direct dependencies. See\r\n  [#293](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/293).\r\n\r\n* `haskell_doctest` has been re-designed. It's now a normal rule that works\r\n  only on direct dependencies and allows to specify modules which should be\r\n  tested, pass custom flags to `doctest` executable. See\r\n  [#342](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/342).\r\n\r\n* The `prebuilt_dependencies` attribute of `haskell_binary` and\r\n  `haskell_library` has been deprecated.
