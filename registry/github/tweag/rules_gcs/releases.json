A full example is provided [here](https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/tree/v1.0.1/examples/bazel_5).\r\n\r\n## Credential Helper Diversity\r\n`rules_gcs` ships with a simple credential helper out of the box. Meanwhile, Tweag has released [tweag-credential-helper](https://github.com/tweag/credential-helper) as a fully fledged authentication provider with caching and support for many services built-in.\r\nWe recommend using a dedicated credential helper for performance reasons.\r\n\r\n## Lockfile JSONPath\r\n\r\nThe lockfile consumed by `gcs_bucket.from_file` can now be part of a larger JSON document. The optional attribute `lockfile_jsonpath` can be used to specify a part of a JSON file to be used instead.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* test on Bazel 8 by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/2\r\n* examples: add an example with a real credential helper by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/3\r\n* tweag-credential-helper example: remove unused deps by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/4\r\n* ci: switch Google workload identity provider by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/5\r\n* use child object of json lockfile if JSONPath is given by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/7\r\n* Basic Bazel 5 support (and earlier) by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/9\r\n* prepare v1.0.1 by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/10\r\n* docs: update to add `lockfile_jsonpath` attribute by @malt3 in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/11\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @malt3 made their first contribution in https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/pull/2\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/179069425","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/179069425/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/179069425/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/tag/v1.0.0","id":179069425,"author":{"login":"malt3","id":1780588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODA1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3","html_url":"https://github.com/malt3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOMmwly84KrGHx","tag_name":"v1.0.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"v1.0.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-10-09T09:32:36Z","published_at":"2024-10-09T09:52:44Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/assets/197881267","id":197881267,"node_id":"RA_kwDOMmwly84Ly22z","name":"rules_gcs-v1.0.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"malt3","id":1780588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODA1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3","html_url":"https://github.com/malt3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malt3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":24315,"digest":null,"download_count":17499,"created_at":"2024-10-09T09:52:37Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T09:52:38Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/tweag/rules_gcs/releases/download/v1.0.0/rules_gcs-v1.0.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/tarball/v1.0.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tweag/rules_gcs/zipball/v1.0.0","body":""}]
