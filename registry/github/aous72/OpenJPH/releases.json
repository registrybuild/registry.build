Adding support for NLT marker segment of type 3.\r\n\r\nThe code is not very complete, but it is in a useful state for publishing.\r\n\r\nTo make use of the NLT marker segment for type 3, partial support for the .pfm file format has been added.\r\nFor .pfm files, lossy compression is not supported -- it is possible to add support at some future point.\r\nReversible coding of .pfm files is supported, where the NLT marker is automatically inserted.\r\nThe current implementation supports no less than 27 bit for encoding and 26 bits decoding; you can get more precision if you disable colour transform (1 bit) and use no more than 5 levels of decomposition (1 bit). If more than that is required, a complete new path must be developed that uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers; this requires changes to all arithmetic and also changes to the block encoder and decoder.\r\nTherefore floating point values stored in a .pfm file, which are 32-bit, need to be truncated.\r\nUsing the '-bit_depth' option, ojph_compress can perform this truncation.\r\n'ojph_compress' should work correctly with codestreams generated with ojph_compress, converting truncated values back to normal floating point values.\r\n\r\nAll other features should be working.\r\n### Importantly, the code also fixes an important bug in the _block decoder_ in commit https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/pull/154/commits/9f8011ce790b1d014ebcd7e0a6842730bf14e739\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Adding support for NLT marker segment of type 3 by @aous72 in https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/pull/154\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/compare/0.16.0...0.17.0","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/174035836","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/174035836/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/174035836/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/tag/0.16.0","id":174035836,"author":{"login":"aous72","id":7401883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDE4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7401883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH_HI84KX5N8","tag_name":"0.16.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.16.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-09-09T00:25:26Z","published_at":"2024-09-09T00:31:04Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/tarball/0.16.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/zipball/0.16.0","body":"This is an important addition by Tomasz @tszumski.

Removing an option can be due to that it is missing from the compiler, or to reduce the resulting code size.\r\nNotice that all instructions are enabled by default and need to be disabled if desired,\r\nWe add better support for ARM -- No NEON code yet.\r\nAlso added more Actions.\r\n\r\nThis should address issues https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/issues/111 and https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/issues/121.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Better arm support by @aous72 in https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/pull/139\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/compare/0.12.0...0.13.0","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/153390781","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/153390781/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/153390781/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/tag/0.12.0","id":153390781,"author":{"login":"aous72","id":7401883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDE4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7401883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH_HI84JJI69","tag_name":"0.12.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Adding a simple RTP client that is compliant with draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-j2k-scl-00","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-04-30T02:19:22Z","published_at":"2024-04-30T02:21:25Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/tarball/0.12.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/zipball/0.12.0","body":"Recently, there have been activities around using HTJ2K for low-latency media delivery -- some of these activities are related to my PhD, and therefore is close to my heart.\r\n\r\nThe pull request adds a new executable, ojph_stream_expand.\r\nojph_stream_expand is compliant with the draft proposal of [IETF RTP Payload Format for sub-codestream latency JPEG 2000 streaming](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-j2k-scl/00/), but it is by no means a complete implementation.\r\nojph_stream_expand enables testing with a source that produces such a stream.\r\n\r\nojph_stream_expand receives RTP packets and can optionally store them into .j2c files.\r\nIn its current phase, it does not expand images nor display them, despite what the name suggests.\r\nThe name is chosen to correspond to Kakadu's kdu_stream_expand, and in fact ojph_stream_expand has been tested to work with kdu_stream_send.\r\n\r\nThe executable is currently hidden, as I do not think many people would be interested.

release focuses primarily on improving the speed of the decoder.  \r\nThis is an improvement of between 30-50% in decode time, or 40-80% in throughput.\r\nA lot has changed in certain places.\r\n- Large parts of the block decoder has been rewritten.\r\n- SSSE3 optimized version of the block decoder has been written.\r\n- Accelerated functions that transfer from and to the block decoder has been added, as suggested by [Chris](https://github.com/chafey).\r\n- Accelerated functions that write to pgm and ppm; the code can be used for other file types, but I was too tired to include this as well.  This was suggest by [Mike](https://github.com/michaeldsmith).\r\n- Slightly modified the internal structure of buffers returned when codestream::pull is invoked; this allows buffers from different components to coexist (can be used concurrently).  This is needed for the accelerated functions above.  Previous designs using this feature should continue working without issues.\r\n- For WASM, we have now accelerated all the decode path including the block decoder using SIMD instructions.\r\n- A bug fix for an issue reported by [Pierre](https://github.com/palemieux), where an empty subband can cause a segmentation fault.\r\n- For windows, added a flag for disable exported functions when static build is used, as suggested by [Lucas](https://github.com/Jamaika1).\r\n- There might be other issues that I forgot.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/67796314/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/63817817","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/63817817/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/63817817/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/releases/tag/0.8.3","id":63817817,"author":{"login":"aous72","id":7401883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDE4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7401883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72","html_url":"https://github.com/aous72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aous72/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH_HI84DzchZ","tag_name":"0.8.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.8.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-04-07T02:26:42Z","published_at":"2022-04-07T02:35:54Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/tarball/0.8.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aous72/OpenJPH/zipball/0.8.3","body":"This
