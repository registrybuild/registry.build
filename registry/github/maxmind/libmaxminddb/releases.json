Among these fixes is improved validation of the database metadata. Unfortunately, MaxMind GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases created earlier than January 28, 2014 had an invalid data type for the record_size in the metadata. Previously these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database\n- Added pkg-config support. If your system supports it, then running `make\n  install` now installs a `libmaxminddb.pc` file for pkgconfig. Implemented by\n  Jan Vcelak.\n- Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These were\n  caused by missing bounds checking and missing verification of data type.\n- `MMDB_get_entry_data_list` will now fail on data structures with a depth\n  greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This should not\n  affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases produced by\n  MaxMind have a depth of less than

Previously, when there was an error in `MMDB_open()`, `errno` would\n  generally be overwritten during cleanup, preventing a useful value from\n  being returned to the caller. This was changed so that the `errno` value\n  from the function call that caused the error is restored before returning to\n  the caller. In particular, this is important for `MMDB_IO_ERROR` errors as\n  checking `errno` is often the only way to determine what actually failed.\n- If `mmap()` fails due to running out of memory space, an\n  `MMDB_OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR` is now returned from `MMDB_open` rather than an\n  `MMDB_IO_ERROR`.\n- On Windows, the `CreateFileMappingA()` handle was not properly closed if\n  opening the database succeeded. Fixed by Bly Hostetler. GitHub #75 & #76.\n- On Windows, we were not checking the return value of `CreateFileMappingA()`\n  properly for errors. Fixed by Bly Hotetler. GitHub #78.\n- Several warnings from Clang's scan-build were fixed. GitHub #86.\n- All headers are now installed in `$(includedir)`. GitHub #89.\n- We no longer install `maxminddb-compat-util.h`.
