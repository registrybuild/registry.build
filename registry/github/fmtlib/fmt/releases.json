It allows formatting an error message as a string. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto ec = std::make_error_code(std::errc::no_such_file_or_directory);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:s}\\n\", ec);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  prints\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  No such file or directory\r\n  ```\r\n  (The actual message is platform-specific.)\r\n\r\n- Fixed formatting of `std::chrono::local_time` and `tm` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3815, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4350).

This brings the compile time of code using {fmt} much closer to the equivalent `printf` code as shown on the following benchmark that compiles 100 source files:\r\n\r\n  | Method       | Compile Time (s) |\r\n  |--------------|------------------|\r\n  | printf       | 1.6              |\r\n  | IOStreams    | 25.9             |\r\n  | fmt 10.x     | 19.0             |\r\n  | fmt 11.0     | 4.8              |\r\n  | tinyformat   | 29.1             |\r\n  | Boost Format | 55.0             |\r\n\r\n  This gives almost 4x improvement in build speed compared to version 10. Note that the benchmark is purely formatting code and includes. In real projects the difference from `printf` will be smaller partly because common standard headers will be included in almost any translation unit (TU) anyway. In particular, in every case except `printf` above ~1s is spent in total on including `<type_traits>` in all TUs.\r\n\r\n- Optimized includes in other headers such as `fmt/format.h` which is now roughly equivalent to the old `fmt/core.h` in terms of build speed.\r\n\r\n- Migrated the documentation at https://fmt.dev/ from Sphinx to MkDocs.\r\n\r\n- Improved C++20 module support (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3990, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3991, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3993, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3994, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3997, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3998, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4004, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4005, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4006, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4013, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4027, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4029). In particular, native CMake support for modules is now used if available. Thanks @yujincheng08 and @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Added an option to replace standard includes with `import std` enabled via the `FMT_IMPORT_STD` macro (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3921, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3928). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Exported `fmt::range_format`, `fmt::range_format_kind` and `fmt::compiled_string` from the `fmt` module (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3970, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3999). Thanks @matt77hias and @yujincheng08.\r\n\r\n- Improved integration with stdio in `fmt::print`, enabling direct writes into a C stream buffer in common cases. This may give significant performance improvements ranging from tens of percent to [2x]( https://stackoverflow.com/a/78457454/471164) and eliminates dynamic memory allocations on the buffer level. It is currently enabled for built-in and string types with wider availability coming up in future releases.\r\n\r\n  For example, it gives ~24% improvement on a [simple benchmark]( https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3107R5.html#perf) compiled with Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5) and run on macOS 14.2.1:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Benchmark             Time             CPU   Iterations\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  printf             81.8 ns         81.5 ns      8496899\r\n  fmt::print (10.x)  63.8 ns         61.9 ns     11524151\r\n  fmt::print (11.0)  51.3 ns         51.0 ns     13846580\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Improved safety of `fmt::format_to` when writing to an array (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3805). For example ([godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/cYrn8dWY8)):\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  auto volkswagen = char[4];\r\n  auto result = fmt::format_to(volkswagen, \"elephant\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  no longer results in a buffer overflow. Instead the output will be truncated and you can get the end iterator and whether truncation occurred from the `result` object. Thanks @ThePhD.\r\n\r\n- Enabled Unicode support by default in MSVC, bringing it on par with other compilers and making it unnecessary for users to enable it explicitly. Most of {fmt} is encoding-agnostic but this prevents mojibake in places where encoding matters such as path formatting and terminal output. You can control the Unicode support via the CMake `FMT_UNICODE` option. Note that some {fmt} packages such as the one in vcpkg have already been compiled with Unicode enabled.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::expected` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3834). Thanks @dominicpoeschko.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::complex` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1467, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3886, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3892, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3900). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::type_info` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3978). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Specialized `formatter` for `std::basic_string` types with custom traits and allocators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3938, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3943). Thanks @dieram3.\r\n\r\n- Added formatters for `std::chrono::day`, `std::chrono::month`, `std::chrono::year` and `std::chrono::year_month_day` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3758, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3772, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3906, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3913). For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n\r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::green), \"{}\\n\", std::chrono::day(7));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  prints a green day:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"306\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/assets/576385/6e395f8b-451a-4cf7-bccc-ee92ca0dec65\">\r\n\r\n  Thanks @zivshek.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of precision in `%S` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3794, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3814). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n- Added support for the `-` specifier (glibc `strftime` extension) to day of the month (`%d`) and week of the year (`%W`, `%U`, `%V`) specifiers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3976). Thanks @ZaheenJ.\r\n\r\n- Fixed the scope of the `-` extension in chrono formatting so that it doesn't apply to subsequent specifiers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3811, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3812). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Improved handling of `time_point::min()` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3282).\r\n\r\n- Added support for character range formatting (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3857, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3863). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n- Added `string` and `debug_string` range formatters (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3973, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4024).

Thanks @bbolli.\r\n\r\n- Made contiguous iterator optimizations apply to `std::basic_string` iterators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3798). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Added support for ranges with mutable `begin` and `end` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3752, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3800, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3955). Thanks @tcbrindle and @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Added support for move-only iterators to `fmt::join` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3802, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3946). Thanks @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Moved range and iterator overloads of `fmt::join` to `fmt/ranges.h`, next to other overloads.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of types with `begin` returning `void` such as Eigen matrices (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3839, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3964). Thanks @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Added an `fmt::formattable` concept (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3974). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Added support for `__float128` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3494).\r\n\r\n- Fixed rounding issues when formatting `long double` with fixed precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3539).\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::isnan` not trigger floating-point exception for NaN values (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3948, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3951). Thanks @alexdewar.\r\n\r\n- Removed dependency on `<memory>` for `std::allocator_traits` when possible (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3804).

Thanks @yujincheng08.\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::iterator_buffer`'s move constructor `noexcept` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3808). Thanks @waywardmonkeys.\r\n\r\n- Started enforcing that `formatter::format` is const for compatibility with `std::format` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3447).\r\n\r\n- Added `fmt::basic_format_arg::visit` and deprecated `fmt::visit_format_arg`.\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::basic_string_view` not constructible from `nullptr` for consistency with `std::string_view` in C++23 (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3846). Thanks @dalle.\r\n\r\n- Fixed `fmt::group_digits` for negative integers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3891, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3901). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of negative ids in `fmt::basic_format_args::get` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3945).

Thanks @intelfx.\r\n\r\n-   Added support for the chrono suffix for days and changed the suffix for minutes from \"m\" to the correct \"min\" (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3662, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3664). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/9KhMnq9ba)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::chrono::days(42)); // prints \"42d\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @Richardk2n.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an overflow in `std::chrono::time_point` formatting with large dates (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3727).

Thanks @tchaikov.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed formatting of invalid UTF-8 with precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3284).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an inconsistency between `fmt::to_string` and `fmt::format` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3684).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed unsafe uses of `fmt::styled` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3625):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto s = fmt::styled(std::string(\"dangle\"), fmt::emphasis::bold);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", s); // compile error\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Pass `fmt::styled(...)` as a parameter instead.\r\n\r\n-   Added a null check when formatting a C string with the `s` specifier (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3706).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed the `c` specifier for `bool` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3726, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3734). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Made the default formatting unlocalized in `fmt::ostream_formatter` for consistency with the rest of the library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3460).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed localized formatting in bases other than decimal (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3693, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3750). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed a performance regression in experimental `fmt::ostream::print` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3674).\r\n\r\n-   Added synchronization with the underlying output stream when writing to the Windows console (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3668, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3688, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3689).

Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Made `fmt::streamed` `constexpr`. (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3650). Thanks @muggenhor.\r\n\r\n-   Enabled `consteval` on older versions of MSVC (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3757). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Added an option to build without `wchar_t` support on Windows (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3631, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3636).

\r\n  \r\n  Replaced Grisu with a new floating-point formatting algorithm for given precision (#3262, #2750, #3269, #3276).

\r\n  \r\n  Switched to the internal floating point formatter for all decimal presentation formats. In particular this results in consistent rounding on all platforms and removing the `s[n]printf` fallback for decimal FP formatting.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Compile-time floating point formatting no longer requires the header-only mode. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/G37PTeG3b)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <array>\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  consteval auto compile_time_dtoa(double value) -> std::array<char, 10> {\r\n    auto result = std::array<char, 10>();\r\n    fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), value);\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  constexpr auto answer = compile_time_dtoa(0.42);\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  works with the default settings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved the implementation of [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox), the algorithm used for the default floating-point formatting (#2713, #2750). Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::to_string` work with `__float128`. This uses the internal FP formatter and works even on system without `__float128` support in `[s]printf`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Disabled automatic `std::ostream` insertion operator (`operator<<`) discovery when `fmt/ostream.h` is included to prevent ODR violations. You can get the old behavior by defining `FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM` but this will be removed in the next major release. Use `fmt::streamed` or `fmt::ostream_formatter` to enable formatting via `std::ostream` instead.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::ostream_formatter` that can be used to write `formatter` specializations that perform formatting via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5sEc5qMsf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  struct date {\r\n    int year, month, day;\r\n  \r\n    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const date& d) {\r\n      return os << d.year << '-' << d.month << '-' << d.day;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  template <> struct fmt::formatter<date> : ostream_formatter {};\r\n  \r\n  std::string s = fmt::format(\"The date is {}\", date{2012, 12, 9});\r\n  // s == \"The date is 2012-12-9\"\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added the `fmt::streamed` function that takes an object and formats it via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5G3346G1f)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\",\r\n               fmt::streamed(std::this_thread::get_id()));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Note that `fmt/std.h` provides a `formatter` specialization for `std::thread::id` so you don't need to format it via `std::ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Deprecated implicit conversions of unscoped enums to integers for consistency with scoped enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added an argument-dependent lookup based `format_as` extension API to simplify formatting of enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::variant` formatting support (#2941). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/KG9z6cq68)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <variant>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto v = std::variant<int, std::string>(42);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", v);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  variant(42)\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@jehelset](https://github.com/jehelset).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::filesystem::path` formatting support (#2865, #2902, #2917, #2918). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/o44dMexEb)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <filesystem>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"There is no place like {}.\", std::filesystem::path(\"/home\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  There is no place like \"/home\".\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added a `std::thread::id` formatter to `fmt/std.h`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/j1azbYf3E)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\", std::this_thread::get_id());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::styled` that applies a text style to an individual argument (#2793). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/vWGW7v5M6)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n    fmt::print(\r\n      \"[{}] {}: {}\\n\",\r\n      fmt::styled(now, fmt::emphasis::bold),\r\n      fmt::styled(\"error\", fg(fmt::color::red)),\r\n      \"something went wrong\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/175071215-12809244-dab0-4005-96d8-7cd911c964d5.png)\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo)](https://github.com/rbrugo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::print` overload for text styles correctly handle UTF-8 (#2681, #2701). Thanks [@AlexGuteniev (Alex Guteniev)](https://github.com/AlexGuteniev).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed Unicode handling when writing to an ostream.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for nested specifiers to range formatting (#2673). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/xd3Gj38cf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <vector>\r\n  #include <fmt/ranges.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{::#x}\\n\", std::vector{10, 20, 30});\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints `[0xa, 0x14, 0x1e]`.\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Implemented escaping of wide strings in ranges (#2904). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for ranges with `begin` / `end` found via the argument-dependent lookup (#2807). Thanks [@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo)](https://github.com/rbrugo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed formatting of certain kinds of ranges of ranges (#2787). Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of maps with element types other than `std::pair` (#2944). Thanks [@BrukerJWD (Jonathan W)](https://github.com/BrukerJWD).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made tuple formatter enabled only if elements are formattable (#2939, #2940). Thanks [@jehelset](https://github.com/jehelset).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::join` compatible with format string compilation (#2719, #2720). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made compile-time checks work with named arguments of custom types and `std::ostream` `print` overloads (#2816, #2817, #2819). Thanks [@timsong-cpp](https://github.com/timsong-cpp).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed `make_args_checked` because it is no longer needed for compile-time checks (#2760). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the following deprecated APIs: `_format`, `arg_join`, the `format_to` overload that takes a memory buffer, `[v]fprintf` that takes an `ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated implicit conversion of `[const] signed char*` and `[const] unsigned char*` to C strings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `fmt/locale.h`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the deprecated `fileno()` with `descriptor()` in `buffered_file`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Moved `to_string_view` to the `detail` namespace since it's an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made access mode of a created file consistent with `fopen` by setting `S_IWGRP` and `S_IWOTH` (#2733). Thanks [@arogge (Andreas Rogge)](https://github.com/arogge).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed a redundant buffer resize when formatting to `std::ostream` (#2842, #2843). Thanks [@jcelerier (Jean-Michaël Celerier)](https://github.com/jcelerier).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made precision computation for strings consistent with width (#2888).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of locale separators in floating point formatting (#2830).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made sign specifiers work with `__int128_t` (#2773).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved support for systems such as CHERI with extra data stored in pointers (#2932).

Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Format string compilation now requires `format` functions of `formatter` specializations for user-defined types to be `const`:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  template <> struct fmt::formatter<my_type>: formatter<string_view> {\r\n    template <typename FormatContext>\r\n    auto format(my_type obj, FormatContext& ctx) const {  // Note const here.\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added UDL-based named argument support to format string compilation (#2243, #2281). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  using namespace fmt::literals;\r\n  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(\"{answer}\"), \"answer\"_a = 42);\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Here the argument named \"answer\" is resolved at compile time with no runtime overhead. Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added format string compilation support to `fmt::print` (#2280, #2304). Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added initial support for compiling {fmt} as a C++20 module (#2235, #2240, #2260, #2282, #2283, #2288, #2298, #2306, #2307, #2309, #2318, #2324, #2332, #2340). Thanks [@DanielaE (Daniela Engert)](https://github.com/DanielaE).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made symbols private by default reducing shared library size (#2301).

Thanks [@kitegi (sarah)](https://github.com/kitegi).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support of `std::byte` and other formattable types to `fmt::join` (#1981, #2040, #2050, #2262). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n  #include <cstddef>\r\n  #include <vector>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto bytes = std::vector{std::byte(4), std::byte(2)};\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", fmt::join(bytes, \"\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"42\".\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@kamibo (Camille Bordignon)](https://github.com/kamibo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Implemented the default format for `std::chrono::system_clock` (#2319, #2345). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", std::chrono::system_clock::now());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"2021-06-18 15:22:00\" (the output depends on the current date and time). Thanks [@sunmy2019](https://github.com/sunmy2019).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made more chrono specifiers locale independent by default. Use the `'L'` specifier to get localized formatting. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"ru_RU.UTF-8\"));\r\n    auto monday = std::chrono::weekday(1);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", monday);   // prints \"Mon\"\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:L}\\n\", monday); // prints \"пн\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved locale handling in chrono formatting (#2337, #2349, #2350). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Deprecated `fmt/locale.h` moving the formatting functions that take a locale to `fmt/format.h` (`char`) and `fmt/xchar` (other overloads). This doesn't introduce a dependency on `<locale>` so there is virtually no compile time effect.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made parameter order in `vformat_to` consistent with `format_to` (#2327).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for time points with arbitrary durations (#2208). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    using tp = std::chrono::time_point<\r\n      std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::seconds>;\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:%S}\", tp(std::chrono::seconds(42)));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"42\".\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Formatting floating-point numbers no longer produces trailing zeros by default for consistency with `std::format`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{0:.3}\", 1.1);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"1.1\". Use the `'#'` specifier to keep trailing zeros.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Dropped a limit on the number of elements in a range and replaced `{}` with `[]` as range delimiters for consistency with Python's `str.format`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  The `'L'` specifier for locale-specific numeric formatting can now be combined with presentation specifiers as in `std::format`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  #include <locale>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"));\r\n    fmt::print(\"{0:.2Lf}\", 0.42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"0,42\". The deprecated `'n'` specifier has been removed.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made the `0` specifier ignored for infinity and NaN (#2305, #2310). Thanks [@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke)](https://github.com/Liedtke).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made the hexfloat formatting use the right alignment by default (#2308, #2317). Thanks [@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke)](https://github.com/Liedtke).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated numeric alignment (`'='`). Use the `'0'` specifier instead.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `fmt/posix.h` header that has been replaced with `fmt/os.h`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `format_to_n_context`, `format_to_n_args` and `make_format_to_n_args`. They have been replaced with `format_context`, `format_args` and `make_format_args` respectively.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Moved `wchar_t`-specific functions and types to `fmt/xchar.h`. You can define `FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_XCHAR` to automatically include `fmt/xchar.h` from `fmt/format.h` but this will be disabled in the next major release.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of the `'+'` specifier in localized formatting (#2133).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for the `'s'` format specifier that gives textual representation of `bool` (#2094, #2109). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:s}\", true);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"true\". Thanks [@powercoderlol (Ivan Polyakov)](https://github.com/powercoderlol).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::ptr` work with function pointers (#2131). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"My main: {}\\n\", fmt::ptr(main));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@mikecrowe (Mike Crowe)](https://github.com/mikecrowe).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed `fmt::formatted_size` with format string compilation (#2141, #2161). Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of empty format strings during format string compilation (#2042):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(\"\"));\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of enums in `fmt::to_string` (#2036).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved width computation (#2033, #2091). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:-<10}{}\\n\", \"你好\", \"世界\");\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:-<10}{}\\n\", \"hello\", \"world\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints\r\n\r\n  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/119840373-cea3ca80-beb9-11eb-91e0-54266c48e181.png)\r\n  \r\n  on a modern terminal.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  The experimental fast output stream (`fmt::ostream`) is now truncated by default for consistency with `fopen` (#2018). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/os.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::ostream out1 = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    out1.print(\"Zaphod\");\r\n    out1.close();\r\n    fmt::ostream out2 = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    out2.print(\"Ford\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  writes \"Ford\" to the file \"guide\". To preserve the old file content if any pass `fmt::file::WRONLY | fmt::file::CREATE` flags to `fmt::output_file`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed moving of `fmt::ostream` that holds buffered data (#2197, #2198). Thanks [@vtta](https://github.com/vtta).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the `fmt::system_error` exception with a function of the same name that constructs `std::system_error` (#2266).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the `fmt::windows_error` exception with a function of the same name that constructs `std::system_error` with the category returned by `fmt::system_category()` (#2274, #2275). The latter is similar to `std::sytem_category` but correctly handles UTF-8. Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced `fmt::error_code` with `std::error_code` and made it formattable (#2269, #2270, #2273). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added speech synthesis support (#2206).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `format_to` work with a memory buffer that has a custom allocator (#2300). Thanks [@voxmea](https://github.com/voxmea).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `Allocator::max_size` support to `basic_memory_buffer`. (#1960). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added wide string support to `fmt::join` (#2236). Thanks [@crbrz](https://github.com/crbrz).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made iterators passed to `formatter` specializations via a format context satisfy C++20 `std::output_iterator` requirements (#2156, #2158, #2195, #2204). Thanks [@randomnetcat (Jason Cobb)](https://github.com/randomnetcat).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Optimized the `printf` implementation (#1982, #1984, #2016, #2164). Thanks [@rimathia](https://github.com/rimathia) and [@moiwi](https://github.com/moiwi).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved detection of `constexpr` `char_traits` (#2246, #2257). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed writing to `stdout` when it is redirected to `NUL` on Windows (#2080).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed exception propagation from iterators (#2097).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved `strftime` error handling (#2238, #2244). Thanks [@yumeyao](https://github.com/yumeyao).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Stopped using deprecated GCC UDL template extension.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt/args.h` to the install target (#2096).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Error messages are now passed to assert when exceptions are disabled (#2145). Thanks [@NobodyXu (Jiahao XU)](https://github.com/NobodyXu).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added the `FMT_MASTER_PROJECT` CMake option to control build and install targets when {fmt} is included via `add_subdirectory` (#2098, #2100). Thanks [@randomizedthinking](https://github.com/randomizedthinking).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved build configuration (#2026, #2122).

This makes {fmt} up to 20-30x faster than common implementations of `std::ostringstream` and `sprintf` on [dtoa-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark) and faster than double-conversion and Ryū:![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/95684665-11719600-0ba8-11eb-8e5b-972ff4e49428.png)It is possible to get even better performance at the cost of larger binary size by compiling with the `FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX` macro set to 1. Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* Added an experimental unsynchronized file output API which, together with [format string compilation](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#compile-api), can give [5-9 times speed up compared to fprintf](https://www.zverovich.net/2020/08/04/optimal-file-buffer-size.html) on common platforms ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/nsTcG8)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/os.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto f = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    f.print(\"The answer is {}.\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Added a formatter for `std::chrono::time_point<system_clock>` (#1819, #1837). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/c4M6fh)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n    fmt::print(\"The time is {:%H:%M:%S}.\\n\", now);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@adamburgess (Adam Burgess)](https://github.com/adamburgess).\r\n\r\n* Added support for ranges with non-const `begin`/`end` to `fmt::join` (#1784, #1786).

Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* Improved handling of single code units in `FMT_COMPILE`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  char* f(char* buf) {\r\n    return fmt::format_to(buf, FMT_COMPILE(\"x{}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  compiles to just ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5vncz3)):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  _Z1fPc:\r\n    movb $120, (%rdi)\r\n    xorl %edx, %edx\r\n    cmpl $42, _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE23zero_or_powers_of_10_32E+8(%rip)\r\n    movl $3, %eax\r\n    seta %dl\r\n    subl %edx, %eax\r\n    movzwl _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE6digitsE+84(%rip), %edx\r\n    cltq\r\n    addq %rdi, %rax\r\n    movw %dx, -2(%rax)\r\n    ret\r\n  ```\r\n  Here a single `mov` instruction writes `'x'` (`$120`) to the output buffer.\r\n\r\n* Added dynamic width support to format string compilation (#1809).\r\n\r\n* Improved error reporting for unformattable types: now you'll get the type name directly in the error message instead of the note:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  struct how_about_no {};\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", how_about_no());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Error ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/GoxM4e)): `fmt/core.h:1438:3: error: static_assert failed due to requirement 'fmt::v7::formattable<how_about_no>()' \"Cannot format an argument. To make type T formattable provide a formatter<T> specialization: https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt\" ...`\r\n\r\n* Added the [make_args_checked](https://fmt.dev/7.1.0/api.html#argument-lists) function template that allows you to write formatting functions with compile-time format string checks and avoid binary code bloat ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/PEf9qr)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  void vlog(const char* file, int line, fmt::string_view format,\r\n            fmt::format_args args) {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}: {}: \", file, line);\r\n    fmt::vprint(format, args);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  template <typename S, typename...

For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/dPhWvj)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:.500}\\n\", 4.9406564584124654E-324);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  prints `4.9406564584124654417656879286822137236505980261432476442558568250067550727020875186529983636163599237979656469544571773092665671035593979639877479601078187812630071319031140452784581716784898210368871863605699873072305000638740915356498438731247339727316961514003171538539807412623856559117102665855668676818703956031062493194527159149245532930545654440112748012970999954193198940908041656332452475714786901472678015935523861155013480352649347201937902681071074917033322268447533357208324319360923829e-324`.\r\n\r\n* Made `format_to_n` and `formatted_size` part of the [core API](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#core-api) ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/sPjY1K)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    char buffer[10];\r\n    auto result = fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"{}\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Added `fmt::format_to_n` overload with format string compilation (#1764, #1767, #1869). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/93h86q)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    char buffer[8];\r\n    fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Kurkin (Dmitry Kurkin)](https://github.com/Kurkin), [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* Added `fmt::format_to` overload that take `text_style` (#1593, #1842, #1843). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/91153r)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::string out;\r\n    fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out),\r\n                   fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),\r\n                   \"The answer is {}.\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Naios (Denis Blank)](https://github.com/Naios).\r\n\r\n* Made the `#` specifier emit trailing zeros in addition to the decimal point (#1797). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bhdcW9)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:#.2g}\", 0.5);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  prints `0.50`.\r\n\r\n* Changed the default floating point format to not include `.0` for consistency with `std::format` and `std::to_chars` (#1893, #1943). It is possible to get the decimal point and trailing zero with the `#` specifier.\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue with floating-point formatting that could result in addition of a non-significant trailing zero in rare cases e.g. `1.00e-34` instead of `1.0e-34` (#1873, #1917).\r\n\r\n* Made `fmt::to_string` fallback on `ostream` insertion operator if the `formatter` specialization is not provided (#1815, #1829). Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* Added support for the append mode to the experimental file API and improved `fcntl.h` detection. (#1847, #1848).

Thanks [@mwinterb](https://github.com/mwinterb).\r\n\r\n* Improved documentation (#1772, #1775, #1792, #1838, #1888, #1918, #1939). Thanks [@leolchat (Léonard Gérard)](https://github.com/leolchat), [@pepsiman (Malcolm Parsons)](https://github.com/pepsiman), [@Klaim (Joël Lamotte)](https://github.com/Klaim), [@ravijanjam (Ravi J)](https://github.com/ravijanjam), [@francesco-st](https://github.com/francesco-st), [@udnaan (Adnan)](https://github.com/udnaan).\r\n\r\n* Added the `FMT_REDUCE_INT_INSTANTIATIONS` CMake option that reduces the binary code size at the cost of some integer formatting performance. This can be useful for extremely memory-constrained embedded systems (#1778, #1781).

For example, on macOS a stripped test binary statically linked with {fmt} [shrank from ~368k to less than 100k](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/05/21/reducing-library-size.html).\r\n\r\n* Added a simpler and more efficient [format string compilation API](https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#compile-api):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  // Converts 42 into std::string using the most efficient method and no\r\n  // runtime format string processing.\r\n  std::string s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), 42);\r\n  ```\r\n  The old `fmt::compile` API is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n  Thanks [@ldionne (Louis Dionne)](https://github.com/ldionne) for the suggestion and [@hanickadot (Hana Dusíková)](https://github.com/hanickadot) for the initial prototype.\r\n\r\n* Optimized integer formatting: `format_to` with format string compilation and a stack-allocated buffer is now [faster than to_chars on both libc++ and libstdc++](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html).\r\n\r\n* Optimized handling of small format strings. For example,\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  fmt::format(\"Result: {}: ({},{},{},{})\", str1, str2, str3, str4, str5)\r\n  ```\r\n  is now ~40% faster (#1685).\r\n\r\n* Applied extern templates to improve compile times when using the core API and `fmt/format.h` (#1452). For example, on macOS with clang the compile time of a test translation unit dropped from 2.3s to 0.3s with `-O2` and from 0.6s to 0.3s with the default settings (`-O0`).\r\n\r\n  Before (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  2.22s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 2.311 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  0.26s user 0.04s system 98% cpu 0.303 total\r\n  ```\r\n  Before (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.53s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.601 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.24s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.301 total\r\n  ```\r\n  It is still recommended to use `fmt/core.h` instead of `fmt/format.h` but the compile time difference is now smaller.

Thanks [@vsolontsov-ll (Vladimir Solontsov)](https://github.com/vsolontsov-ll).\r\n\r\n* Added support for the `'c'` format specifier to integral types for compatibility with `std::format` (#1652).\r\n\r\n* Replaced the `'n'` format specifier with `'L'` for compatibility with `std::format` (#1624). The `'n'` specifier can be enabled via the `FMT_DEPRECATED_N_SPECIFIER` macro.\r\n\r\n* The `'='` format specifier is now disabled by default for compatibility with `std::format`.

The former is still provided as an alias if the `FMT_USE_INTERNAL` macro is defined.\r\n\r\n* Improved compatibility between `fmt::printf` with the standard specs (#1595, #1682, #1683, #1687, #1699). Thanks [@rimathia](https://github.com/rimathia).\r\n\r\n* Fixed handling of `operator<<` overloads that use `copyfmt` (#1666).\r\n\r\n* Added the `FMT_OS` CMake option to control inclusion of OS-specific APIs in the fmt target. This can be useful for embedded platforms (#1654, #1656). Thanks [@kwesolowski (Krzysztof Wesolowski)](https://github.com/kwesolowski).\r\n\r\n* Replaced `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION` with the `FMT_FUZZ` macro to prevent interferring with fuzzing of projects using {fmt} (#1650).
