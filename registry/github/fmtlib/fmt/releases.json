In particular, formatting a `double` with format string compilation into a stack allocated buffer is more than 60% faster in version 12.0 compared to 11.2 according to [dtoa-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark):\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  Function  Time (ns)  Speedup\r\n  fmt11        34.471    1.00x\r\n  fmt12        21.000    1.64x\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"766\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7d768ad-7543-468c-b0bb-449abf73b31b\" />\r\n\r\n- Added `constexpr` support to `fmt::format`.

Thanks @msvetkin.\r\n\r\n- Added `FMT_STATIC_FORMAT` that allows formatting into a string of the exact required size at compile time.\r\n\r\n  For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n\r\n  constexpr auto s = FMT_STATIC_FORMAT(\"{}\", 42);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  compiles to just\r\n\r\n  ```s\r\n  __ZL1s:\r\n        .asciiz \"42\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  It can be accessed as a C string with `s.c_str()` or as a string view with `s.str()`.\r\n\r\n- Improved C++20 module support (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4451, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4459, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4476, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4488, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4491, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4495). Thanks @arBmind, @tkhyn, @Mishura4, @anonymouspc and @autoantwort.\r\n\r\n- Switched to using estimated display width in precision.

Thanks @nikhilreddydev and @localspook.\r\n\r\n- Fix interaction between debug presentation, precision, and width for strings (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4478). Thanks @localspook.\r\n\r\n- Implemented allocator propagation on `basic_memory_buffer` move (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4487, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4490). Thanks @toprakmurat.\r\n\r\n- Fixed an ambiguity between `std::reference_wrapper<T>` and `format_as` formatters (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4424, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4434). Thanks @jeremy-rifkin.\r\n\r\n- Removed the following deprecated APIs:\r\n\r\n  - `has_formatter`: use `is_formattable` instead, - `basic_format_args::parse_context_type`, `basic_format_args::formatter_type` and similar aliases in context types, - wide stream overload of `fmt::printf`, - wide stream overloads of `fmt::print` that take text styles, - `is_*char` traits, - `fmt::localtime`.\r\n\r\n- Deprecated wide overloads of `fmt::fprintf` and `fmt::sprintf`.\r\n\r\n- Improved diagnostics for the incorrect usage of `fmt::ptr` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4453). Thanks @TobiSchluter.\r\n\r\n- Made handling of ANSI escape sequences more efficient (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4511, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4528). Thanks @localspook and @Anas-Hamdane.\r\n\r\n- Fixed a buffer overflow on all emphasis flags set (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4498). Thanks @dominicpoeschko.\r\n\r\n- Fixed an integer overflow for precision close to the max `int` value.\r\n\r\n- Fixed compatibility with WASI (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4496, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4497). Thanks @whitequark.\r\n\r\n- Fixed `back_insert_iterator` detection, preventing a fallback on slower path that handles arbitrary iterators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4454).\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of invalid glibc `FILE` buffers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4469).\r\n\r\n- Added `wchar_t` support to the `std::byte` formatter (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4479, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4480). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Changed component prefix from `fmt-` to `fmt_` for compatibility with NSIS/CPack on Windows, e.g. `fmt-doc` changed to `fmt_doc` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4441, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4442). Thanks @n-stein.\r\n\r\n- Added the `FMT_CUSTOM_ASSERT_FAIL` macro to simplify providing a custom `fmt::assert_fail` implementation (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4505). Thanks @HazardyKnusperkeks.\r\n\r\n- Switched to `FMT_THROW` on reporting format errors so that it can be overriden by users when exceptions are disabled (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4521). Thanks @HazardyKnusperkeks.\r\n\r\n- Improved master project detection and disabled install targets when using {fmt} as a subproject by default (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4536). Thanks @crueter.\r\n\r\n- Made various code improvements (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4445, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4448, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4473, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4522).

Thanks @W4RH4WK and @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Fixed compatibility with platforms that use 80-bit `long double` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4245, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4246). Thanks @jsirpoma.\r\n\r\n- Added support for UTF-32 code units greater than `0xFFFF` in fill (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4201).\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of legacy encodings on Windows with GCC (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4162).\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::to_string` take `fmt::basic_memory_buffer` by const reference (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4261, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4262). Thanks @sascha-devel.\r\n\r\n- Added `fmt::dynamic_format_arg_store::size` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4270). Thanks @hannes-harnisch.\r\n\r\n- Removed the ability to control locale usage via an undocumented `FMT_STATIC_THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR` in favor of `FMT_USE_LOCALE`.\r\n\r\n- Renamed `FMT_EXCEPTIONS` to `FMT_USE_EXCEPTIONS` for consistency with other similar macros.\r\n\r\n- Improved include directory ordering to reduce the chance of including incorrect headers when using multiple versions of {fmt} (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4116). Thanks @cdzhan.\r\n\r\n- Made it possible to compile a subset of {fmt} without the C++ runtime.\r\n\r\n- Improved documentation and README (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4066, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4117, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4203, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4235).

This brings the compile time of code using {fmt} much closer to the equivalent `printf` code as shown on the following benchmark that compiles 100 source files:\r\n\r\n  | Method       | Compile Time (s) |\r\n  |--------------|------------------|\r\n  | printf       | 1.6              |\r\n  | IOStreams    | 25.9             |\r\n  | fmt 10.x     | 19.0             |\r\n  | fmt 11.0     | 4.8              |\r\n  | tinyformat   | 29.1             |\r\n  | Boost Format | 55.0             |\r\n\r\n  This gives almost 4x improvement in build speed compared to version 10. Note that the benchmark is purely formatting code and includes. In real projects the difference from `printf` will be smaller partly because common standard headers will be included in almost any translation unit (TU) anyway. In particular, in every case except `printf` above ~1s is spent in total on including `<type_traits>` in all TUs.\r\n\r\n- Optimized includes in other headers such as `fmt/format.h` which is now roughly equivalent to the old `fmt/core.h` in terms of build speed.\r\n\r\n- Migrated the documentation at https://fmt.dev/ from Sphinx to MkDocs.\r\n\r\n- Improved C++20 module support (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3990, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3991, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3993, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3994, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3997, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3998, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4004, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4005, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4006, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4013, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4027, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4029). In particular, native CMake support for modules is now used if available. Thanks @yujincheng08 and @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Added an option to replace standard includes with `import std` enabled via the `FMT_IMPORT_STD` macro (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3921, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3928). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Exported `fmt::range_format`, `fmt::range_format_kind` and `fmt::compiled_string` from the `fmt` module (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3970, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3999). Thanks @matt77hias and @yujincheng08.\r\n\r\n- Improved integration with stdio in `fmt::print`, enabling direct writes into a C stream buffer in common cases. This may give significant performance improvements ranging from tens of percent to [2x]( https://stackoverflow.com/a/78457454/471164) and eliminates dynamic memory allocations on the buffer level. It is currently enabled for built-in and string types with wider availability coming up in future releases.\r\n\r\n  For example, it gives ~24% improvement on a [simple benchmark]( https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3107R5.html#perf) compiled with Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5) and run on macOS 14.2.1:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Benchmark             Time             CPU   Iterations\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  printf             81.8 ns         81.5 ns      8496899\r\n  fmt::print (10.x)  63.8 ns         61.9 ns     11524151\r\n  fmt::print (11.0)  51.3 ns         51.0 ns     13846580\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Improved safety of `fmt::format_to` when writing to an array (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3805). For example ([godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/cYrn8dWY8)):\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  auto volkswagen = char[4];\r\n  auto result = fmt::format_to(volkswagen, \"elephant\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  no longer results in a buffer overflow. Instead the output will be truncated and you can get the end iterator and whether truncation occurred from the `result` object. Thanks @ThePhD.\r\n\r\n- Enabled Unicode support by default in MSVC, bringing it on par with other compilers and making it unnecessary for users to enable it explicitly. Most of {fmt} is encoding-agnostic but this prevents mojibake in places where encoding matters such as path formatting and terminal output. You can control the Unicode support via the CMake `FMT_UNICODE` option. Note that some {fmt} packages such as the one in vcpkg have already been compiled with Unicode enabled.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::expected` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3834). Thanks @dominicpoeschko.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::complex` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1467, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3886, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3892, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3900). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::type_info` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3978). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Specialized `formatter` for `std::basic_string` types with custom traits and allocators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3938, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3943). Thanks @dieram3.\r\n\r\n- Added formatters for `std::chrono::day`, `std::chrono::month`, `std::chrono::year` and `std::chrono::year_month_day` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3758, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3772, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3906, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3913). For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n\r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::green), \"{}\\n\", std::chrono::day(7));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  prints a green day:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"306\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/assets/576385/6e395f8b-451a-4cf7-bccc-ee92ca0dec65\">\r\n\r\n  Thanks @zivshek.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of precision in `%S` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3794, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3814).

\r\n  \r\n  Replaced Grisu with a new floating-point formatting algorithm for given precision (#3262, #2750, #3269, #3276). The new algorithm is based on Dragonbox already used for the shortest representation and gives substantial performance improvement:![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33922675/211956670-84891a09-6867-47d9-82fc-3230da7abe0f.png)\r\n  \r\n  * \r\n    \r\n    Red: new algorithm\r\n  \r\n  * \r\n    \r\n    Green: new algorithm with `FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX` defined to 1\r\n  \r\n  * \r\n    \r\n    Blue: old algorithm\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced `snprintf`-based hex float formatter with an internal implementation (#3179, #3203).

\r\n  \r\n  Switched to the internal floating point formatter for all decimal presentation formats. In particular this results in consistent rounding on all platforms and removing the `s[n]printf` fallback for decimal FP formatting.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Compile-time floating point formatting no longer requires the header-only mode. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/G37PTeG3b)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <array>\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  consteval auto compile_time_dtoa(double value) -> std::array<char, 10> {\r\n    auto result = std::array<char, 10>();\r\n    fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), value);\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  constexpr auto answer = compile_time_dtoa(0.42);\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  works with the default settings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved the implementation of [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox), the algorithm used for the default floating-point formatting (#2713, #2750). Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::to_string` work with `__float128`. This uses the internal FP formatter and works even on system without `__float128` support in `[s]printf`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Disabled automatic `std::ostream` insertion operator (`operator<<`) discovery when `fmt/ostream.h` is included to prevent ODR violations. You can get the old behavior by defining `FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM` but this will be removed in the next major release. Use `fmt::streamed` or `fmt::ostream_formatter` to enable formatting via `std::ostream` instead.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::ostream_formatter` that can be used to write `formatter` specializations that perform formatting via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5sEc5qMsf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  struct date {\r\n    int year, month, day;\r\n  \r\n    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const date& d) {\r\n      return os << d.year << '-' << d.month << '-' << d.day;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  template <> struct fmt::formatter<date> : ostream_formatter {};\r\n  \r\n  std::string s = fmt::format(\"The date is {}\", date{2012, 12, 9});\r\n  // s == \"The date is 2012-12-9\"\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added the `fmt::streamed` function that takes an object and formats it via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5G3346G1f)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\",\r\n               fmt::streamed(std::this_thread::get_id()));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Note that `fmt/std.h` provides a `formatter` specialization for `std::thread::id` so you don't need to format it via `std::ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Deprecated implicit conversions of unscoped enums to integers for consistency with scoped enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added an argument-dependent lookup based `format_as` extension API to simplify formatting of enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::variant` formatting support (#2941). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/KG9z6cq68)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <variant>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto v = std::variant<int, std::string>(42);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", v);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  variant(42)\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@jehelset](https://github.com/jehelset).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::filesystem::path` formatting support (#2865, #2902, #2917, #2918). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/o44dMexEb)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <filesystem>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"There is no place like {}.\", std::filesystem::path(\"/home\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  There is no place like \"/home\".\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added a `std::thread::id` formatter to `fmt/std.h`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/j1azbYf3E)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\", std::this_thread::get_id());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::styled` that applies a text style to an individual argument (#2793). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/vWGW7v5M6)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n    fmt::print(\r\n      \"[{}] {}: {}\\n\",\r\n      fmt::styled(now, fmt::emphasis::bold),\r\n      fmt::styled(\"error\", fg(fmt::color::red)),\r\n      \"something went wrong\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/175071215-12809244-dab0-4005-96d8-7cd911c964d5.png)\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo)](https://github.com/rbrugo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::print` overload for text styles correctly handle UTF-8 (#2681, #2701). Thanks [@AlexGuteniev (Alex Guteniev)](https://github.com/AlexGuteniev).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed Unicode handling when writing to an ostream.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for nested specifiers to range formatting (#2673). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/xd3Gj38cf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <vector>\r\n  #include <fmt/ranges.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{::#x}\\n\", std::vector{10, 20, 30});\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints `[0xa, 0x14, 0x1e]`.\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Implemented escaping of wide strings in ranges (#2904). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for ranges with `begin` / `end` found via the argument-dependent lookup (#2807). Thanks [@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo)](https://github.com/rbrugo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed formatting of certain kinds of ranges of ranges (#2787). Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of maps with element types other than `std::pair` (#2944).

Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made compile-time checks work with named arguments of custom types and `std::ostream` `print` overloads (#2816, #2817, #2819). Thanks [@timsong-cpp](https://github.com/timsong-cpp).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed `make_args_checked` because it is no longer needed for compile-time checks (#2760). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the following deprecated APIs: `_format`, `arg_join`, the `format_to` overload that takes a memory buffer, `[v]fprintf` that takes an `ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated implicit conversion of `[const] signed char*` and `[const] unsigned char*` to C strings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `fmt/locale.h`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the deprecated `fileno()` with `descriptor()` in `buffered_file`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Moved `to_string_view` to the `detail` namespace since it's an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made access mode of a created file consistent with `fopen` by setting `S_IWGRP` and `S_IWOTH` (#2733). Thanks [@arogge (Andreas Rogge)](https://github.com/arogge).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed a redundant buffer resize when formatting to `std::ostream` (#2842, #2843).

Thanks [@sergiud (Sergiu Deitsch)](https://github.com/sergiud).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Optimized includes making the result of preprocessing `fmt/format.h` ~20% smaller with libstdc++/C++20 and slightly improving build times (#1998).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support of ranges with non-const `begin` / `end` (#1953). Thanks [@kitegi (sarah)](https://github.com/kitegi).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support of `std::byte` and other formattable types to `fmt::join` (#1981, #2040, #2050, #2262). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n  #include <cstddef>\r\n  #include <vector>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto bytes = std::vector{std::byte(4), std::byte(2)};\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", fmt::join(bytes, \"\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"42\".\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@kamibo (Camille Bordignon)](https://github.com/kamibo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Implemented the default format for `std::chrono::system_clock` (#2319, #2345). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", std::chrono::system_clock::now());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"2021-06-18 15:22:00\" (the output depends on the current date and time). Thanks [@sunmy2019](https://github.com/sunmy2019).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made more chrono specifiers locale independent by default. Use the `'L'` specifier to get localized formatting. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"ru_RU.UTF-8\"));\r\n    auto monday = std::chrono::weekday(1);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", monday);   // prints \"Mon\"\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:L}\\n\", monday); // prints \"–ø–Ω\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved locale handling in chrono formatting (#2337, #2349, #2350). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Deprecated `fmt/locale.h` moving the formatting functions that take a locale to `fmt/format.h` (`char`) and `fmt/xchar` (other overloads). This doesn't introduce a dependency on `<locale>` so there is virtually no compile time effect.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made parameter order in `vformat_to` consistent with `format_to` (#2327).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for time points with arbitrary durations (#2208). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    using tp = std::chrono::time_point<\r\n      std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::seconds>;\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:%S}\", tp(std::chrono::seconds(42)));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"42\".\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Formatting floating-point numbers no longer produces trailing zeros by default for consistency with `std::format`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{0:.3}\", 1.1);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"1.1\". Use the `'#'` specifier to keep trailing zeros.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Dropped a limit on the number of elements in a range and replaced `{}` with `[]` as range delimiters for consistency with Python's `str.format`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  The `'L'` specifier for locale-specific numeric formatting can now be combined with presentation specifiers as in `std::format`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  #include <locale>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"));\r\n    fmt::print(\"{0:.2Lf}\", 0.42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"0,42\". The deprecated `'n'` specifier has been removed.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made the `0` specifier ignored for infinity and NaN (#2305, #2310). Thanks [@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke)](https://github.com/Liedtke).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made the hexfloat formatting use the right alignment by default (#2308, #2317). Thanks [@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke)](https://github.com/Liedtke).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated numeric alignment (`'='`). Use the `'0'` specifier instead.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `fmt/posix.h` header that has been replaced with `fmt/os.h`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `format_to_n_context`, `format_to_n_args` and `make_format_to_n_args`. They have been replaced with `format_context`, `format_args` and `make_format_args` respectively.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Moved `wchar_t`-specific functions and types to `fmt/xchar.h`. You can define `FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_XCHAR` to automatically include `fmt/xchar.h` from `fmt/format.h` but this will be disabled in the next major release.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of the `'+'` specifier in localized formatting (#2133).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for the `'s'` format specifier that gives textual representation of `bool` (#2094, #2109). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:s}\", true);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints \"true\". Thanks [@powercoderlol (Ivan Polyakov)](https://github.com/powercoderlol).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::ptr` work with function pointers (#2131). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"My main: {}\\n\", fmt::ptr(main));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@mikecrowe (Mike Crowe)](https://github.com/mikecrowe).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed `fmt::formatted_size` with format string compilation (#2141, #2161). Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of empty format strings during format string compilation (#2042):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(\"\"));\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of enums in `fmt::to_string` (#2036).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved width computation (#2033, #2091). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:-<10}{}\\n\", \"‰Ω†Â•Ω\", \"‰∏ñÁïå\");\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:-<10}{}\\n\", \"hello\", \"world\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints\r\n\r\n  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/119840373-cea3ca80-beb9-11eb-91e0-54266c48e181.png)\r\n  \r\n  on a modern terminal.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  The experimental fast output stream (`fmt::ostream`) is now truncated by default for consistency with `fopen` (#2018). For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/os.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::ostream out1 = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    out1.print(\"Zaphod\");\r\n    out1.close();\r\n    fmt::ostream out2 = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    out2.print(\"Ford\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  writes \"Ford\" to the file \"guide\". To preserve the old file content if any pass `fmt::file::WRONLY | fmt::file::CREATE` flags to `fmt::output_file`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed moving of `fmt::ostream` that holds buffered data (#2197, #2198). Thanks [@vtta](https://github.com/vtta).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the `fmt::system_error` exception with a function of the same name that constructs `std::system_error` (#2266).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the `fmt::windows_error` exception with a function of the same name that constructs `std::system_error` with the category returned by `fmt::system_category()` (#2274, #2275). The latter is similar to `std::sytem_category` but correctly handles UTF-8. Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced `fmt::error_code` with `std::error_code` and made it formattable (#2269, #2270, #2273). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added speech synthesis support (#2206).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `format_to` work with a memory buffer that has a custom allocator (#2300). Thanks [@voxmea](https://github.com/voxmea).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `Allocator::max_size` support to `basic_memory_buffer`. (#1960). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added wide string support to `fmt::join` (#2236). Thanks [@crbrz](https://github.com/crbrz).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made iterators passed to `formatter` specializations via a format context satisfy C++20 `std::output_iterator` requirements (#2156, #2158, #2195, #2204). Thanks [@randomnetcat (Jason Cobb)](https://github.com/randomnetcat).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Optimized the `printf` implementation (#1982, #1984, #2016, #2164). Thanks [@rimathia](https://github.com/rimathia) and [@moiwi](https://github.com/moiwi).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved detection of `constexpr` `char_traits` (#2246, #2257). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed writing to `stdout` when it is redirected to `NUL` on Windows (#2080).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed exception propagation from iterators (#2097).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved `strftime` error handling (#2238, #2244). Thanks [@yumeyao](https://github.com/yumeyao).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Stopped using deprecated GCC UDL template extension.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt/args.h` to the install target (#2096).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Error messages are now passed to assert when exceptions are disabled (#2145). Thanks [@NobodyXu (Jiahao XU)](https://github.com/NobodyXu).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added the `FMT_MASTER_PROJECT` CMake option to control build and install targets when {fmt} is included via `add_subdirectory` (#2098, #2100). Thanks [@randomizedthinking](https://github.com/randomizedthinking).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved build configuration (#2026, #2122). Thanks [@luncliff (Park DongHa)](https://github.com/luncliff) and [@ibaned (Dan Ibanez)](https://github.com/ibaned).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed various warnings and compilation issues (#1947, #1959, #1963, #1965, #1966, #1974, #1975, #1990, #2000, #2001, #2002, #2004, #2006, #2009, #2010, #2038, #2039, #2047, #2053, #2059, #2065, #2067, #2068, #2073, #2103 #2105 #2106, #2107, #2116 #2117, #2118 #2119, #2127, #2128, #2140, #2142, #2143, #2144, #2147, #2148, #2149, #2152, #2160, #2170, #2175, #2176, #2177, #2178, #2179, #2180, #2181, #2183, #2184, #2185, #2186, #2187, #2190, #2192, #2194, #2205, #2210, #2211, #2215, #2216, #2218, #2220, #2228, #2229, #2230, #2233, #2239, #2248, #2252, #2253, #2255, #2261, #2278, #2284, #2287, #2289, #2290, #2293, #2295, #2296, #2297, #2311, #2313, #2315, #2320, #2321, #2323, #2328, #2329, #2333, #2338, #2341).

For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/93h86q)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    char buffer[8];\r\n    fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Kurkin (Dmitry Kurkin)](https://github.com/Kurkin), [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* Added `fmt::format_to` overload that take `text_style` (#1593, #1842, #1843). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/91153r)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::string out;\r\n    fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out),\r\n                   fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),\r\n                   \"The answer is {}.\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Naios (Denis Blank)](https://github.com/Naios).\r\n\r\n* Made the `#` specifier emit trailing zeros in addition to the decimal point (#1797). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bhdcW9)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:#.2g}\", 0.5);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  prints `0.50`.\r\n\r\n* Changed the default floating point format to not include `.0` for consistency with `std::format` and `std::to_chars` (#1893, #1943). It is possible to get the decimal point and trailing zero with the `#` specifier.\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue with floating-point formatting that could result in addition of a non-significant trailing zero in rare cases e.g. `1.00e-34` instead of `1.0e-34` (#1873, #1917).\r\n\r\n* Made `fmt::to_string` fallback on `ostream` insertion operator if the `formatter` specialization is not provided (#1815, #1829).

For example, on macOS a stripped test binary statically linked with {fmt} [shrank from ~368k to less than 100k](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/05/21/reducing-library-size.html).\r\n\r\n* Added a simpler and more efficient [format string compilation API](https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#compile-api):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  // Converts 42 into std::string using the most efficient method and no\r\n  // runtime format string processing.\r\n  std::string s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), 42);\r\n  ```\r\n  The old `fmt::compile` API is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n  Thanks [@ldionne (Louis Dionne)](https://github.com/ldionne) for the suggestion and [@hanickadot (Hana Dus√≠kov√°)](https://github.com/hanickadot) for the initial prototype.\r\n\r\n* Optimized integer formatting: `format_to` with format string compilation and a stack-allocated buffer is now [faster than to_chars on both libc++ and libstdc++](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html).\r\n\r\n* Optimized handling of small format strings. For example,\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  fmt::format(\"Result: {}: ({},{},{},{})\", str1, str2, str3, str4, str5)\r\n  ```\r\n  is now ~40% faster (#1685).\r\n\r\n* Applied extern templates to improve compile times when using the core API and `fmt/format.h` (#1452). For example, on macOS with clang the compile time of a test translation unit dropped from 2.3s to 0.3s with `-O2` and from 0.6s to 0.3s with the default settings (`-O0`).\r\n\r\n  Before (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  2.22s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 2.311 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  0.26s user 0.04s system 98% cpu 0.303 total\r\n  ```\r\n  Before (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.53s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.601 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.24s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.301 total\r\n  ```\r\n  It is still recommended to use `fmt/core.h` instead of `fmt/format.h` but the compile time difference is now smaller. Thanks [@alex3d](https://github.com/alex3d) for the suggestion.\r\n\r\n* Named arguments are now stored on stack (no dynamic memory allocations) and the compiled code is more compact and efficient.

Thanks [@vsolontsov-ll (Vladimir Solontsov)](https://github.com/vsolontsov-ll).\r\n\r\n* Added support for the `'c'` format specifier to integral types for compatibility with `std::format` (#1652).\r\n\r\n* Replaced the `'n'` format specifier with `'L'` for compatibility with `std::format` (#1624). The `'n'` specifier can be enabled via the `FMT_DEPRECATED_N_SPECIFIER` macro.\r\n\r\n* The `'='` format specifier is now disabled by default for compatibility with `std::format`. It can be enabled via the `FMT_DEPRECATED_NUMERIC_ALIGN` macro.\r\n\r\n* Removed the following deprecated APIs:\r\n\r\n  * `FMT_STRING_ALIAS` and `fmt` macros - replaced by `FMT_STRING`\r\n  \r\n  * `fmt::basic_string_view::char_type` - replaced by `fmt::basic_string_view::value_type`\r\n  \r\n  * `convert_to_int`\r\n  \r\n  * `format_arg_store::types`\r\n  \r\n  * `*parse_context` - replaced by `*format_parse_context`\r\n  \r\n  * `FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS`\r\n  \r\n  * `FMT_DEPRECATED_PERCENT` - incompatible with `std::format`\r\n  \r\n  * `*writer` - replaced by compiled format API\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n* Renamed the `internal` namespace to `detail` (#1538). The former is still provided as an alias if the `FMT_USE_INTERNAL` macro is defined.\r\n\r\n* Improved compatibility between `fmt::printf` with the standard specs (#1595, #1682, #1683, #1687, #1699). Thanks [@rimathia](https://github.com/rimathia).\r\n\r\n* Fixed handling of `operator<<` overloads that use `copyfmt` (#1666).\r\n\r\n* Added the `FMT_OS` CMake option to control inclusion of OS-specific APIs in the fmt target. This can be useful for embedded platforms (#1654, #1656). Thanks [@kwesolowski (Krzysztof Wesolowski)](https://github.com/kwesolowski).\r\n\r\n* Replaced `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION` with the `FMT_FUZZ` macro to prevent interferring with fuzzing of projects using {fmt} (#1650). Thanks [@asraa (Asra Ali)](https://github.com/asraa).\r\n\r\n* Fixed compatibility with emscripten (#1636, #1637). Thanks [@ArthurSonzogni (Arthur Sonzogni)](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni).\r\n\r\n* Improved documentation (#704, #1643, #1660, #1681, #1691, #1706, #1714, #1721, #1739, #1740, #1741, #1751).
