Breaking\r\n\r\n* If `SWIFTLINT_DISABLE_SOURCEKIT` is set to prohibit loading `libsourcekitdInProc` at runtime,\r\n  rules requiring SourceKit will be disabled and a warning will be printed once per rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  \r\n* The `operator_whitespace` rule has been removed and its functionality merged into the\r\n  `function_name_whitespace` rule. The latter now also checks spacing around the `func`\r\n  keyword, the function name/operator and its generic parameters while respecting comments.\r\n  On top of that, it supports autocorrection.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  \r\n* Expose only `TestHelpers` and `ExtraRulesTests` as part of Bazel releases.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Experimental\r\n\r\n* Both Linux release archives (for AMD64 and ARM64) now contain two binaries:\r\n  * A dynamically linked binary that requires `libsourcekitdInProc.so` together with its\r\n    transitive dependencies to be present on the system at runtime. It is named `swiftlint`\r\n    and the same binary as before. It supports all built-in rules.\r\n  * A fully statically linked binary named `swiftlint-static` that does not require\r\n    any dynamic libraries at runtime. Rules requiring SourceKit will be disabled and\r\n    reported to the console when running this binary.\r\n  <!-- Keep empty line to have the contributors on a separate line. -->\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* A fully statically linked Linux binary can now be built with the Swift SDK and\r\n  the compiler options `-Xswiftc -DSWIFTLINT_DISABLE_SOURCEKIT`. This binary does not\r\n  require `libsourcekitdInProc.so` or any other dynamic libraries to be present on the\r\n  system at runtime. Rules requiring SourceKit will be disabled and reported to the console\r\n  when running this binary.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add `function_name_whitespace` rule to enforce consistent spacing between the `func`\r\n  keyword, function name, and its generic parameters. Ensures exactly one space between\r\n  `func` and the function name, and configurable spacing around generics via\r\n  `generic_spacing`:\r\n  * `no_space` (default): `func name<T>()`\r\n  * `leading_space`: `func name <T>()`\r\n  * `trailing_space`: `func name<T> ()`\r\n  * `leading_trailing_space`: `func name <T> ()`\r\n  <!-- Enforce line break. -->\r\n  Supports autocorrection.  \r\n  [GandaLF2006](https://github.com/GandaLF2006)\r\n\r\n* The `operator_whitespace` rule now supports autocorrection and better respects comments in\r\n  function declarations. The rule has been deprecated in favor of the new `function_name_whitespace`\r\n  rule. You can still refer to it by its identifier, but get checking for normal function names\r\n  on top.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* In `line_length` rule, treat strings with opening and closing quotes in the same line as\r\n  single-line strings no matter if they are enclosed by triple quotes or not. Furthermore,\r\n  improve detection of comment-only lines.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#6220](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6220)\r\n  [#6219](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6219)\r\n\r\n* Improve detection of comment-only lines in `file_length` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#6219](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6219)\r\n  \r\n* Rewrite `quick_discouraged_call` rule with SwiftSyntax.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Ensure that header matched against always end in a newline in `file_header` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#6227](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6227)\r\n\r\n* Fix `closure_end_indentation` rule reporting violations when the called base\r\n  involves chained optional expressions.  \r\n

[#6135](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6135)\r\n\r\n* The `redundant_optional_initialization` rule has been replaced by the\r\n  `implicit_optional_initialization` rule that enforces implicit or explicit initialization\r\n  of optional variables. Its default style `always` mimics the behavior of the\r\n  `redundant_optional_initialization` rule by default. `redundant_optional_initialization`\r\n  is now an alias for `implicit_optional_initialization`.  \r\n  [leo-lem](https://github.com/leo-lem)  \r\n  [#1940](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1940)\r\n\r\n* The `swiftlint_linux.zip` release archive has been renamed to `swiftlint_linux_amd64.zip`\r\n  to avoid confusion with the new `swiftlint_linux_arm64.zip` archive.  \r\n  [Bradley Mackey](https://github.com/bradleymackey)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Linting got up to 30% faster due to the praiseworthy performance\r\n  improvements done in the [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax) library.\r\n\r\n* Ignore locally defined `count` identifiers in `empty_count` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5326](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5326)\r\n\r\n* The `private_swiftui_state` rule now applies to `ViewModifier` types.  \r\n  [mt00chikin](https://github.com/mt00chikin)\r\n\r\n* Support for ARM64 Linux binaries has been added. The `swiftlint_linux.zip` release archive\r\n  has been renamed to `swiftlint_linux_amd64.zip`. Next to it, a new `swiftlint_linux_arm64.zip`\r\n  archive has been added. The `SwiftLintBinary.artifactbundle.zip` now contains both versions\r\n  of the Linux binary, so that the [binary plugins](https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins)\r\n  can now be used on Linux and macOS running both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.  \r\n  [Bradley Mackey](https://github.com/bradleymackey)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add `include_variables` configuration option to `non_optional_string_data_conversion` rule.  \r\n  When enabled, the rule will trigger on variables, properties, and function calls in addition\r\n  to string literals.

They can be configured using the\r\n  new `excluded_types` option which by default excludes `extension` and `protocol` types.\r\n  This means the rule now checks `struct`, `class`, `actor` and `enum` by default. To enable\r\n  checking of extensions and protocols, set `excluded_types` to an empty array or exclude other\r\n  types as needed.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Exclude explicit system modules from `duplicate_imports` analysis, that is, modules\r\n  that are part of the system frameworks but need to be imported explicitly due to being\r\n  declared as `explicit module` in their module map.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#6098](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6098)\r\n\r\n* Ignore various assignment operators like `=`, `+=`, `&=`, etc. with right-hand side\r\n  ternary expressions otherwise violating the `void_function_in_ternary` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5611](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5611)\r\n\r\n* Rewrite the following rules with SwiftSyntax:\r\n  * `accessibility_label_for_image`\r\n  * `accessibility_trait_for_button`\r\n  * `closure_end_indentation`\r\n  * `expiring_todo`\r\n  * `file_header`\r\n  * `file_length`\r\n  * `line_length`\r\n  * `trailing_whitespace`\r\n  * `vertical_whitespace`\r\n  <!-- Keep empty line to have the contributors on a separate line. -->\r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Matt Pennig](https://github.com/pennig)\r\n\r\n* Add `excluded_paths` option to the `file_name` rule. It allows to exclude complete file\r\n  paths from analysis. All entries are treated as regular expressions. A single match in\r\n  its full path is enough to ignore a file. This is different from the `excluded` option\r\n  that only accepts and checks against file names.  \r\n  [Ueeek](https://github.com/Ueeek)\r\n  [#6066](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6066)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positives of `redundant_discardable_let` rule in `@ViewBuilder` functions,\r\n  `#Preview` macro bodies and preview providers when `ignore_swiftui_view_bodies` is\r\n  enabled.  \r\n  [kaseken](https://github.com/kaseken)\r\n  [#6063](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6063)\r\n\r\n* Improve `multiline_parameters` rule to correctly support  \r\n  `max_number_of_single_line_parameters` and detect mixed formatting.  \r\n  [GandaLF2006](https://github.com/GandaLF2006)\r\n  \r\n* Add new `prefer_condition_list` rule that triggers when a `guard`/`if`/`while`\r\n  condition is composed of multiple expressions connected by the `&&` operator.\r\n  It suggests to use a condition list instead, which is more idiomatic.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add `ignore_coding_keys` parameter to `nesting` rule. Setting this to true prevents\r\n  `CodingKey` enums from violating the rule.  \r\n  [braker1nine](https://github.com/braker1nine)\r\n  [#5641](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5641)\r\n  \r\n* Support deinitializers and subscripts in `function_body_length` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  \r\n* Extend the `xct_specific_matcher` rule to support identity operators (`===` and `!==`)\r\n  in addition to the existing equality operators (`==` and `!=`).  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5849](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5849)\r\n\r\n* Add new `implicit_optional_initialization` rule to enforce implicit or explicit  \r\n  initialization of optional variables, configurable via `style: always | never`.\r\n  It replaces the `redundant_optional_initialization` rule mimicking it with the\r\n  `style: always` option which is the default.  \r\n  [leo-lem](https://github.com/leo-lem)  \r\n  [#1940](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1940)\r\n\r\n* Add new `ignore_identity_closures` parameter to `prefer_key_paths` rule to skip\r\n  conversion of identity closures (`{ $0 }`) to identity key paths (`\\.self`).\r\n  Note that identity key paths are only supported from Swift 6 on, hence this option\r\n  will be implicitly ignored/set to `true` when SwiftLint detects a Swift <6 compiler\r\n  to avoid causing compilation errors.  \r\n  [p4checo](https://github.com/p4checo)\r\n  [#5965](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5965)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix `no_extension_access_modifier` rule incorrectly triggering for `nonisolated extension`.\r\n  The rule now only flags actual access control modifiers (`private`, `public`, `open`,\r\n  `internal`, `fileprivate`) and ignores isolation modifiers like `nonisolated`.  \r\n  [copilot](https://github.com/copilot)\r\n  [#6168](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6168)\r\n\r\n* Improved error reporting when SwiftLint exits, because of an invalid configuration file\r\n  or other error.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#6052](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6052)\r\n  \r\n* Keep the default severity levels when neither `warning` nor `error` values are

Breaking\r\n\r\n* Remove tracking of correction positions. Print the number of corrections applied instead.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Experimental\r\n\r\n* Introduce `swiftlint-dev` command line tool that's intended to help to develop SwiftLint by encapsulating repetitive\r\n  tasks. It can already be used to generate templates for new rules including optional configurations and tests. Run\r\n  `swift run swiftlint-dev rules template -h` to get an overview of the command's usage and the available\r\n  customization options. To register new rules, run `swift run swiftlint-dev rules register`.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Add new option `ignores_multiline_strings` to `line_length` rule. It allows to ignore too long\r\n  lines inside of multiline strings.  \r\n  [thisIsTheFoxe](https://github.com/thisisthefoxe)\r\n  [#2689](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/2689)\r\n\r\n* Ignore `UIColor` initializers in `no_magic_numbers` rule.  \r\n  [suojae](https://github.com/suojae)\r\n  [hyeffie](https://github.com/hyeffie)\r\n  [#5183](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5183)\r\n\r\n* Exclude types with a `@Suite` attribute and functions annotated with `@Test` from `no_magic_numbers` rule.\r\n  Also treat a type as a `@Suite` if it contains `@Test` functions.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5964](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5964)\r\n\r\n* Add new `opaque_over_existential` opt-in rule that triggers when the existential `any` type of a\r\n  function parameter can be replaced with an opaque `some` type.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add a new rationale property to rule descriptions, providing a more expansive\r\n  description of the motivation behind each rule.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#5681](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5681)\r\n\r\n* Add new `allowed_types` option to `legacy_objc_type` rule to ignore certain types.  \r\n  [kapitoshka438](https://github.com/kapitoshka438)\r\n  [#3723](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3723)\r\n\r\n* Add `excluded_methods` configuration option to `unneeded_override` to opt out checking methods with a given name.\r\n  For example, this helps avoid a conflict with `balanced_xctest_lifecycle` where one of `setUp/tearDown`\r\n  is empty but the other is not.  \r\n  [jaredgrubb](https://github.com/jaredgrubb)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issue referencing the Tests package from another Bazel workspace.  \r\n  [jszumski](https://github.com/jszumski)\r\n\r\n* Fix crash when a disable command is preceded by a unicode character.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5945](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5945)\r\n\r\n* Allow severity of `duplicate_imports` rule to be configurable.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5978](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5978)\r\n\r\n* Silence `no_magic_numbers` rule in conditions of `#if` directives.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#6000](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/6000)\r\n\r\n* Consider types restricting a protocol to classes in composed inherited types in `class_delegate_protocol` rule.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5982](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5982)\r\n\r\n* Rewrite `type_contents_order` rule with SwiftSyntax fixing an issue with experimental availability macros.  \r\n

Breaking\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Suggest failable `String(bytes:encoding:)` initializer in\r\n  `optional_data_string_conversion` rule as it accepts all `Sequence`\r\n  types.  \r\n  [Jordan Rose](https://github.com/jrose-signal)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Support reading files to lint from Input File Lists provided\r\n  by Run Script Build Phases in Xcode using the command-line\r\n  argument `--use-script-input-file-lists`.  \r\n  [BlueVirusX](https://github.com/BlueVirusX)\r\n\r\n* Adds a `lenient` configuration file setting, equivalent to the `--lenient`\r\n  command line option.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#5801](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5801)\r\n\r\n* Support type casting on configuration option values defined by environment variables.\r\n  Without a cast, these values would always be treated as strings leading to a potentially\r\n  invalid configuration.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5774](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5774)\r\n\r\n* Add new option `max_number_of_single_line_parameters` that allows only the specified maximum\r\n  number of parameters to be on one line when `allows_single_line = true`. If the limit is\r\n  exceeded, the rule will still trigger. Confusing option combinations like `allows_single_line = false`\r\n  together with `max_number_of_single_line_parameters > 1` will be reported.  \r\n  [kimdv](https://github.com/kimdv)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5781](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5781)\r\n\r\n* The `redundant_type_annotation` rule gains a new option,\r\n  `ignore_properties`, that skips enforcement on members in a\r\n  type declaration (like a `struct`). This helps the rule coexist with\r\n  the `explicit_type_interface` rule that requires such redundancy.  \r\n  [jaredgrubb](https://github.com/jaredgrubb)\r\n  [#3750](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3750)\r\n\r\n* Allow inherited isolation parameter to be first in function signatures\r\n  depending on the new option `ignore_first_isolation_inheritance_parameter`\r\n  which is `true` by default.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5793](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5793)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Run command plugin in whole package if no targets are defined in the\r\n  package manifest.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5787](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5787)\r\n\r\n* Silence `superfluous_else` rule on `if` expressions with only a single\r\n  availability condition.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5833](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5833)\r\n\r\n* Stop triggering the `control_statement` rule on closures being directly\r\n  called as conditions.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5846](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5846)\r\n\r\n* Do not trigger `self_in_property_initialization` rule on `self` in\r\n  key paths expressions.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5835](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5835)\r\n\r\n* Allow to specify transitive modules to be taken into account by\r\n  `unused_import` rule. This avoids that required imports are removed.  \r\n  [Paul Taykalo](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5167](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5167)\r\n\r\n* Only pass cache path and directory paths to commands that accept these arguments\r\n  in the command plugin.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#5848](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5848)\r\n\r\n* Do not throw deprecation warning if deprecated property is not\r\n  presented in configuration.  \r\n  [chipp](https://github.com/chipp)\r\n  [#5791](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5791)\r\n\r\n* The `prefer_type_checking` rule will no longer trigger for non-optional\r\n  type casting (`as`), or for comparisons to optional types.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#5802](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5802)\r\n\r\n* Fixes an issue where the `superfluous_disable_command` rule could generate\r\n  false positives for nested disable commands for custom rules.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#5788](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5788)\r\n\r\n* Fixes the `--only-rule` command line option, when a default `.swiftlint.yml`\r\n  is absent. Additionally rules specified with `--only-rule` on the command\r\n  line can now be disabled in a child configuration, to allow specific\r\n  directories to be excluded from the rule (or from being auto-corrected by\r\n  the rule), and `--only-rule` can now be specified multiple times\r\n  to run multiple rules.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n

Breaking\n\n* Hide all `Reporter`s from SwiftLint's' public interface.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* The options `inlcuded`, `name` and `message` are from now on ignored in the\n  configuration for the `private_unit_test` rule. The option `regex` is still\n  supported but is deprecated. It's recommended to use the list\n  `test_parent_classes` instead which accepts names of parent test classes.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Remove support for disable and enable commands in multiline comments.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#4798](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4798)\n\n#### Experimental\n\n* None.\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n* Show specific violation message for the `attributes` rule when the option\n  `always_on_line_above` or `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above`\n  is involved.  \n  [chrisngabp](https://github.com/chrisngabp)\n  [5103](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5103)\n\n* Rewrite `control_statement` rule using SwiftSyntax.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add new `non_overridable_class_declaration` rule that triggers on `class`\n  function and variable declarations in final classes that are not final\n  themselves or private.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* The Homebrew formula for SwiftLint now also installs completion scripts for\n  Bash, Zsh and fish.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add new `private_swiftui_state_property` opt-in rule to encourage setting\n  SwiftUI `@State` and `@StateObject` properties to private.  \n  [mt00chikin](https://github.com/mt00chikin)\n  [#3173](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3173)\n\n* The `implicit_return` rule now supports the kinds `subscript` and\n  `initializer` in the `included` configuration list.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `unneeded_override` rule to remove function overrides that only\n  call super.  \n  [keith](https://github.com/keith)\n  [5139](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/5139)\n\n* Show a rule's active YAML configuration in output of\n  `swiftlint rules <rule>`.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `invokeTest()` to `overridden_super_call` defaults.  \n  [DylanBettermannDD](https://github.com/DylanBettermannDD)\n\n* Add `--config-only` option to `rules` command allowing to print only the YAML\n  configuration of a single or all rules.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `--default-config` option to `rules` command allowing to use default\n  values for configurations being printed for a single rule or all rules.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `include_bare_init` option to the `explicit_init` rule. `include_bare_init`\n  encourages using named constructors over `.init()` and type inference.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5203](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5203)\n\n* Improved the reported location and reasons provided for issues\n  detected by the `invalid_seiftlint_command` rule.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5204](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5204)\n\n* 100 is no longer considered to be a magic number by the `no_magic_numbers`\n  rule.  \n

line option.\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5226](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5226)\n\n* Extend `implicitly_unwrapped_optional` rule with the new mode\n  `weak_except_iboutlets` that only checks `weak` variables.  \n  [Ricky Tan](https://github.com/rickytan)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* Respect grapheme clusters in counting the number of characters in the `collection_alignment` rule.  \n  [kishikawakatsumi](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi)\n  [#4837](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4837)\n\n* Fix false positive in `control_statement` rule that triggered on conditions\n  with trailing closures where parentheses are recommended by the compiler.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5135](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5135)\n\n* Fix runtime error when an excluded directory does not exist.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5078](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5078)\n\n* Support `switch` expressions used in expression contexts in\n  `switch_case_alignment` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5191](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5191)\n  [#5227](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5272)\n  [#5080](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5080)\n\n* Fix bug in `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule that triggered on\n  initializers of computed properties in classes when the property had an\n  accessor block.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5118](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5118)\n\n* Document `exclude_ranges` option for `number_separator` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Rewrite `implicit_return` rule with SwiftSyntax fixing a few false positives\n  and false negatives in the process.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5161](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5161)\n\n* Make sure `severity` is configurable for `type_contents_order` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Bazel: Mark `rules_xcodeproj` as a development dependency.  \n  [Thi Doãn](https://github.com/thii)\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\n

Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5120](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5120)\n\n* Fix some unexpected rule enablement interactions between parent and\n  child configurations.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#4876](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4876)\n\n* The `no_magic_numbers` rule will not trigger for violations in an\n  extension, if the extended class inherits from one of the specified\n  `test_parent_classes`, as long as the class declaration and the\n  extension are in the same source file.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5137](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5137)\n\n* Fix false positive in the `ns_number_init_as_function_reference` rule\n  when calling `NSNumber.init(value:)` directly.  \n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\n  [#5172](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5172)\n\n* The `no_magic_numbers` rule will not trigger for bitwise shift\n  operations.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5171](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5171)\n\n* The `accessibility_label_for_image` rule will no longer ignore the\n  `Image(systemName:)` constructor, as many system images do not\n  have good accessibility labels.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5165](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5165)\n\n* Fix false positives for `superfluous_disable_command` rule.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n

This\r\n  behavior can be turned off by setting `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above`\r\n  to `false.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4843](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4843)\r\n\r\n* The internal module structure for SwiftLint has changed to split the\r\n  monolithic `SwiftLintFramework` into new `SwiftLintCore` for core linter\r\n  infrastructure, `SwiftLintBuiltInRules` for built-in rules and\r\n  `SwiftLintExtraRules` to add your own native rules to SwiftLint.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Add new `superfluous_else` rule that triggers on `if`-statements when an\r\n  attached `else`-block can be removed, because all branches of the previous\r\n  `if`-block(s) would certainly exit the current scope already.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add `sorted_enum_cases` rule which warns when enum cases are not sorted.  \r\n  [kimdv](https://github.com/kimdv)\r\n\r\n* Add new `redundant_self_in_closure` rule that triggers in closures on\r\n  explicitly used `self` when it's actually not needed due to:\r\n  * Strongly captured `self` (`{ [self] in ... }`)\r\n  * Closure used in a struct declaration (`self` can always be omitted)\r\n  * Anonymous closures that are directly called (`{ ... }()`) as they are\r\n    definitly not escaping\r\n  * Weakly captured `self` with explicit unwrapping\r\n\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#59](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/59)\r\n\r\n* Extend `xct_specific_matcher` rule to check for boolean asserts on (un)equal\r\n  comparisons. The rule can be configured with the matchers that should trigger\r\n  rule violations. By default, all matchers trigger, but that can be limited to\r\n  just `one-argument-asserts` or `two-argument-asserts`.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [#3726](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3726)\r\n\r\n* Trigger `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule on more type references.  \r\n

[#4819](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4819)\r\n\r\n* Adds `test_parent_classes` option to the `no_magic_numbers` rule.\r\n  Violations within test classes will now be ignored by default.

[#4923](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4923)\r\n\r\n* The `attributes` rule received a new boolean option\r\n  `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above` which is `true` by default.\r\n  Setting it to `false` ensures that attributes with arguments like\r\n  `@Persisted(primaryKey: true)` don't violate the rule if they are on the same\r\n  line with the variable declaration.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4843](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4843)\r\n\r\n* Add new `unhandled_throwing_task` rule that triggers when a Task with an\r\n  implicit error type has unhandled trys or errors thrown inside its body.\r\n  This results in errors being silently discarded, which may be unexpected.\r\n  See this forum thread for more details: https://forums.swift.org/t/56066  \r\n  [kylebshr](https://github.com/kylebshr)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix `lower_acl_than_parent` rule rewriter by preserving leading whitespace.

Breaking\r\n\r\n* The `attributes` rule now expects attributes with arguments to be placed\r\n  on their own line above the declaration they are supposed to influence.\r\n  This applies to attributes with any kinds of arguments including single\r\n  key path arguments which were previously handled in a different way. This\r\n  behavior can be turned off by setting `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above`\r\n  to `false.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4843](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4843)\r\n\r\n* The internal module structure for SwiftLint has changed to split the\r\n  monolithic `SwiftLintFramework` into new `SwiftLintCore` for core linter\r\n  infrastructure, `SwiftLintBuiltInRules` for built-in rules and\r\n  `SwiftLintExtraRules` to add your own native rules to SwiftLint.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Add new `superfluous_else` rule that triggers on `if`-statements when an\r\n  attached `else`-block can be removed, because all branches of the previous\r\n  `if`-block(s) would certainly exit the current scope already.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Add `sorted_enum_cases` rule which warns when enum cases are not sorted.  \r\n  [kimdv](https://github.com/kimdv)\r\n\r\n* Add new `redundant_self_in_closure` rule that triggers in closures on\r\n  explicitly used `self` when it's actually not needed due to:\r\n  * Strongly captured `self` (`{ [self] in ... }`)\r\n  * Closure used in a struct declaration (`self` can always be omitted)\r\n  * Anonymous closures that are directly called (`{ ... }()`) as they are\r\n    definitly not escaping\r\n  * Weakly captured `self` with explicit unwrapping\r\n\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#59](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/59)\r\n\r\n* Extend `xct_specific_matcher` rule to check for boolean asserts on (un)equal\r\n  comparisons. The rule can be configured with the matchers that should trigger\r\n  rule violations. By default, all matchers trigger, but that can be limited to\r\n  just `one-argument-asserts` or `two-argument-asserts`.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [#3726](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3726)\r\n\r\n* Trigger `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule on more type references.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Adds a new `reporters` command, to improve discoverability of reporters.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#4819](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4819)\r\n\r\n* Adds `test_parent_classes` option to the `no_magic_numbers` rule.\r\n  Violations within test classes will now be ignored by default.  \r\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\r\n  [#4896](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4896)\r\n\r\n* Stop enforcing calls to super from the override functions `setUp()`,\r\n  `tearDown()`, `setUpWithError()`, and `tearDownWithError()` in `XCTestCase`\r\n  subclasses.  \r\n  [AndrewDMontgomery](https://github.com/andrewdmontgomery)\r\n  [#4875](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/4875)\r\n  \r\n* Prepend `warning: ` to error messages so that they show in Xcode.  \r\n  [whiteio](https://github.com/whiteio)\r\n  [#4923](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4923)\r\n\r\n* The `attributes` rule received a new boolean option\r\n  `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above` which is `true` by default.\r\n  Setting it to `false` ensures that attributes with arguments like\r\n  `@Persisted(primaryKey: true)` don't violate the rule if they are on the same\r\n  line with the variable declaration.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4843](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4843)\r\n\r\n* Add new `unhandled_throwing_task` rule that triggers when a Task with an\r\n  implicit error type has unhandled trys or errors thrown inside its body.\r\n  This results in errors being silently discarded, which may be unexpected.\r\n  See this forum thread for more details: https://forums.swift.org/t/56066  \r\n  [kylebshr](https://github.com/kylebshr)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix `lower_acl_than_parent` rule rewriter by preserving leading whitespace.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4860](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4860)\r\n\r\n* Ignore block comments in `let_var_whitespace` rule.  \r\n

This only impacts the programmatic API for the\r\n  SwiftLintFramework module.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* SwiftSyntax libraries have been updated from the previous 5.6 release and now\r\n  use the new parser written in Swift.\r\n  Swift 5.7+ features should now be parsed more accurately.\r\n  We've also measured an improvement in lint times of up to 15%.\r\n  This should also fix some deployment issues where the exact version of the\r\n  internal SwiftSyntax parser needed to be available.\r\n  If you notice any unexpected changes to lint results, please file an issue on\r\n  the SwiftLint issue tracker. We can look into it and if it's a SwiftSyntax\r\n  parser regression we can re-file it upstream.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [#4031](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4031)\r\n\r\n* Rewrite some rules with SwiftSyntax, fixing some false positives and catching\r\n  more violations:\r\n  -
