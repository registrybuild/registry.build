Breaking\n\n* Hide all `Reporter`s from SwiftLint's' public interface.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* The options `inlcuded`, `name` and `message` are from now on ignored in the\n  configuration for the `private_unit_test` rule. The option `regex` is still\n  supported but is deprecated. It's recommended to use the list\n  `test_parent_classes` instead which accepts names of parent test classes.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Remove support for disable and enable commands in multiline comments.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#4798](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4798)\n\n#### Experimental\n\n* None.\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n* Show specific violation message for the `attributes` rule when the option\n  `always_on_line_above` or `attributes_with_arguments_always_on_line_above`\n  is involved.  \n  [chrisngabp](https://github.com/chrisngabp)\n  [5103](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5103)\n\n* Rewrite `control_statement` rule using SwiftSyntax.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add new `non_overridable_class_declaration` rule that triggers on `class`\n  function and variable declarations in final classes that are not final\n  themselves or private.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* The Homebrew formula for SwiftLint now also installs completion scripts for\n  Bash, Zsh and fish.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add new `private_swiftui_state_property` opt-in rule to encourage setting\n  SwiftUI `@State` and `@StateObject` properties to private.  \n  [mt00chikin](https://github.com/mt00chikin)\n  [#3173](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3173)\n\n* The `implicit_return` rule now supports the kinds `subscript` and\n  `initializer` in the `included` configuration list.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `unneeded_override` rule to remove function overrides that only\n  call super.  \n  [keith](https://github.com/keith)\n  [5139](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/5139)\n\n* Show a rule's active YAML configuration in output of\n  `swiftlint rules <rule>`.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `invokeTest()` to `overridden_super_call` defaults.  \n  [DylanBettermannDD](https://github.com/DylanBettermannDD)\n\n* Add `--config-only` option to `rules` command allowing to print only the YAML\n  configuration of a single or all rules.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `--default-config` option to `rules` command allowing to use default\n  values for configurations being printed for a single rule or all rules.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Add `include_bare_init` option to the `explicit_init` rule. `include_bare_init`\n  encourages using named constructors over `.init()` and type inference.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5203](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5203)\n\n* Improved the reported location and reasons provided for issues\n  detected by the `invalid_seiftlint_command` rule.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5204](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5204)\n\n* 100 is no longer considered to be a magic number by the `no_magic_numbers`\n  rule.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5215](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5215)\n\n* Adds a `strict` configuration file setting, equivalent to the `--strict`\n  command line option.\n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5226](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5226)\n\n* Extend `implicitly_unwrapped_optional` rule with the new mode\n  `weak_except_iboutlets` that only checks `weak` variables.  \n  [Ricky Tan](https://github.com/rickytan)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* Respect grapheme clusters in counting the number of characters in the `collection_alignment` rule.  \n  [kishikawakatsumi](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi)\n  [#4837](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4837)\n\n* Fix false positive in `control_statement` rule that triggered on conditions\n  with trailing closures where parentheses are recommended by the compiler.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5135](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5135)\n\n* Fix runtime error when an excluded directory does not exist.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5078](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5078)\n\n* Support `switch` expressions used in expression contexts in\n  `switch_case_alignment` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5191](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5191)\n  [#5227](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5272)\n  [#5080](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5080)\n\n* Fix bug in `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule that triggered on\n  initializers of computed properties in classes when the property had an\n  accessor block.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5118](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5118)\n\n* Document `exclude_ranges` option for `number_separator` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Rewrite `implicit_return` rule with SwiftSyntax fixing a few false positives\n  and false negatives in the process.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5161](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5161)\n\n* Make sure `severity` is configurable for `type_contents_order` rule.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Bazel: Mark `rules_xcodeproj` as a development dependency.  \n  [Thi Doãn](https://github.com/thii)\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\n  [#4737](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4737)\n\n* Fix false negatives for the `unneeded_synthesized_initializer` rule\n  for nested structs in classes.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5120](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5120)\n\n* Fix some unexpected rule enablement interactions between parent and\n  child configurations.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#4876](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4876)\n\n* The `no_magic_numbers` rule will not trigger for violations in an\n  extension, if the extended class inherits from one of the specified\n  `test_parent_classes`, as long as the class declaration and the\n  extension are in the same source file.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5137](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5137)\n\n* Fix false positive in the `ns_number_init_as_function_reference` rule\n  when calling `NSNumber.init(value:)` directly.  \n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\n  [#5172](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5172)\n\n* The `no_magic_numbers` rule will not trigger for bitwise shift\n  operations.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5171](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5171)\n\n* The `accessibility_label_for_image` rule will no longer ignore the\n  `Image(systemName:)` constructor, as many system images do not\n  have good accessibility labels.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#5165](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5165)\n\n* Fix false positives for `superfluous_disable_command` rule.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n

This speeds up corrections significantly when\r\n  none of the rules use SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Add Swift Package Build Tool Plugin with support for Swift Packages\r\n  and Xcode projects.  \r\n  [Johannes Ebeling](https://github.com/technocidal)\r\n  [#3679](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3679)\r\n  [#3840](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3840)\r\n\r\n* Make `private_unit_test` rule correctable.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Disregard whitespace differences in `identical_operands` rule.

The default branch for the SwiftLint git repository will be renamed from\r\n`master` to `main` on September 1st. Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule\r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `closure_spacing` rule about 9x faster, finding some previously missed\r\n  cases and fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4090](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4090)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n* Enable (recursive) globs in `included` file paths.  \r\n  [sarastro-nl](https://github.com/sarastro-nl)\r\n\r\n* Custom rules are now broken down per rule instead of in aggregate in\r\n  `--benchmark`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `version` command now has an optional `--verbose` flag that prints out the\r\n  full version info, notably the build ID, which can be used to determine if two\r\n  `swiftlint` executables are identical.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Update documentation for `multiline_arguments_brackets` and\r\n  `multiline_literal_brackets` to make it immediately obvious that common\r\n  examples will trigger.  \r\n  [chrisjf](https://github.com/chrisjf)\r\n  [#4060](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4060)\r\n\r\n* The `--compile-commands` argument can now parse SwiftPM yaml files produced\r\n  when running `swift build` at `.build/{debug,release}.yaml`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Add new configuration option `allowed_no_space_operators` to\r\n  `operator_usage_whitespace` rule. It allows to specify custom operators which\r\n  shall not be considered by the rule.  \r\n  [imben123](https://github.com/imben123)\r\n\r\n* Add new protocols to remove some boilerplate involved in writing\r\n  SwiftSyntax-based rules.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n  [#4012](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4012)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `yoda_condition` rule by basing it on SwiftSyntax.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4081](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4081)\r\n\r\n* Fix false negatives in `first_where` rule when filtering array of dictionaries\r\n  with String keys.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n* Fix broken correction for `explicit_init` rule.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Using Bazel\r\n\r\nPut this in your

Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule\r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `closure_spacing` rule about 9x faster, finding some previously missed\r\n  cases and fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4090](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4090)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n* Enable (recursive) globs in `included` file paths.  \r\n  [sarastro-nl](https://github.com/sarastro-nl)\r\n\r\n* Custom rules are now broken down per rule instead of in aggregate in\r\n  `--benchmark`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `version` command now has an optional `--verbose` flag that prints out the\r\n  full version info, notably the build ID, which can be used to determine if two\r\n  `swiftlint` executables are identical.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Update documentation for `multiline_arguments_brackets` and\r\n  `multiline_literal_brackets` to make it immediately obvious that common\r\n  examples will trigger.  \r\n  [chrisjf](https://github.com/chrisjf)\r\n  [#4060](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4060)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n  [#4012](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4012)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `yoda_condition` rule by basing it on SwiftSyntax.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4081](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4081)\r\n\r\n* Fix false negatives in `first_where` rule when filtering array of dictionaries\r\n  with String keys.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n* Fix broken correction for `explicit_init` rule.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Using Bazel\r\n\r\nPut this in your

is a prerelease version. It won't be published to Homebrew or CocoaPods. But there are many other ways to install:\r\n\r\n* Downloading the attached `SwiftLint.pkg` installer and launching it\r\n* Downloading the attached `portable_swiftlint.zip` archive, extracting it and moving the binary from `portable_swiftlint/swiftlint` to `/usr/local/bin` or elsewhere in your `PATH`\r\n* Using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint): `mint install realm/SwiftLint@0.49.0-rc.1`\r\n* Cloning and building from source: `git clone https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git && cd SwiftLint && git checkout 0.49.0-rc.1 && make install`\r\n* Docker: ```docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:0.49.0-rc.1```\r\n* Bazel: See instructions at the bottom\r\n\r\nChanges from 0.48.0: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/compare/0.48.0...0.49.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Note: The default branch for the SwiftLint git repository will be renamed from\r\n`master` to `main` on September 1st. Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n  \r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule \r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n

is a prerelease version. It won't be published to Homebrew or CocoaPods. But there are many other ways to install:\r\n\r\n* Downloading the attached `SwiftLint.pkg` installer and launching it\r\n* Downloading the attached `portable_swiftlint.zip` archive, extracting it and moving the binary from `portable_swiftlint/swiftlint` to `/usr/local/bin` or elsewhere in your `PATH`\r\n* Using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint): `mint install realm/SwiftLint@0.47.0-rc.1`\r\n* Cloning and building from source: `git clone https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git && cd SwiftLint && git checkout 0.47.0-rc.1 && make install`\r\n* Docker: ```docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:0.47.0-rc.1```\r\n\r\nChanges from 0.46.5: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/compare/0.46.5...0.47.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.5 or higher to build.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `SwiftLintFramework` podspec has been removed. To our knowledge, this was\r\n  completely unused by other projects and was not worth the complexity needed\r\n  to justify its continued maintenance, especially in light of the integration\r\n  of SwiftSyntax. The `SwiftLint` podspec is still supported.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* The `force_cast` rule and the comment command parsing mechanism have been\r\n  updated to use SwiftSyntax instead of SourceKit. Please report any problems\r\n  you encounter by opening a GitHub issue. If this is successful, more rules may\r\n  use Swift Syntax in the future.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)"}]
