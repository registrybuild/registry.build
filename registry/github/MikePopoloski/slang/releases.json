Highlights\r\nThis release brings substantial elaboration performance improvements by way of instance caching, as well as more advanced linting capabilities with the new dataflow analysis framework.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Added support for clock flow, clock resolution, and clock inference rules in checkers and assertions\r\n  * Various cases of invalid clock usage will now issue appropriate errors\r\n  * Clock resolution is also performed for the sampled value system functions\r\n* Implemented rules for which kinds of sequences and properties can be declared in clocking blocks\r\n* Implemented rules for dynamic variable access from within checker procedures\r\n\r\n## Notable Breaking Changes\r\n* AST serialization no longer includes uninstantiated scopes in the output\r\n* `Driver::reportCompilation` method had part of its functionality split out into `Driver::reportDiagnostics` to allow for calling the new `Driver::runAnalysis` method in between. There is a new `Driver::runFullCompilation` method that wraps all of this for convenience if you don't care about controlling when each pass is done.\r\n* The `DEBUG` macro set for debug builds has been renamed to `SLANG_DEBUG`. `NDEBUG` is no longer used to conditionally control compilation, which should make it much less likely that using slang as a library will result in conflicting `NDEBUG` settings and causing ODR violations.\r\n* Warning control command line options have been reworked to make them less confusing. Settings for warning groups no longer override more explicit settings for a specific warning, and a bunch of confusing ordering dependence between `-Werror` and the other settings have been removed. This may cause changes to which warnings are enabled if your command line has a particularly constructed set of options. See the [documentation](https://sv-lang.com/command-line-ref.html#clr-warnings) for more information.\r\n* Tracking of net and variable drivers has moved to the new analysis layer. If you were using that portion of the AST API you'll need to change to get that information post-analysis.\r\n* The `--strict-driver-checking` flag has been removed. Its behavior can be regained by setting the new `--max-loop-analysis-steps` to 0.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* slang can now optionally use [cpptrace](https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace) (using the `SLANG_USE_CPPTRACE` CMake option) for better backtraces in the event of internal assertions or exceptions thrown\r\n* There is a new post-elaboration analysis pass in slang that does additional checking for enforcing specific language rules and reporting extra warnings. This can be disabled with the `--disable-analysis` flag, though it should not be needed unless there is a bug in slang.\r\n* Added a new option `--diag-abs-paths` to report diagnostics with absolute instead of relative file paths\r\n* Added [-Wmissing-return](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#missing-return) and [-Wincomplete-return](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#incomplete-return) which warn about non-void functions that do not return a value on all control paths\r\n* Added [-Wcase-unreachable](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-unreachable) for wildcard case items that are unreachable because they are completely subsumed by earlier items\r\n* Added [-Wcase-too-complex](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-too-complex) for case statements that are too complex to analyze, and `--max-case-analysis-steps` to control that limit\r\n* Added [-Wcase-incomplete](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-incomplete) for wildcard case statements that don't completely cover the input space and have no default case\r\n* Added [-Wcase-redundant-default](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-redundant-default) for case statements marked `unique` or `priority` that provide a default case\r\n* Added [-Wcase-wildcard-2state](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-wildcard-2state) for wildcard case statements that have 2-state conditions and items\r\n* The `` `celldefine `` directive is now exposed in the API and in AST serialization (thanks to @whitequark)\r\n* Added new flags `--all-deps`, `--include-deps`, `--module-deps`, and `--depfile-target` to allow outputting various dependency file lists from slang (thanks to @AndrewNolte)\r\n* Added [-Winferred-latch](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#inferred-latch) which detects signals that are not assigned on all control paths through `always_comb` blocks\r\n* Added [-Winferred-comb](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#inferred-comb) which detects combinational logic in `always_latch` blocks\r\n* Added new flag `--disallow-refs-to-unknown-instances` which causes errors to be issued when there are hierarchical references to ignored unknown module instances that were allowed via the existing `--ignore-unknown-modules` flag\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* slang now performs instance caching by default, which means duplicate instance bodies will not be visited during elaboration, which can greatly speed up elaboration times for large projects. This behavior can be disabled with the `--disable-instance-caching` flag, though it should not be needed unless there's a bug in slang -- please open an issue if you find that you need the flag.\r\n* -Wint-bool-conv now applies to expressions used in assertions, properties, and sequences\r\n* The -G option can now set parameter values hierarchically, and the value can be an expression that uses package members such as enum values\r\n* Hierarchical path strings for members of generic class types now include the specialization parameter values\r\n* Instance array port slicing of packed types has been reworked. Each instance's port connection now has an expression tree selecting the appropriate bits of the potentially multi-dimensional packed type.\r\n* `+libext` has been added as an alias for `--libext`\r\n* slang can now build for WASI targets (thanks to @whitequark)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed argument binding for sequence and property instances when using named arguments\r\n* Concurrent assertion and procedural checker statements are now correctly disallowed from appearing in subroutines and final blocks\r\n* Fixed a place where empty argument names were not correctly allowed in function prototype declarations\r\n* Fixed serialized AST locations that come from macro expansions (thanks to @micron-ian)\r\n* Fixed various issues with how instance array indices are mapped to underlying elements\r\n* Assignments are now correctly disallowed in timing controls\r\n* Cycle delays are now correctly disallowed in event trigger statements\r\n* The global future sampled value system functions are now correctly disallowed in assertions with sequence match items\r\n* Fixed some confusing behavior with glob file patterns involving '.../'\r\n* Fixed a bug that could cause the ordering of packages provided to the compilation to affect whether names can be looked up correctly\r\n* Fixed an erroneous assert / error involving order of elaboration issues with virtual interface types\r\n* Fixed `--cmd-rename` when used with plus args\r\n\r\n## Tools & Bindings\r\n### pyslang\r\n* Added some initial documentation and an API reference for the Python bindings (thanks to @parker-research)\r\n* Added a bunch more tests for the Python bindings (thanks to @parker-research)\r\n* Added Python bindings for the SyntaxRewriter class (thanks to @parker-research)\r\n* Fixed several keep-alive lifetime issues with the Python bindings\r\n\r\n### slang-tidy\r\n* Added new flag `--dump-config` to dump possible configuration options to stdout and exit (thanks to @jameshanlon)\r\n* Printing check descriptions now includes the config key name (thanks to @jameshanlon)\r\n* Added a new port prefix rule, similar to the existing port suffix rule (thanks to @corco)\r\n* Added a new undriven range rule (thanks to @jameshanlon)\r\n* Fixed OnlyAssignedOnReset false positive with struct arrays and for loops\r\n* Fixed RegisterHasNoReset false positive for loop iterator variables\r\n* Added support for user specified severities on individual checks (thanks to @jameshanlon)\r\n\r\n### slang-netlist\r\n* The netlist tool has been removed from the repo -- it will be moved to its own standalone repo for further development\r\n\r\n### rewriter\r\n* The rewriter tool has gained a number of options that control how the file is rewritten, including whether macros and includes should be expanded or not (thanks to @AndrewNolte)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/236436023/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":6},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/220759959","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/220759959/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/220759959/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v8.1","id":220759959,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBNILXc4NKIeX","tag_name":"v8.1","target_commitish":"release/8.1","name":"v8.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-05-24T01:26:49Z","updated_at":"2025-05-24T01:42:36Z","published_at":"2025-05-24T01:42:36Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/tarball/v8.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/zipball/v8.1","body":"This

Language Support\r\n* Disallow access to protected members from class scoped randomize constraint blocks -- the LRM is unclear about this but other tools seem to have decided this way made the most sense\r\n* Added a check that net aliases aren't duplicated, and that nets don't alias to themselves, as mandated by the LRM (thanks to @likeamahoney)\r\n* Implemented remaining rules for virtual interfaces:\r\n  * Virtual interfaces can't have hierarchical references to objects outside the interface\r\n  * Virtual interfaces can't have interface ports\r\n  * Instances assigned to a virtual interface can't have an instance configuration rule applied to them\r\n\r\n## Potentially Breaking Changes\r\n* The minimum supported Xcode version is now 16 and the minimum supported Clang version is now 17 (to allow cleaning up workarounds for various bugs)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* Added [-Wudp-coverage](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#udp-coverage) which warns about edge-sensitive user-defined primitives that don't specify an output state for all edges of all inputs (thanks to @likeamahoney)\r\n* Added [-Wpacked-array-conv](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#packed-array-conv) which warns for conversions between different multidimensional packed array types even if their overall bit width is the same\r\n* Added the [-Wparentheses](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#parentheses) warning group for diagnosing common precedence-related syntactical errors, which includes the following new warnings: [-Wbitwise-rel-precedence](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#bitwise-rel-precedence), [-Warith-in-shift](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#arith-in-shift), [-Wlogical-not-parentheses](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#logical-not-parentheses), [-Wbitwise-op-parentheses](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#bitwise-op-parentheses), [-Wlogical-op-parentheses](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#logical-op-parentheses), [-Wconditional-precedence](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#conditional-precedence), [-Wconsecutive-comparison](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#consecutive-comparison)\r\n* Added [-Wcase-type](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-type) to warn about case statements with mismatching types in their item expressions\r\n* Added [-Wcase-default](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-default) which warns about case statements that don't include a `default` label\r\n* Added [-Wcase-outside-range](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-outside-range) which warns for case items that can never be matched because they are outside the range of the case condition expression\r\n* Added [-Wcase-enum](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-enum) and [-Wcase-enum-explicit](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-enum-explicit) which warns about enum values that are missing from a case statement (with and without the presence of a `default` label, respectively)\r\n* Added [-Wcase-dup](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-dup) which warns about duplicate item expressions in a case statement\r\n* Added [-Wcase-overlap](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-overlap) which warns about overlapping case items (due to wildcard bits)\r\n* Added [-Wcase-not-wildcard](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#case-not-wildcard) and [-Wcasez-with-x](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#casez-with-x) which warn about potentially misleading wildcard bits in non-wildcard case statements\r\n* Added initial support for instance caching, which skips elaborating identical module instances to speed up elaboration. This is currently hidden behind the `--disable-instance-caching` command line flag because when turned on not all multi-driven errors are properly issued. Once all issues have been worked out the feature will be turned on by default.\r\n* Added the ability to output diagnostics to JSON instead of (or in addition to) plain text\r\n* Added `--translate-off-format` which allows specifying comment directives that should act as skipped regions (for example, `// pragma translate_off` and `// pragma translate_on`)\r\n* slang warnings can now be turned on and off within source code using `// slang lint_off` style comment directives\r\n* Added `--ast-json-detailed-types` to include detailed type information in AST JSON output\r\n* slang-tidy gained a `clkNameRegexString` option to control how clocks are named (thanks to @spomatasmd)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* Made -Wuseless-cast a bit less noisy -- it now does not warn about expressions involving genvars or cases where types are matching but one or the other has a different typedef alias name\r\n* -Wsign-compare no longer warns about expressions involving genvars\r\n* -Wvector-overflow no longer warns about signed literals with binary, octal, or hex bases that place a bit in the MSB\r\n* Made some build tweaks to support hermetic builds (thanks to @cc10512)\r\n* Added support for unions to slang-reflect (thanks to @Sustrak)\r\n* Changed the error issued for sequences that can never be matched to be a warning instead (-Wseq-no-match) and added additional context to the diagnostic message\r\n* Made minor tweaks to improve defparam and bind resolution performance\r\n* -Wsign-conversion will no longer warn for certain system functions that have a return type of `int` but in practice only return a single bit result\r\n* Made some minor improvements to parser error recovery when struct definitions are missing a closing brace\r\n* Inline genvars declared in generate loops are now included in the generate loop's members list when serializing the AST\r\n* The pyslang packaging build is now done in this repo instead of a separate downstream repo (thanks to @parker-research)\r\n* pyslang wheels now include support for arm64 (thanks to @gadfort)\r\n* Documentation now includes the READMEs for the various ancillary slang tools\r\n* Added stub generation to the Python distribution (thanks to @parker-research)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed a bug with constant evaluation of left-hand side assignment patterns that require implicit conversions to be applied\r\n* Fixed the locations returned by Trivia::getExplicitLocation for nested trivia involving directives (thanks to @povik)\r\n* Fixed checking of illegal property negation operator when used within recursive property instantiations (thanks to @likeamahoney)\r\n* Fixed a bug with serializing UninstantiatedDef AST nodes that use implicit named port connections\r\n* Fixed a crash when checking duplicate drivers in assignments to invalid ranges of a vector\r\n* Correctly allow unpacked unions to be used in equality and conditional expressions\r\n* Fixed spurious warnings inside an unused generic class that instantiates the default specialization of itself\r\n* Fixed Python bindings build to work with Python 3.13 (thanks to @vowstar)\r\n* Fixed a spurious error when assigning the empty queue to an unresolved / unknown typed variable\r\n* Correctly disallow override specifiers on class constructor declarations\r\n* Correctly report an error for unbased unsized literals that use a `?` instead of a `z` character for high impedance\r\n* Fixed handling of connections of interface arrays to ports with different declared dimensions\r\n* Fixed a bug in constant evaluation of packed struct member access\r\n* Correctly disallow select expressions of a parenthesized subexpression\r\n* Fixed a bug where some type declarations in two modules with different parameter values

Highlights\r\nThis release adds support for SystemVerilog configurations, which was the last major language feature missing from slang. There are now only a handful of minor issues remaining before slang's SystemVerilog implementation can be declared 100% complete -- see the [lang-compliance](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alang-compliance) issue label for known issues.\r\n\r\nAlso this release begins adding support for the changes made in the newly released IEEE 1800-2023 version of the SystemVerilog LRM. The remaining work on this will likely be completed in the next slang release. The changes in this (the 6.0) release are documented below in two categories; \"clarifications\" are changes that apply automatically to all code, whereas \"new features\" require use of the new `--std` command line flag to enable.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Added `--allow-bare-value-param-assigment` (included in 'vcs' compat mode) to allow a non-standard module instantiation syntax where a single parameter value can be supplied without including parentheses\r\n* Added `--allow-self-determined-stream-concat` (included in 'vcs' compat mode) to allow the use of streaming concatenation expressions in self-determined contexts (instead of just in assignments)\r\n* Added `--allow-multi-driven-locals` (included in 'vcs' compat mode) to allow subroutine local variables to be driven by multiple always_ff / always_comb blocks\r\n* Added full support for SystemVerilog libraries and configurations\r\n* Added support for equality comparisons between virtual interfaces and actual interface instances (thanks to @likeamahoney)\r\n* Ref args are now correctly disallowed in fork-join_any and join_none blocks\r\n* Wildcard port connections now correctly avoid importing new symbols into a scope via wildcard imports\r\n* Added support for referencing interface instances in unpacked array concatenations involving virtual interface arrays\r\n### Clarifications in IEEE 1800-2023\r\n* Unsized integer literals can be any bit width, not just capped at 32 bits.\r\n* Unpacked unions are allowed as net types\r\n* Time literals should be scaled but *not* rounded to the current time precision\r\n* Multiline block comments are allowed in macro definitions\r\n* Set membership operations (case statements, inside operator) always allow unbounded literals\r\n* Unbounded literals can only be assigned to parameters with simple bit vector types\r\n* $cast arguments don't need to be singular at compile time\r\n* Checking for multi-driven variables in subroutines invoked from always_comb/_latch/_ff doesn't apply to tasks, only functions\r\n* Non-blocking assignments to elements of dynamic arrays are not allowed\r\n* Static casts are assignment-like contexts\r\n* Tagged union expressions must be primaries only (binary expressions are not allowed)\r\n* Severity system tasks should work in constant functions (and behave as elaboration-time tasks)\r\n### New Features in IEEE 1800-2023\r\n* Triple quoted (multiline) string literals\r\n* Macro stringification with triple quoted strings\r\n* Type parameters and the type() operator can now refer to incomplete forward typedefs\r\n* Type parameters can now specify a type restriction just like forward typedefs\r\n* The `timescale directive is disallowed inside design elements\r\n* Boolean expressions in conditional directives (ifdef, ifndef)\r\n* Function call expressions can be chained (slang already supported this but several issues related to it were fixed)\r\n* `type(this)` is now allowed in static contexts within class declarations\r\n* Soft packed unions\r\n* The `index` method of array iterators can be renamed via an argument to the method call\r\n* Unpacked arrays have a built-in `map` method\r\n* Classes can be declared `final`\r\n* Class constructor argument lists and `extends` argument lists can be declared `default`\r\n* Class methods can be declared `initial`, `extends`, and `final`\r\n* Added the `weak_reference` built-in class\r\n* Interface classes can be declared within other classes\r\n* The built-in `process` class is declared `final`\r\n* Value ranges gain new absolute / relative tolerance operators\r\n* `ref static` subroutine arguments\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* Added [-Wmultibit-edge](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#multibit-edge) (on by default) to warn about clock edge triggers on multibit expressions\r\n* Added [-Wint-bool-conv](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#int-bool-conv) and [-Wfloat-bool-conv](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#float-bool-conv) to warn about multibit integer and floating point expressions used in a boolean context\r\n* Added [-Wuseless-cast](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#useless-cast) to warn about explicit casts to the same type as the underlying expression\r\n* Added [-Wunknown-sys-name](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#unknown-sys-name) to allow downgrading the error that occurs when referencing an unknown system task or function\r\n* Added [compilation unit listings](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#unit-listing) to allow fine grained control over how sources are parsed into separate compilation units (including separating macro defines and include directories on a per-unit basis)\r\n* Added `--defaultLibName` to control the name of the default source library\r\n* Added `--std` to choose which version of the LRM slang should conform to.

Support is incomplete and may be buggy.\r\n* Index selects after range/part selects are now disallowed, to conform to the LRM as well as match the behavior of other tools\r\n* An error is now issued for interface ports that connect hierarchically through a generate or instance array, as mandated by the LRM\r\n* An error is now issued for generic interface ports that are connected via a wildcard connection, as mandated by the LRM\r\n* Rules about where classes with private members are allowed to be used in bitstream casts are now enforced\r\n* Relaxed requirement that DPI import declarations have an explicit return type to match behavior of other tools\r\n* Added `-Wdpi-pure-task` to allow downgrading the error that DPI import tasks cannot be marked `pure`\r\n* Added `--relax-string-conversions` (included in \"vcs\" compat mode) to allow strings to implicitly convert to integers\r\n* Added `--allow-recursive-implicit-call` to allow implicit call expressions to be recursive function calls for compatibility with other tools\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* Minimum required compiler versions have been bumped to GCC 11, clang 16, and Xcode 15 (should be the last bump for a while)\r\n* Minimum required cmake version has been bumped to 3.20\r\n* Added `--allow-toplevel-iface-ports` to allow top level modules that have interface ports\r\n* Added [-Wconstant-conversion](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#constant-conversion) which warns about conversions inside constant expressions that lose information\r\n* Added [-Wsign-conversion](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#sign-conversion) which warns about implicit integral conversions that change sign\r\n* Added a `-L` option to control the default [source library](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#source-libraries) search order\r\n* The `--diag-hierarchy` option now takes a parameter of \"always\", \"never\", or \"auto\" to allow forcing or hiding instance paths in diagnostics\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* Made several improvements to -Wimplicit-conv to make it less noisy\r\n* Cleaned up internal code related to wide character support for Windows. slang now relies on the relatively new utf-8 code page support in Windows; this does mean that Unicode paths will now only be handled correctly on or after Windows Version 1903 (May 2019 Update).\r\n* The maximum size of a type has been increased to 2^31 bytes (which matches VCS)\r\n* The `--suppress-warnings` feature has been optimized to not perform unnecessary filesystem operations\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed a case where -Wimplicit-conv would not be issued for mismatching struct types\r\n* Fixed a crash when $static_assert condition is parenthesized\r\n* Fixed the count of compilation errors reported when using -Werror along with `--suppress-warnings`\r\n* Fixed -Wvector-overflow to work correctly with signed literals\r\n* Fixed the type infered for parameters that are assigned vector literals larger than 32-bits wide\r\n* SystemVerilog class types (and other types that contain them) are now limited to the max object size supported by slang (the same limit for structs and arrays that was already present)\r\n* Fixed a few places where large types or expressions could result in internal overflow of variables tracking their sizes, which could cause crashes or other strange behavior. Now a proper error is issued.\r\n* A proper error is now issued for duplicate local variables inside of properties and sequences\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to connect an extern subroutine implementation to an interface array port\r\n* Fixed a spurious error about signals being multi-driven from uninstantiated generate blocks\r\n* Fixed a spurious error when streaming concatenations are used in port connections of uninstantiated modules\r\n* An appropriate parse error is now issued for generate blocks that are missing a body\r\n* Fixed a crash when classes with cycles in their members are used in a cast expression\r\n* Fixed a bug in parsing parameter ports when their type was explicitly package scoped and the parameter keyword was elided\r\n* Fixed a bug in the slang driver that prevented showing instance paths in diagnostics\r\n* An error is now issued for invalid use of the unique and priority keywords in `else` blocks\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @alexeyvoh made their first contribution in https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/pull/856\r\n* @Badhi made their first contribution in https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/pull/858\r\n* @likeamahoney made their first contribution in https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/pull/861\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/compare/v4.0...v5.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/135108332/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":3},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/115930822","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/115930822/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/115930822/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v4.0","id":115930822,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBNILXc4G6PbG","tag_name":"v4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v4.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-08-10T13:35:10Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T13:38:37Z","published_at":"2023-08-10T13:38:37Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/tarball/v4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/zipball/v4.0","body":"## Language Support\r\n* Finished full support for user-defined primitives by adding error checking for table entries\r\n* Support for whitespace between the two characters of the dist weight operators has been added for compatibility with other tools -- this is an error by default but can be downgraded as needed. See [-Wsplit-distweight-op](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#split-distweight-op).\r\n* Added support for net aliases\r\n* Added support for checkers\r\n* Added support for extern modules/interfaces/programs/primitives, along with wildcard port lists in declaration headers\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* slang now requires a C++20 compatible compiler to build (e.g. minimum GCC 10)\r\n* New warnings [-Wport-width-expand](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#port-width-expand) and [-Wport-width-trunc](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#port-width-trunc) separate out width warnings that occur in port connections from general expressions elsewhere. This makes it easier to find and target these specific cases of width mismatches.\r\n* New option `--suppress-macro-warnings` that functions similarly to `--suppress-warnings` except that it applies to the original definition location of macros instead of their expansion location. This is useful if, for example, you want to hide warnings from 3rd party macros (like from UVM) that you use in your own code.\r\n* A new experimental tool called `slang-netlist` has been added (thanks to @jameshanlon) -- see the [readme](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/blob/master/tools/netlist/README.md) for more details\r\n* A new experimental tool called `slang-reflect` has been added (thanks to @Sustrak) -- see the [readme](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/tree/master/tools/reflect/README.md) for more details\r\n* The slang build optionally supports obtaining dependencies via [conan.io](https://conan.io/) -- see [the docs](https://sv-lang.com/building.html#dependencies) for details.\r\n* The slang driver now accepts [file patterns](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#file-patterns) to make it easier to select groups of files\r\n* Initial support for [source libraries](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#source-libraries) and library map files has been added. This is only for specifying input files right now but in future releases will be expanded to work with SystemVerilog config declarations.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* When dealing with duplicate module/interface/program definitions (where the error has been downgraded to a warning) slang will now make use of the first definition seen instead of any later ones, to better match the behavior of other tools\r\n* Improved the warnings issued for unused 'inout' ports\r\n* Macros declared in slang headers have been namespaced to avoid polluting user code\r\n* Several hash table implementations used by slang (ska::flat_hash_map, unordered_dense, StringTable) have been removed and consolidated into using boost::unordered. The library includes a minimal boost_unordered.hpp header to avoid needing to depend on all of boost.\r\n* Added a dependency on the mimalloc custom allocator (can be disabled if desired)\r\n* A number of small optimizations (including the switch to boost::unordered and use of mimalloc) combine to improve general slang compilation performance by about 10%\r\n* slang can now build correctly with exceptions and RTTI disabled, to allow integration with other codebases that disable use of these features\r\n* The slang driver will now parse input files in multiple threads by default. This can be disabled with `--threads=1`. This feature is not supported when using `--single-unit`.\r\n* The `--libdir` feature will now search for files based on interface port declarations in addition to module instantiations (thanks to @AndrewNolte)\r\n* Support for visitors has been added to the Python bindings (thanks to @tdp2110)\r\n* Low-level file loading routines in slang have been rewritten to use platform-level APIs. This should slightly improve performance, but more importantly it allows slang to report system-specific error messages when file loading fails.\r\n* Failed file loads invoked via the Python bindings now raise an appropriate Python exception\r\n* The `--suppress-warnings` option has been changed to take a file pattern instead of a directory path prefix. Existing uses of this flag will need to be updated to the new behavior.\r\n* Most command line arguments that accept multiple values now accept those values as a comma-separated list in addition to repeating the argument multiple times\r\n* slang can now read input from stdin by specifying a file named '-'\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented indexing into an interface array when accessing that array hierarchically\r\n* break and continue statements are now correctly disallowed from controlling a loop outside of a fork-join block\r\n* Duplicate driver checking now applies to signals accessed via modports\r\n* Subroutine ports with initializers will now issue an appropriate error\r\n* Subroutine argument default values are now checked for the correct direction and count as drivers for target symbols\r\n* Fixed messaging generated by elaboration system tasks when arguments are invalid\r\n* Fixed an off-by-one error in symbol lookup location for detecting whether parameters are used before they are declared\r\n* Fixed a few return value policies in the Python bindings that were incorrect\r\n* Fixed a bug where a continuous assign statement that referenced an implicit net more than once would cause an error about duplicate net declarations\r\n* Fixed the use of the $global_clocking system functions in direct event controls\r\n* Fixed an erroneous diagnostic when checking which kinds of expressions are allowed in a binary `and` or `or` property expression\r\n* Fixed parsing of tagged patterns when followed immediately by a `&&&` predicate\r\n* Added tests and fixed resulting issues found in AST serialization and visitation methods\r\n* The Compilation constructor now ensures it safely only adds type diagnostic printing callbacks once, to allow multithreaded use of separate Compilation objects\r\n* Fixed the error message reported for -Wimplicit-port-type-mismatch -- it was reporting the wrong types involved\r\n* Fixed parsing of parameter ports that have multiple declarators -- previously later parameters in the list were not being associated with the prior type declaration\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @daglem made their

Highlights\r\nAs of this release slang passes 100% of the tests at https://github.com/chipsalliance/sv-tests (the only tool able to do so).\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Added support for specify module timing paths\r\n* Added support for specify pulsestyle and showcancelled directives\r\n* Added support for `PATHPULSE$` specparams\r\n* Added support for system timing checks\r\n* Added support for program namespacing rules\r\n* Added support for anonymous programs\r\n* Added support for DPI open array typed arguments\r\n* Added support for `$inferred_clock` and `$inferred_disable`\r\n* Finished full support for bind directives\r\n* Finished full support for defparams\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* New option `--obfuscate-ids` when used with `--preprocess` will replace all identifiers in the output with obfuscated alphanumeric strings (thanks to @Sustrak)\r\n* Added a group of new warnings to report on unused code elements; see [-Wunused](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#unused)\r\n* A new (currently experimental) tool, `slang-tidy`, has been added as a place to collect more in-depth or project-specific static analysis rules (thanks to @Sustrak).\r\n* New option `--suppress-warnings` allows suppressing warnings from one or more file paths, intended to allow easily hiding warnings from 3rd party code\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* The default library name for slang has been changed to \"libsvlang\" to avoid clashing with an existing \"S-lang\" package on most Linux systems. The library name is now configurable via CMake.\r\n* Errors about unknown package names are now ignored in lint-only mode\r\n* Drastically improved the performance of overlapping driver checking and driver loop unrolling. For large projects this may reduce compile times by as much as 80-90%.\r\n* Net charge strength and drive strength have been added to the AST\r\n* Added human-friendly names for function arguments in Python bindings (thanks to @Kuree)\r\n* Conditional statements in constant functions now implement unique/priority semantics (thanks to @HungMingWu)\r\n* Procedural force/release of bit selects or part selects is an error according to the LRM; this error can now be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools (thanks to @udif)\r\n* Implicit named port connections with inequivalent types are disallowed by the LRM; this error can now be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools\r\n* When printing type names in diagnostics, if more than one type shares the same simple name, they will now be disambiguated with their full path\r\n* A new `--timescale` option allows setting a default time scale for design elements. If this option is not set, there is no default and an error will be\r\nissued if not all elements have a time scale specified (as required by the LRM).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Parameters used inside specify blocks will now issue an appropriate warning\r\n* Fixed an issue where the parser erroneously allowed selects of integer literal expressions\r\n* Top-level programs are now automatically instantiated, just like top-level modules\r\n* Implicit covergroups declared inside classes were previously not being checked for correctness\r\n* Fixed parser handling of spacing within `always@( *)` statements being misinterpreted as a closing attribute token (thanks to @godblesszhouzhou)\r\n* Fixed a bug in the lookup location used for non-ansi port symbol attribute expressions\r\n* Fixed `-Werror` to actually work\r\n* Tweaked handling of unbased unsized literals to reduce false-positive width warnings\r\n* Changed scoped access to incomplete forward typedefs to be allowed as long as the final name in the chain is not a type (matches behavior of other tools)\r\n* The parser now correctly disallows attributes on assignment operators\r\n* References to compilation unit items from within packages is now correctly disallowed\r\n* Hierarchical references from packages to items outside that package are now correctly disallowed\r\n* Bit-vector system functions (such as `$countbits`) can now be used with bitstream types (as opposed to just integral types)\r\n* Max size limits for packed and unpacked arrays and structs are now strictly enforced\r\n* Invalid inferred time scales will now issue an appropriate error\r\n* Fixed a bug in arithmetic of large constants at compile time (thanks to @adream307)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @paulsc96 made their first

Highlights\r\nThis release focuses on making slang much more usable as a library. There's been a large amount of refactoring\r\nand reorganizing to make usage more straightforward. The CMake build was rewritten, and documentation showing how to\r\nintegrate the library has been improved. Python bindings have been added to make it easy to use slang in scripts and tools.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Added support for modport port expressions\r\n* Added support for modport exports and `extern` interface methods (including the rules for `extern forkjoin` methods)\r\n* Directionality of modport ports is now enforced (e.g. assigning to an input modport port is now an error)\r\n* Added full support for SystemVerilog's pattern matching feature, including usage in constant expressions\r\n* Added parsing support for config declarations\r\n* The parser now enforces syntax rules around specify block edge descriptors\r\n* Port connection slicing across arrays of instances is now also allowed with implicit port connections\r\n* Access to static class data members via an incomplete forward typedef is now allowed\r\n* Compile-time constant out-of-bounds element and range selects have always been an error in slang. The LRM allows for them to either be an error or optionally to result in `'x` and compilation to continue -- to support this option the resulting errors have been changed to suppressible warnings (though still set to errors by default).\r\n* `` `pragma protect`` directives are now validated for correctness and encoded text is now decoded by slang (in all four decoding formats mentioned by the LRM). Actual encrypted text is not decrypted but just skipped instead -- it's very unlikely any IP vendor will ever provide slang with a decryption key so there's little point in implementing it.\r\n* Duplicate module / interface / program / primitive definitions have been made a suppressible error to support legacy workflows (thanks to @udif)\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* New warning: [-Wempty-body](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#empty-body) (on by default) warns about likely accidental usage of semicolons after a loop or if condition that causes the body to be empty\r\n* New warning: [-Wreversed-range](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#reversed-range) (on by default) warns about a reversed open range that will behave as if it's an empty set instead\r\n* Added [Python bindings](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/pyslang) for the library\r\n* Driver code has been factored out of the slang-driver tool into a [Driver class](https://sv-lang.com/classslang_1_1driver_1_1_driver.html) that can be consumed by users of the library that are creating their own frontend tools\r\n* slang now treats all input source files as being UTF-8 encoded. Previously slang required all sources to be ASCII encoded but did not strictly enforce that, and could behave incorrectly when encountering non-ASCII characters. Now all characters are validated and UTF-8 sequences are handled correctly (and are allowed without issue inside string literals and code comments). Invalid UTF-8 sequences are diagnosed and a warning will be issued.\r\n* The default set of warnings was tweaked - some were added and some removed. See the [Warning Reference](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html) for more information about which are on by default.\r\n* The `--libraries-inherit-macros` flag was added to allow macros defined in primary source files to bleed over into automatically loaded library files. The `--single-unit` option must also be used when providing this option.\r\n* New options `--cmd-ignore` and `--cmd-rename` can be used when you have existing command files with option flags designed for another tool to process (thanks to @udif)\r\n* New option `--ignore-directive` can be used to ignore vendor-specific preprocessor directives that would otherwise cause slang to flag an error (thanks to @udif)\r\n* Added `--time-trace` to profile where slang is spending its compilation time\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* slang now reports a better error when you forget to put parenthesis after a module or interface instantiation\r\n* Lots of internal code cleanup, static analysis and lint fixes, and cleanup of TODOs in this release\r\n* Large integers printed in diagnostics will now be abbreviated to avoid filling the console with tons of digits\r\n* Added a limit to the size of instance arrays, to avoid hangs and running out of memory when typos produce huge array sizes. Use `--max-instance-array` if you run into the limit in a real design.\r\n* Made several improvements to parser error recovery to cover common coding errors\r\n* Several improvements were made to the SyntaxVisitor and SyntaxRewriter helper classes (thanks to @HungMingWu)\r\n* Many improvements were made to the cmake build and installation flow. slang should be much more easily consumed as a library in downstream projects.\r\n* Wrote more documentation and improved the doc build and its presentation\r\n* A lot of code was reorganized internally into more easily discovered locations. Library code is now organized into namespaces.\r\n* slang should now build correctly as a shared library out of the box\r\n* Made several minor optimizations across the library that should add up to about 10-15% compilation speed improvement for typical workflows\r\n* The minimum compiler version for slang was bumped to GCC 9. This will move to GCC 10 (and allow use of C++20 features) after the next release.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed ICE when a subroutine declaration refers to itself in its own return type declaration\r\n* Fixed several issues with Unicode path handling on Windows\r\n* Fixed a parser bug where a colon followed immediately by a line comment would be parsed incorrectly (thanks to @HungMingWu)\r\n* Fixed a parsing bug with `restrict property` statements\r\n* Fixed several crashes and internal assertions in corner cases discovered by fuzz testing\r\n* Fixed a number of cases where a proper diagnostic in an error scenario would be followed by one or more spurious diagnostics -- now only the one proper diagnostic is issued\r\n* Fixed a number of cases where a diagnostic with a formatted message might put an empty string into that message, which was confusing and not helpful\r\n* Constraint blocks are now correctly disallowed outside of class declarations\r\n* The `$bits` system function can now correctly reference automatic variables from static initializers\r\n* Fixed struct member declarations that referred to other members in the same struct type as part of their type declaration\r\n* Fixed handling of defparams when there are infinitely recursive modules in the design\r\n* The macro list printed by `--macros-only` is now sorted for consistent ordering between runs\r\n* Fixed a bug where diagnostic pragmas were not correctly handled when found in automatically loaded library source files\r\n* Source files listed in command files are now processed strictly in order relative to files listed in other command files, which gives predictable behavior when treating them as a single unit\r\n* The check for maximum include stack depth was erroneously including all files in its count when using single-unit builds\r\n* Fixed a bug that could cause case statements in constant expression to be misevaluated under certain conditions\r\n* Fixed the inferred type of untyped parameters when initialized from an equivalent but not matching type expression\r\n* Fixed a bug in the parser that could misparse delayed statements after an event control expression","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/81454337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":2},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/70564685","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/70564685/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/70564685/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v1.0","id":70564685,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBNILXc4ENLtN","tag_name":"v1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-06-24T14:32:34Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T00:31:04Z","published_at":"2022-06-25T20:55:25Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/tarball/v1.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/zipball/v1.0","body":"## Highlights\r\nslang can now detect and enforce all of the various rules surrounding multiple drivers on nets, variables, and ports. This release also comes with support for functional coverage constructs, opt-in support for hierarchical names used within constant expressions, and some additional compatibility functionality to make it easier to use with codebases that primarily build with other, less-conformant tools.\r\n\r\nAs of this release, no pre-built binaries will be included. They were of limited usefulness and difficult to maintain and so it's not worth providing them -- build from the source release instead.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Added full support for covergroups, cover points, cover crosses, coverage bins and options.\r\n* Added support for untyped mailboxes.\r\n* Hierarchical references can now be used in constant expressions by passing the `--allow-hierarchical-const` flag. This is not strictly legal in SystemVerilog but other tools allow it and so slang supports it for compatibility.\r\n* Added support for non-ansi interface ports.\r\n* Added support for user-defined nettypes in module and interface port lists.\r\n* Added support for non-ansi \"multiports\" and sliced ports.\r\n* Added support for explicit ansi and non-ansi ports.\r\n* Added support for generic interface ports.\r\n* Added support for nested module and interface declarations.\r\n* Added the LRM rules for port collapsing of dissimilar net types.\r\n* Added rules around multiple drivers or mixed continuous and procedural drivers for variables and uwires.\r\n* Added rules for port connection directions (input vs output).\r\n* Added rules to disallow reading output clock variables or continuous assignments to the target of a clock variable.\r\n* Added rules to disallow assertion local variables from being driven by more than one output local variable formal argument.\r\n* Added rules about what timing controls are allowed in always_comb / always_latch / always_ff.\r\n* Added rules for user-defined nettype resolution functions.\r\n* Added LRM-specified warnings when net port coercion occurs.\r\n* Added full support for interconnect nets.\r\n* Added support for let declarations and nettypes inside of statement blocks.\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* A missing include directory passed to the driver tool is now a warning instead of an error.\r\n* A `--compat` flag was added to allow specifying general compatibility requirements with other tools. Currently only `vcs` is supported as a value. This enables a bunch of other flags to try to be compatible with VCS as much as possible.\r\n* `+incdir` and `+define` flags were added to increase compatibility with other tools.\r\n* Support for \"command files\" was added -- use the `-F` and `-f` flags to specify the path to a command file. Command files allow more conveniently specifying large lists of files and command line options to an invocation of the tool. See [Command Files](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#command-files) for more detail.\r\n* Added a $static_assert elaboration task that takes a condition and fails compilation if that condition is false. See [Nonstandard Built-In Functions](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#system-funcs) for an example.\r\n* Added a `--relax-enum-conversions` flag to do less strict type checking of enum conversions, for compatibility with other tools.\r\n* Integer literal overflow is now a warning instead of an error.\r\n* All warning flags are now documented with examples here: [Warning Reference](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html)\r\n* The `-Wno-top` warning flag was renamed to `-Wmissing-top` to avoid confusion with the -no prefix.\r\n* Added a `--allow-dup-initial-drivers` flag which allows duplicate drivers from initial blocks instead of causing an error, for compatibility with other tools.\r\n* By default, procedural `for` loops will be unrolled if possible before checking for duplicate driver errors. The LRM is actually more strict and does not allow this looser form of driver checking, so a `--strict-driver-checking` flag has been added to disable it. More details at [Driver Loop Unrolling](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#loop-unroll).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* A better error is reported when trying to hierarchically refer to a type name.\r\n* `$unit` based names are no longer erroneously considered hierarchical.\r\n* The coverage system functions now allow a standalone `$root` as an argument.\r\n* Finished a bunch of TODOs and corner case handling in port declarations.\r\n* Made several tweaks to the parser's error recovery to get better diagnostics for commonly made mistakes.\r\n* Fixed issues with non-ansi port declarations that used named types.\r\n* Port initializers are now correctly required to be constants.\r\n* The $dumpvars function is now allowed to dump nets as well.\r\n* Fixed ICE when exporting an imported enum member from a package.\r\n* Fixed the printing of hierarchical path names in diagnostics.\r\n* Fixed macro stringification of substituted string literals.\r\n* Parameters with unpacked dimensions are now allowed to have a partially inferred type (with a `logic` base element type).\r\n* Report an error for variables connected to `inout` ports.\r\n* Report an error for unconnected `ref` ports.\r\n* Top-level modules cannot have `ref` ports.\r\n* Fixed JSON serialization of method prototype arguments.\r\n* A better error is reported when trying to assign to a constant.\r\n* Correctly disallow `inout` uwire ports.\r\n* Fixed how subroutine argument types are inferred if not explicitly provided.\r\n* Fixed a bug that allowed some errors in class randomize lookups to go unreported.\r\n* Fixed a double reporting of errors when enums have an invalid base type.\r\n* Fixed selection of enum values that are members of a struct declaration.\r\n* Fixed type compatibility checking for types that share the same source syntax but live in different logical places in the hierarchy.\r\n* Report an error if there are cycles in a class inheritance chain.\r\n* Fixed the threshold for unrecoverable lexer errors to not include warnings in the count.\r\n* Fixed some corner cases where lvalues of system methods were not properly validated.\r\n* Correctly error if there are duplicate out-of-block class method definitions.\r\n* Correctly require for loop variable declarations to have initializers.\r\n* Fixed a few parsing corner cases for user-defined primitives.\r\n* Correctly disallow assertion local variables from being referenced in event expressions.\r\n* Fixed an incorrect implicit conversion of string literals inside of concatenation expressions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/70564685/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/56579863","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/56579863/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/56579863/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v0.9","id":56579863,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBNILXc4DX1cX","tag_name":"v0.9","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.9","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-01-04T13:20:23Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:53Z","published_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:53Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/assets/53381080","id":53381080,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBNILXc4DLofY","name":"slang-linux.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":5684526,"digest":null,"download_count":113,"created_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:47Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:49Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/download/v0.9/slang-linux.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/assets/53381074","id":53381074,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBNILXc4DLofS","name":"slang-macos.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":43854403,"digest":null,"download_count":16,"created_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T02:13:47Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/download/v0.9/slang-macos.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/assets/53381065","id":53381065,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBNILXc4DLofJ","name":"slang-windows.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https

Highlights\r\nThis release contains a lot of internal refactoring and cleanup, with the goals of correctly handling all corner cases as well as dramatically speeding up compilation time -- some projects and workloads may see up to a 10x speedup.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Support for intra-assignment timing controls\r\n* Full support for dynamic arrays in type checking and constant expressions\r\n* Full support for associative arrays in type checking and constant expressions\r\n* Partial support for queues in type checking and constant expressions (still missing expressions involving the '$' magic value)\r\n* Added $dimensions and $unpacked_dimensions system functions\r\n* Added $printtimescale, $timeformat, and $system functions\r\n* Added $ferror, $fgets, $fscanf, $sscanf, and $fread system functions\r\n* Support for disable statements\r\n* Support for unpacked array concatenations\r\n* Support for min:typ:max expressions\r\n* Support for disable-fork and wait-fork statements\r\n* String literals can now correctly be implicitly assigned to unpacked arrays of bytes (thanks to @thingkingland )\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* Reworked how definitions and instances are represented, both to make the code clearer as well as to allow caching of identical instances.\r\n* Timing controls are now included in AST->JSON serialization (thanks to @Kuree ).\r\n* Added initial support for generating simulation code for designs using LLVM. There's enough support here to simulate a basic \"Hello World\" example but not much else.\r\n* To facilitate code generation, a mid-level IR representation was added to sit between the AST and LLVM. In the future this could grow to be useful to other consumers as well.\r\n* Went through and removed experimental code analysis services from the repository and ported the CI build to GitHub actions, fixing the automated release and deployment pipeline in the process.\r\n* Split slang into several component libraries to make it easier to link in only subsets of functionality.\r\n* Added a bunch more API reference documentation.\r\n* The remaining 3rd party dependencies have been vendored into the repo under the external/ folder. The conan package manager has been removed from the build process.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fixed a bug where stringifying certain integer literals could produce garbage results.\r\n* Improved parser error recovery in more scenarios.\r\n* Fixed several crashes found by fuzz testing.\r\n* Empty concatenations now correctly report an error.\r\n* Fixed a faulty error reported when range-selecting a single bit from a big-endian vector.\r\n* Fixed the type that is inferred for implicitly typed parameters.\r\n* Rewrote lvalue handling in constant expressions to fix several corner cases.\r\n* Fixed a crash in the preprocessor involving a rare case of macro replacing a token that then becomes another macro.\r\n* Fixed parsing of cycle delays.\r\n* Fixed ANSI color output on Windows terminals.\r\n* Fixed variable lifetimes of task arguments.\r\n* Packed dimensions on enum declarations were previously being ignored.\r\n* Added additional error checking for various array creation rules.\r\n* Fixed an infinite loop in the parser caused by unsupported statements (thanks to @thingkingland ).\r\n* Fixed a bunch of issues with parsing new expressions.\r\n* Fixed a bunch of issues with parsing clocking blocks.\r\n* The error reported for non-standard character escape codes has been downgraded to a warning."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/24830889","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/24830889/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/24830889/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v0.3","id":24830889,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI0ODMwODg5","tag_name":"v0.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.3:

Highlights\r\nAs of this release the preprocessor is 100% complete. This does not mean bug free (though I hope so!) but rather that all known features are finished, all known bugs are fixed, and there is 100% coverage in unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n* Initial support for gate instantiations in the parser and AST\r\n* Tightened a bunch of parser rules for things like variable modifiers\r\n* Support parsing strength and delay modifiers in continuous assignments\r\n* Support creating implicit nets in all places allowed by the LRM\r\n* Full support for pragma directives in the preprocessor\r\n* $typename should now return the correct result for all types, as mandated by the LRM\r\n* Support for the type() operator in all places type references are allowed\r\n* Support for slicing packed and unpacked arrays across module array instantiations\r\n* Implement all rules related to variable lifetimes (static vs automatic)\r\n* Correctly prevent assignments to constants, nonblocking assignments to automatic variables\r\n* Support const'() casts\r\n* Support time literals, including all of the scaling and rounding rules\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* Lots of work was done on the documentation, CI builds, and the website.

This slims down the dependency tree and improved performance.\r\n* A bunch of improvements were made to the AST->JSON serialization (thanks @Kuree )\r\n* Printing of types in diagnostics was improved\r\n* Added a general system for correcting typos. For example:\r\n```SystemVerilog\r\nmodule m;\r\n    int someInt;\r\n    int foo = someIn;\r\nendmodule\r\n```\r\n```\r\nsource:3:15: error: use of undeclared identifier 'someIn'; did you mean 'someInt'?\r\n    int foo = someIn;\r\n              ^~~~~~\r\nsource:2:9: note: declared here\r\n    int someInt;\r\n        ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Lots of fixes to error recovery and error reporting in various cases\r\n* Struct members that required looking up type names was previously broken and has now been fixed\r\n* Fixed the check applied to enum initializers with unknown bits for 2-state base types\r\n* Port connections were previously not being type checked; that has been fixed\r\n* Fixed the result type of unary bitwise-not expressions"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/22989961","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/22989961/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/22989961/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/tag/v0.2","id":22989961,"author":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIyOTg5OTYx","tag_name":"v0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.2: More elaboration features and bugfixes","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-01-20T22:55:30Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:57Z","published_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:57Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/assets/17468194","id":17468194,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE3NDY4MTk0","name":"slang-linux.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":94344670,"digest":null,"download_count":26,"created_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/download/v0.2/slang-linux.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/assets/17468195","id":17468195,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE3NDY4MTk1","name":"slang-windows.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"MikePopoloski","id":702179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjE3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/702179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski","html_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikePopoloski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":58710915,"digest":null,"download_count":31,"created_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T23:24:45Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/releases/download/v0.2/slang-windows.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/tarball/v0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MikePopoloski/slang/zipball/v0.2","body":"This release fills in a bunch of missing holes and corner cases and cleans up a bunch of bugs.
