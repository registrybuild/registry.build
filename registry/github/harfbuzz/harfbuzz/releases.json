What's Changed\r\n- The change in version 10.3.0 to apply “trak” table tracking values to glyph advances directly has been reverted as it required every font functions implementation to handle it, which breaks existing custom font functions. Tracking is instead back to being applied during shaping.\r\n- When `directwrite` integration is enabled, we now link to `dwrite.dll` instead of dynamically loading it.\r\n- A new experimental APIs for getting raw “CFF” and “CFF2” CharStrings.\r\n- We now provide manpages for the various command line utilities. Building manpages requires “help2man” and will be skipped if it is not present.\r\n- The command line utilities now set different return value for different kinds of failures. Details are provided in the manpages.\r\n- Various fixes and improvements to `fontations` font functions.\r\n- All shaping operations using the `ot` shaper have become memory allocation-free.\r\n- Glyph extents returned by `hb-ot` and `hb-ft` font functions are now rounded in stead of flooring/ceiling them, which also matches what other font libraries do.\r\n- Fix “AAT” deleted glyph marks interfering with fallback mark positioning.\r\n- Glyph outlines emboldening have been moved out of `hb-ot` and `hb-ft` font functions to the HarfBuzz font layer, so that it works with any font functions implementation.\r\n- Fix our fallback C++11 atomics integration, which seems to not be widely used.\r\n- Various testing fixes and improvements.\r\n- Various subsetting fixes and

What's Changed\r\n- There are three new font-functions implementations (integrations) in this release:\r\n  * `hb-coretext` has gained one, calling into the CoreText library,\r\n  * `hb-directwrite` has gained one, calling into the DirectWrite library.\r\n  * `hb-fontations` has gained one, calling into the Skrifa Rust library.\r\n  All three are mostly useful for performance and correctness testing, but some clients might find them useful.\r\n  An API is added to use them from a single API by providing a backend name string:\r\n  * `hb_font_set_funcs_using()`\r\n- Several new APIs are added, to load a font-face using different \"face-loaders\", and a single entry point to them all using a loader name string:\r\n  * `hb_ft_face_create_from_file_or_fail()` and `hb_ft_face_create_from_blob_or_fail()`\r\n  * `hb_coretext_face_create_from_file_or_fail()` and `hb_coretext_face_create_from_blob_or_fail()`\r\n  * `hb_directwrite_face_create_from_file_or_fail()` and `hb_directwrite_face_create_from_blob_or_fail()`\r\n  * `hb_face_create_from_file_or_fail_using()`\r\n- All drawing and painting operations using the default, `hb-ot` functions have become memory allocation-free.\r\n- Several performance optimizations have been implemented.\r\n- Application of the `trak` table during shaping has been improved.\r\n- The `directwrite` shaper now supports font variations, and correctly applies user features.\r\n- The `hb-directwrite` API and shaper has graduated from experimental.\r\n- Various bug fixes and other improvements.\r\n\r\n- New API:\r\n+hb_malloc\r\n+hb_calloc\r\n+hb_realloc\r\n+hb_free\r\n+hb_face_list_loaders\r\n+hb_face_create_or_fail_using\r\n+hb_face_create_from_file_or_fail_using\r\n+hb_font_list_funcs\r\n+hb_font_set_funcs_using\r\n+hb_coretext_face_create_from_blob_or_fail\r\n+hb_directwrite_face_create_from_file_or_fail\r\n+hb_directwrite_face_create_from_blob_or_fail\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_create\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_get_dw_font_face\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_set_funcs\r\n+hb_fontations_font_set_funcs\r\n+hb_ft_face_create_from_blob_or_fail\r\n+hb_paint_push_font_transform\r\n+hb_paint_push_inverse_font_transform\r\n+HB_BUFFER_CLUSTER_LEVEL_GRAPHEMES\r\n+HB_BUFFER_CLUSTER_LEVEL_IS_MONOTONE\r\n+HB_BUFFER_CLUSTER_LEVEL_IS_GRAPHEMES\r\n+HB_BUFFER_CLUSTER_LEVEL_IS_CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n- Deprecated API:\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_get_dw_font\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @parona-source made their first contribution in https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/pull/5090\r\n* @pweiskircher made

What's Changed\r\n- Vastly improved “AAT” shaping performance. LucidaGrande benchmark-shape before: 14.6ms after: 5.9ms.\r\n- Improved OpenType shaping performance (kerning / ligature), at the expense of ~1kb per face allocated cache memory. Roboto-Regular benchmark-shape before: 10.3ms after: 9.4ms.\r\n- Improved “COLRv1” benchmark-font paint performance. Before: 7.85ms after 4.85ms.\r\n- Don’t apply glyph substitutions in “morx” table of a font with known broken “morx” table (AALMAGHRIBI.ttf font).\r\n- Update IANA and OT language registries.\r\n- Various documentation updates.\r\n- Various build improvements, and test speed-ups.\r\n- The “hb_face_reference_blob()” API now works for faces created with “hb_face_create_for_tables()” if the face sets “get_table_tags” callback. This constructs a new face blob from individual table blobs.\r\n- Various fixes to how “trak” table is handled to bring it closer to Core Text behaviour. Particularly, the tracking values for sizes not explicitly set in the table are now properly interpolated, and the tracking is applied to glyph advances when they are returned by ot-font functions, instead of applying them during shaping. The “trak” pseudo OpenType feature that could be used to disable “trak” table application have been dropped.\r\n- Core Text font functions now support non-BMP code points.\r\n- The drawing algorithm used by hb-draw for “glyf” table now match the algorithm used by FreeType and Core Text.\r\n- The “hb_coretext_font_create()” API now copy font variations from Core Text font to the created HarfBuzz font.\r\n- Add an API to get the feature tags enabled on a given shape-plan after executing it, which can be used to applications to show in the UI what features are applied by default (which can vary based on the font, the script, the language, and the direction set on the buffer).\r\n- Add APIs to created HarfBuzz font from DirectWrite font, and copy the font variations.\r\n\r\n- New API:\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_create()\r\n+hb_directwrite_font_get_dw_font()\r\n+hb_ot_shape_plan_get_feature_tags()\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @jimwang118 made their first contribution in

What's Changed\r\n- Fix the sign of fallback vertical glyph advance (used when font has no vertical advance data).\r\n- Increase maximum “CFF” operands limit 20 times to support more complex fonts.\r\n- Add “--face-loader” option to command line utilities.\r\n- Support “COLR” v0 table in hb_font_get_glyph_extents().\r\n- Add support for font functions that use Core Text APIs, similar to FreeType font functions. This allows, for example, using drawing fonts that use the new (and undocumented) “hvgl” table.\r\n- Update IANA and OT language registries, as well ase USE data files.\r\n- Fix build with ICU 76.\r\n- Various compiler warnings and build fixes.\r\n- Various subsetter fixes.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @serval2412 made their first contribution in

What's Changed\r\n- Unicode 16.0.0 support.\r\n- Various documentation fixes.\r\n- Various build fixes.\r\n- Add API to allow HarfBuzz client to set what glyph to use when a Unicode Variation Selector is not supported by the font, which would allow the client  to customize what happens in this case, by using a different font for example.\r\n- Add a callback to for “hb_face_t” for getting the list of table tags. This is now used to make calling “hb_face_get_table_tags()” work on a faces created by “hb_face_create_for_tables()” (e.g. faces returned by “hb_subset_or_fail()”).\r\n- CGJ and Mongolian Variation Selectors are now ignored during glyph positioning, previously they would block both glyph substitution and positioning across them.\r\n- Support cairo script as an output format for “hb-view” command line tool.\r\n- Drop an optimization that would cause HarfBuzz not apply pair positioning lookup subtables under certain circumstances, for compatibility with other implementations that do apply these subtables.\r\n- Subsetting will now fail if source font has no glyphs, so feeding the subsetter invalid data will not silently return an empty face.\r\n- If after partially instancing a font no variation data is left (the instance is fully static), don’t consider this a failure.\r\n- Workaround a Firefox bug in displaying SVGs generated be “hb-view” command line tool under certain circumstances.\r\n- Fix bug in macroman mapping for “cmap” table.\r\n- Fix difference shaping output when HarfBuzz is built with with “HB_NO_OT_RULESETS_FAST_PATH” enabled.\r\n- Various subsetting and instancing fixes.\r\n- Various fuzzing fixes.\r\n- Add “with_libstdcxx” meson build option.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Arshia001 made their first contribution in

What's Changed\r\n- HarfBuzz now the supports the proposed new OpenType “VARC” table. This replaces the previously supported “Variable Composites” experimental feature. “VARC” support is still experimental and it is not enabled unless HarfBuzz is built with experimental APIs enabled:\r\n  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/VARC.md\r\n- Autotools build system have been dropped. Meson is the only supported build system in HarfBuzz going forward.\r\n- Speed up “AAT” shaping for short words by up to 4%.\r\n- Ignore unknown “CFF” operators.\r\n- “hb_subset_input_keep_everything()” now keeps also non-unicode “name” table records.\r\n- Update the IANA and OpenType language tag registries.\r\n- Support composite glyphs with very large number of points in hb-draw API.\r\n- Various build fixes.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @kanavin made their first contribution in https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/pull/4734\r\n* @ssmid made their first

What's Changed\r\n- New, experimental, WebAssembly (WASM) shaper, that provides greater flexibility over OpenType/AAT/Graphite shaping, using WebAssembly embedded inside the font file. Currently WASM shaper is disabled by default and needs\r\n  to be enabled at build time. For details, see:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md\r\n\r\n  For example fonts making use of the WASM shaper, see:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz-wasm-examples\r\n\r\n- Improvements to Experimental features introduced in earlier releases:\r\n  - Support for subsetting [beyond-64k](https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/beyond-64k.md) and [VarComposites](https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-varComposites.md) fonts.\r\n  - Support for instancing variable fonts with [cubic “glyf”](https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-cubicOutlines.md) table.\r\n\r\n- Many big speed optimizations:\r\n  - Up to 89% speedup loading variable fonts for shaping.\r\n  - Up to 88% speedup in small subsets of large (eg.
