(#8752, #8465)\r\n- Fonts: fixed a bug where dynamically changing font loader would lose the Fallback and Ellipsis glyphs under some circumstance. (#8763)\r\n- Fonts: for large size fonts, layout/size calculation only load glyphs metrics. Actual glyphs are renderer+packed when used by drawing functions. (#8758, #8465)\r\n- Fonts: set a maximum font size of 512.0f at ImGui:: API level to reduce edge cases (e.g. out of memory errors). `ImDrawList::` API doesn't have the constraint. (#8758)\r\n- Fonts: restore `ImFontConfig::FontNo` being a 32-bits value as this is needed to pass full range of information into e.g. FreeType's face_index, as higher bits are used from FreeType 2.6.1. (#8775) [@Valakor] (the field has been erroneously reduced from 32-bits to 8-bit in 1.92.0)\r\n- Textures: Fixed support for `#define ImTextureID_Invalid` to non-zero value: `ImTextureData` was incorrectly cleared with zeroes. (#8745) [@rachit7645]\r\n- Demo: Added `\"Text -> Font Size\"` demo section. (#8738) [@Demonese]\r\n- CI: Fixed dllimport/dllexport tests. (#8757) [@AidanSun05]\r\n- CI: Updated to use latest Windows image + VS2022.\r\n- Debug Tools: added `IMGUI_DEBUG_HIGHLIGHT_ALL_ID_CONFLICTS` to detect id conflicts _before_ hovering. This is very slow and should only be used temporarily. (#8651, #7961, #7669)\r\n- Examples: GLFW+OpenGL3, GLFW+WGPU: Emscripten Makefiles uses GLFW port `contrib.glfw3` which offers better HiDPI support. (#8742) [@pthom]\r\n- Backends: GLFW, SDL2 made `ImGui_ImplGLFW_GetContentScaleXXX()` and `ImGui_ImplSDL2_GetContentScaleXXXX()` helpers return 1.0f on Emscripten and Android platforms, matching macOS logic. (#8742, #8733) [@pthom]\r\n- Backends: SDL3: avoid calling `SDL_StartTextInput()` again if already active. (fixes e.g.: an issue on iOS where the keyboard animation will popup every time the user types a key + probably other things) (#8727) [@morrazzzz]\r\n- Backends: OSX: added `ImGuiMouseCursor_Wait` and `ImGuiMouseCursor_Progress` mouse cursor support. (#8739) [@cfillion]\r\n- Backends: Allegro5: fixed texture update broken on some platforms where `ALLEGRO_LOCK_WRITEONLY` needed all texels to be rewritten. (#8770)\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: use `nonCoherentAtomSize` to align upload_size, fixing validation error on some setups. (#8743, #8744) [@tquante]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: fixed texture synchronization issue introduced in 1.92.0, leading to validation layers being grumpy. (#8772) [@Majora320]\r\n\r\n### Changes from 1.92.0 to 1.92.1 specific to the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking)+[Multi-Viewports](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Viewports) branch:\r\n\r\n- Backends: OSX: Fixed multi-viewport handling broken in 1.92.0.

Glyphs are loaded and rasterized dynamically. No need to specify ranges, prebake etc. (\\*)\r\n- Fonts may be added, removed, reconfigured at any time. Easier to e.g. live compare FreeType features. (\\*)\r\n- Many fonts related changes (but more will come: actually tried to keep those to a minimum for 1.92.0).\r\n- Much easier to pack and manipulate custom data in the dynamic atlas.\r\n- Retina screen rendering works by default (with conforming backend) by updating rasterizer density.\r\n- Updated 13 standard backends to support the new `ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` feature.\r\n- Other stuff: Tree can draw hierarchy outlines. Better Child window resizing. InputText fixes. Tables fixes. Keyboard/Gamepad Nav fixes. [Error Handling](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Error-Handling) improvements, Backends improvements/fixes.\r\n- Submitted PR/fixes for various popular extensions such as ImPlot to work fine with this.\r\n\r\n(\\*) with an updated backend.\r\n\r\n**This is generally \"old school\" tech but written conscientiously to be highly portable and efficient, to serve the need of real-time internal tooling and to allow a decent transition with the countless codebases and millions lines of code written using Dear ImGui. We still don't support RTL, bi-directional editing, and text shaping.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf257b8-8433-456d-a2e0-5202713dead2\r\n\r\n(old video but presently I can't be bothered to make a fancier one)\r\n\r\n## Using a Custom Backend?\r\n\r\n🆘 Need help updating your custom rendering backend to support `ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` ? \r\n\r\nYou can read the newly improved [docs/BACKENDS.md](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/BACKENDS.md).\r\n\r\nHere are the main changes done to all backends:\r\n- Allegro5: ee8941e (+35 lines)\r\n- DirectX9: 75efba7 (+48 lines)\r\n- DirectX10: 2d2b1bc (+40 lines)\r\n- DirectX11: 372fd27 (+40 lines)\r\n- DirectX12: eefe5d5 (+87 lines)\r\n- Metal: 26c017d (+55 lines)\r\n- OpenGL Legacy: 0430c55 (+25 lines)\r\n- OpenGL3/WebGL/ES: dbb91a5 (+47 lines)\r\n- SDL_Renderer2: 9fa65cd (+20 lines)\r\n- SDL_Renderer3: e538883 (+19 lines)\r\n- SDL_GPU: 16fe666 (+41 lines)\r\n- Vulkan: abe294b (+33 lines)\r\n- WGPU: 571dae9 (+30 lines)\r\n\r\n## Changes (since [v1.91.9b](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/v1.91.9b))\r\n\r\n📣 THIS VERSION CONTAINS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BREAKING CHANGES SINCE 2015! I TRIED REALLY HARD TO KEEP THEM TO A MINIMUM, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF INTERFERENCE, BUT INEVITABLY SOME USERS OR THIRD-PARTY EXTENSIONS WILL BE AFFECTED.\r\n\r\n📣 IN ORDER TO HELP US IMPROVE THE TRANSITION PROCESS, INCL. DOCUMENTATION AND COMMENTS, PLEASE REPORT **ANY** DOUBT, CONFUSION, QUESTIONS, YOU CAN SKIM https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/8465 AND THEN PLEASE OPEN A NEW ISSUE.\r\n\r\n📣 If you are using custom widgets, internals or third-party extension that are somehow breaking and aren't obvious how to solve, please post in Issues so we can gather data and share solutions that may help others.\r\n\r\n📣 As part of the plan to reduce impact of API breaking changes, several unfinished changes/features/refactors related to font and text systems and scaling will be part of subsequent releases (1.92.1+).\r\n\r\n📣 If you are updating from an old version, and expecting a massive or difficult update, consider first updating to 1.91.9 to reduce the amount of changes.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Fonts: **IMPORTANT**: if your app was solving the OSX/iOS Retina screen specific logical vs display scale problem by setting `io.DisplayFramebufferScale` (e.g. to 2.0f) + setting `io.FontGlobalScale` (e.g. to 1.0f/2.0f) + loading fonts at scaled sizes (e.g. size X * 2.0f):\r\n    - This WILL NOT map correctly to the new system! Because font will rasterize as requested size.\r\n    - With a legacy backend (< 1.92):\r\n      - Instead of setting `io.FontGlobalScale = 1.0f/N`, set `ImFontCfg::RasterizerDensity = N`.\r\n      - This already worked before, but is now pretty much required.\r\n    - With a new backend (1.92+),\r\n      - This should be all automatic.\r\n      - `FramebufferScale` is automatically used to set current font `RasterizerDensity`.\r\n      - `FramebufferScale` is a per-viewport property provided by backend through the `Platform_GetWindowFramebufferScale()` handler in 'docking' branch.\r\n- Fonts: **IMPORTANT** on Font Sizing:\r\n   - Before 1.92, fonts were of a single size. They can now be dynamically sized.\r\n   - `PushFont()` API now has a REQUIRED size parameter.\r\n       `void PushFont(ImFont* font)` --> `void PushFont(ImFont* font, float size)`\r\n       - `PushFont(font, 0.0f)                       // Change font and keep current size`\r\n       - `PushFont(NULL, 20.0f)                      // Keep font and change current size`\r\n       - `PushFont(font, 20.0f)                      // Change font and set size to 20.0f`\r\n       - `PushFont(font, style.FontSizeBase * 2.0f)  // Change font and set size to be twice bigger than current size.`\r\n       - `PushFont(font, font->LegacySize)           // Change font and set size to size passed to AddFontXXX() function. Same as pre-1.92 behavior, for fixed size fonts.`\r\n   - To use old behavior use `ImGui::PushFont(font, font->LegacySize)` at call site. We intentionally didn't add a default parameter because it would make the long-term transition more difficult.\r\n   - Kept inline redirection font. Will obsolete.\r\n   - Global scale factors may be applied over the provided size. This is why it is called `FontSizeBase` in the style structure.\r\n   - Global scale factors are: `style.FontScaleMain`, `style.FontScaleDpi` and maybe more.\r\n   - `ImFont::FontSize` was removed and does not make sense anymore.\r\n   - `ImFont::LegacySize` is the size passed to `AddFont()`.\r\n   - Removed support for old `PushFont(NULL)` which was a shortcut for \"revert to default font\".\r\n   - Renamed/moved `io.FontGlobalScale` to `style.FontScaleMain`.\r\n- Fonts: **IMPORTANT** on Font Merging:\r\n  - When searching for a glyph in multiple merged fonts: font inputs are now scanned in order for the first font input which the desired glyph. This is technically a different behavior than before!\r\n  - e.g. If you are merging fonts you may have glyphs that you expected to load from Font Source 2 which exists in Font Source 1. After the update and when using a new backend, those glyphs may now loaded from Font Source 1!\r\n  - You can use `Metrics/Debugger->Fonts->Font->Input Glyphs Overlap Detection Tool` to see list of glyphs available in multiple font sources. This can facilitate understanding which font input is providing which glyph.\r\n  - You can use `ImFontConfig::GlyphExcludeRanges[]` to specify ranges to ignore in given Input:\r\n```cpp\r\n// Add Font Source 1 but ignore ICON_MIN_FA..ICON_MAX_FA range\r\nstatic ImWchar exclude_ranges[] = { ICON_MIN_FA, ICON_MAX_FA, 0 };\r\nImFontConfig cfg1;\r\ncfg1.GlyphExcludeRanges = exclude_ranges;\r\nio.Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF(\"segoeui.ttf\", 0.0f, &cfg1);\r\n\r\n// Add Font Source 2, which expects to use the range above\r\nImFontConfig cfg2;\r\ncfg2.MergeMode = true;\r\nio.Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF(\"FontAwesome4.ttf\", 0.0f, &cfg2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Textures:\r\n  - All API functions taking a `ImTextureID` parameter are now taking a 'ImTextureRef`:\r\n    - `ImTextureRef` is a small composite structure which may be constructed from a `ImTextureID` (or constructed from a `ImTextureData*` which represent a texture which will generally be ready by the time of rendering).\r\n    - Affected functions are:\r\n      - `ImGui::Image()`, `ImGui::ImageWithBg()`, `ImGui::ImageButton()`,\r\n      - `ImDrawList::AddImage()`, `ImDrawList::AddImageQuad()`, `ImDrawList::AddImageRounded()`.\r\n    - We suggest that C users and any higher-level language bindings generators may facilitate converting this in some way, aka emulating the trivial C++ constructor.\r\n- Fonts: obsoleted `ImFontAtlas::GetTexDataAsRGBA32()`, `GetTexDataAsAlpha8()`, `Build()`, `SetTexID()` and `IsBuilt()` functions. The new protocol for backends to handle textures doesn't need them. Kept redirection functions (will obsolete).\r\n   - A majority of old backends should still work with new code (behaving like they did before).\r\n   - Calling `ImFontAtlas::Build()` before initializing new backends will erroneously trigger preloading all glyphs. Will be detected with an assertion after the backend is initialized.\r\n- Fonts: `ImFontConfig::OversampleH`/`OversampleV` default to automatic (== 0) since v1.91.8. **It is quite important you keep it automatic** until we decide if we want to provide a way to express finer policy, otherwise you will likely waste texture space when using large glyphs. Note that the `imgui_freetype` backend doesn't use and does not need oversampling.\r\n- Fonts: specifying glyph ranges is now unnecessary.\r\n  - The value of `ImFontConfig::GlyphRanges[]` is only useful for legacy backends.\r\n  - All `GetGlyphRangesXXXX()` functions are now marked obsolete:\r\n    - `GetGlyphRangesDefault()`, `GetGlyphRangesGreek()`, `GetGlyphRangesKorean()`, `GetGlyphRangesJapanese()`, `GetGlyphRangesChineseSimplifiedCommon()`, `GetGlyphRangesChineseFull()`, `GetGlyphRangesCyrillic()`, `GetGlyphRangesThai()`, `GetGlyphRangesVietnamese()`.\r\n- Fonts: removed `ImFontAtlas::TexDesiredWidth` to enforce a texture width. (#327) (it vaguely made sense with the old system as if unspecified textures width maxed up to 4096 but that limit isn't necessary anymore, and Renderer_TextureMaxWidth covers this). However you may set `atlas->TexMinWidth == atlas->TexMaxWidth` for the same effect.\r\n- Fonts: if you create and manage `ImFontAtlas` instances yourself (instead of relying on `ImGuiContext` to create one, you'll need to call `ImFontAtlasUpdateNewFrame()` yourself. An assert will trigger if you don't.\r\n- Fonts: obsoleted `ImGui::SetWindowFontScale()` which is not useful anymore. Prefer using `PushFont(NULL, style.FontSizeBase * factor)` or to manipulate other scaling factors.\r\n- Fonts: obsoleted `ImFont::Scale` which is not useful anymore.\r\n- Fonts: changed `ImFont::CalcWordWrapPositionA()` to `ImFont::CalcWordWrapPosition()`:\r\n   - old: `const char* CalcWordWrapPositionA(float scale, const char* text, ....);`\r\n   - new: `const char* CalcWordWrapPosition (float size,  const char* text, ....);`\r\n  The leading `float scale` parameters was changed to `float size`. This was necessary as `scale` is assuming a unique font size. Kept inline redirection function assuming using `font->LegacySize`.\r\n- Fonts: generally reworked Internals of `ImFontAtlas` and `ImFont`. While in theory a vast majority of users shouldn't be affected, some use cases or extensions might be. Among other things:\r\n    - `ImDrawCmd::TextureId` has been changed to `ImDrawCmd::TexRef`.\r\n    - `ImFontAtlas::ConfigData[] has been renamed to `ImFontAtlas::Sources[]`.\r\n    - `ImFont::ConfigData[]`, `ConfigDataCount` has been renamed to `Sources[]`, `SourceCount`.\r\n    - Each `ImFont` has a number of `ImFontBaked` instances corresponding to actively used sizes. `ImFont::GetFontBaked(size)` retrieves the one for a given size.\r\n    - Fields moved from `ImFont` to `ImFontBaked`:\r\n      - `ImFont::IndexAdvanceX[]` -> `ImFontBaked::IndexAdvanceX[]`\r\n      - `ImFont::Glyphs[]` -> `ImFontBaked::Glyphs[]`\r\n      - `ImFont::Ascent`, `Descent` -> `ImFontBaked::Ascent`, `Descent`\r\n      - `ImFont::FindGlyph()` -> `ImFontBaked::FindGlyph()`\r\n      - `ImFont::FindGlyphNoFallback()` -> `ImFontBaked::FindGlyphNoFallback()`\r\n      - `ImFont::GetCharAdvance()` -> `ImFontBaked::GetCharAdvance()`\r\n      - Widget code may use `ImGui::GetFontBaked()` instead of `ImGui::GetFont()` to access font data for current font at current font size.\r\n        (and you may use `font->GetFontBaked(size)` to access it for any other size.)\r\n            `g.Font` == `ImGui::GetFont()`\r\n            `g.FontSize` == `ImGui::GetFontSize()`\r\n            `g.FontBaked` == `ImGui::GetFontBaked()` == `ImGui::GetFont()->GetFontBaked(ImGui::GetFontSize())`\r\n  Please report if you are affected!\r\n- Fonts: (users of imgui_freetype)\r\n  - renamed `ImFontAtlas::FontBuilderFlags` to `ImFontAtlas::FontLoaderFlags`.\r\n  - renamed `ImFontConfig::FontBuilderFlags` to `ImFontConfig::FontLoaderFlags`.\r\n  - renamed `ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags` to `ImGuiFreeTypeLoaderFlags`.\r\n  - if you used runtime `imgui_freetype` selection rather than the default compile-time option provided by `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE`:\r\n     - renamed/reworked `ImFontBuilderIO` into `ImFontLoader`,\r\n     - renamed `ImGuiFreeType::GetBuilderForFreeType()` to `ImGuiFreeType::GetFontLoader()`\r\n       - old: `io.Fonts->FontBuilderIO = ImGuiFreeType::GetBuilderForFreeType();`\r\n       - new: `io.Fonts.FontLoader = ImGuiFreeType::GetFontLoader();`\r\n- DrawList: Renamed `ImDrawList::PushTextureID()`/`PopTextureID()` to `PushTexture()`/`PopTexture()`.\r\n- Fonts: (users of custom rectangles)\r\n  - Renamed `AddCustomRectRegular()` to `AddCustomRect()`. (#8466)\r\n  - Added `GetCustomRect()` as a replacement for `GetCustomRectByIndex()` + `CalcCustomRectUV()`. (#8466)\r\n  - The output type of `GetCustomRect()` is now `ImFontAtlasRect`, which include UV coordinates.\r\n      - `ImFontAtlasCustomRect::X` --> `ImFontAtlasRect::x`\r\n      - `ImFontAtlasCustomRect::Y` --> `ImFontAtlasRect::y`\r\n      - `ImFontAtlasCustomRect::Width` --> `ImFontAtlasRect::w`\r\n      - `ImFontAtlasCustomRect::Height` --> `ImFontAtlasRect::h`\r\n    Before:\r\n```cpp\r\n        const ImFontAtlasCustomRect* r = atlas->GetCustomRectByIndex(custom_rect_id);\r\n        ImVec2 uv0, uv1;\r\n        atlas->GetCustomRectUV(r, &uv0, &uv1);\r\n        ImGui::Image(atlas->TexRef, ImVec2(r->w, r->h), uv0, uv1);\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```cpp\r\n        ImFontAtlasRect r;\r\n        atlas->GetCustomRect(custom_rect_id, &r);\r\n        ImGui::Image(atlas->TexRef, ImVec2(r.w, r.h), r.uv0, r.uv1);\r\n````\r\nWe added a redirecting typedef but haven't attempted to magically redirect the field names, as this API is rarely used and the fix is simple.\r\n  - Obsoleted `AddCustomRectFontGlyph()` as the API does not make sense for scalable fonts:\r\n    - Kept existing function which uses the font \"default size\" (`Sources[0]->LegacySize`).\r\n    - Added a helper `AddCustomRectFontGlyphForSize()` which is immediately marked obsolete, but can facilitate transitioning old code.\r\n    - Prefer adding a font source (`ImFontConfig`) using a custom/procedural loader.\r\n- Backends: removed `ImGui_ImplXXXX_CreateFontsTexture()`/`ImGui_ImplXXXX_DestroyFontsTexture()` for all backends that had them. They should not be necessary any more.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplMetal_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplMetal_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplOpenGL2_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplOpenGL2_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer2_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer2_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer3_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer3_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n   - removed `ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture()`, `ImGui_ImplVulkan_DestroyFontsTexture()`.\r\n- Layout: commented out legacy `ErrorCheckUsingSetCursorPosToExtendParentBoundaries()` fallback obsoleted in 1.89 (August 2022) which allowed a `SetCursorPos()`/`SetCursorScreenPos()` call WITHOUT AN ITEM to extend parent window/cell boundaries. Replaced with assert/tooltip that would already happens if previously using `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS`. (#5548, #4510, #3355, #1760, #1490, #4152, #150)\r\n  - Incorrect way to make a window content size 200x200:\r\n      - `Begin(...) + SetCursorScreenPos(GetCursorScreenPos() + ImVec2(200,200)) + End();`\r\n  - Correct ways to make a window content size 200x200:\r\n      - `Begin(...) + SetCursorScreenPos(GetCursorScreenPos() + ImVec2(200,200)) + Dummy(ImVec2(0,0)) + End();`\r\n      - `Begin(...) + Dummy(ImVec2(200,200)) + End();`\r\n  - TL;DR; if the assert triggers, you can add a `Dummy({0,0})` call to validate extending parent boundaries.\r\n- TreeNode: renamed `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NavLeftJumpsBackHere` to `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NavLeftJumpsToParent` for clarity. Kept inline redirection enum (will obsolete). (#1079, #8639)\r\n- Commented out `PushAllowKeyboardFocus()`/`PopAllowKeyboardFocus()` which was obsoleted in 1.89.4 (March 2023). (#3092)\r\n   - `PushAllowKeyboardFocus(bool tab_stop)` --> `PushItemFlag(ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop, !tab_stop);`\r\n   - `PopAllowKeyboardFocus()` --> `PopItemFlag();`\r\n- Commented out `ImGuiListClipper::ForceDisplayRangeByIndices()` which was obsoleted in 1.89.6 (June 2023).\r\n   - `ForceDisplayRangeByIndices()` --> `IncludeItemsByIndex()`\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Fixed casing typo in function name: (#8509, #8163, #7998, #7988) [@puugz]\r\n   - `Imgui_ImplSDLGPU3_PrepareDrawData()` --> `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_PrepareDrawData()`\r\n- Internals: `RenderTextEllipsis()` function removed the 'float clip_max_x' parameter directly preceding 'float ellipsis_max_x'. Values were identical for a vast majority of users. (#8387)\r\n\r\n### Non-breaking Fonts/Textures related changes:\r\n\r\n- Textures: added partial texture update protocol. (#8465, #3761)\r\n  - The Renderer Backend needs to set `io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` and handle texture updates requests.\r\n  - New structs: `ImTextureData`, `ImTextureRect`.\r\n  - New enums: `ImTextureStatus`, `ImTextureFormat`.\r\n  - During its `ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderDrawData()` call, the backend can now access a texture list in `ImDrawData::Textures[]`. Textures may have four distinct states:\r\n    - `ImTextureStatus_WantCreate`: requesting backend to create a texture.\r\n    - `ImTextureStatus_WantUpdates`: requesting backend to copy given blocks from the CPU side copy of the texture to your graphics pipeline. A `tex->Updates[]` list of update is provided as well as a single `tex->UpdatesRect` bounding box.\r\n    - `ImTextureStatus_WantDestroy`: requesting backend to destroy the texture.\r\n       - A `int UnusedFrames` value is provided to conveniently defer destroying.\r\n       - Backend is generally free to destroy textures whenever they like.\r\n    - `ImTextureStatus_OK`: nothing to do.\r\n  - Almost all standard backends have been updated to support this.\r\n  - Backends have allowed to destroy textures at any time if they desire so. A list is available in `platform_io.Textures[]` for this purpose and for backend shutdown.\r\n  - Both `stb_truetype` and `FreeType` backends have been updated to work with the new system, and they now share more code than before.\r\n  - Added `#define IMGUI_HAS_TEXTURES` to facilitate compile-time checks for third-party extensions until this is merged with a definitive version number to check.\r\n- Fonts: font backend/loader may easily be changed dynamically, allowing users to compare rasterizers outputs and features. `imgui_freetype` is generally beneficial.\r\n- Fonts: `ImFontAtlas::AddFontXXX()` functions may be called at any time during the frame.\r\n- Fonts: `ImFontAtlas::AddFontXXX()` can fail more gracefully if error handling is configured to not assert (this will be better exposed via future font flags).\r\n- Fonts: added `style.FontScaleBase` scaling factor (previously called `io.FontGlobalScale`).\r\n- Fonts: added `style.FontScaleDpi` scaling factor. This is designed to be be changed on per-monitor/per-viewport basis, which `io.ConfigDpiScaleFonts` does automatically (which is why it is separate from `style.FontScaleBase`).\r\n- Fonts: added font_size parameter to `ImGui::PushFont()` function.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontAtlas::RemoveFont()` function.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontAtlas::CompactCache()` function.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontAtlas::TexDesiredFormat` field (default to `ImTextureFormat_RGBA32`, may be changed to `ImTextureFormat_Alpha8`).\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontAtlas::TexMinWidth`, `TexMinHeight`, `TexMaxWidth`, `TexMaxHeight` fields.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontConfig::PixelSnapV` to align scaled `GlyphOffset.y` to pixel boundaries.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontConfig::GlyphExcludeRanges[]`, which behave similarly to `ImFontConfig::GlyphRanges[]`, but has the opposite meaning. It is tailored to situations where merged fonts have overlapping characters.\r\n- Fonts: added `\"Input Glyphs Overlap Detection Tool\"` which dumps a list of glyphs provided by merged sources, which may help setting up a `GlyphExcludeRanges[]` filter.\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontAtlas::FontBackendName` (which is surfaced in the \"About Dear ImGui\" window and other locations).\r\n- Fonts: added `ImFontFlags` (currently needs to be passed through `ImFontConfig` until we revamp font loading API):\r\n   - `ImFontFlags_NoLoadError`: disable erroring/assert when calling `AddFontXXX()` with missing file/data. Calling code is expected to check `AddFontXXX()` return value.\r\n   - `ImFontFlags_NoLoadGlyphs`: disable loading new glyphs.\r\n   - `ImFontFlags_LockBakedSizes`: disable loading new baked sizes, disable garbage collecting current ones. e.g. if you want to lock a font to a single size.\r\n- Fonts: the general design has changed toward meaning that a `ImFont` doesn't have have a specific size: it may be bound and drawn with any size.\r\n   - We store `ImFontBaked` structures internally, which are a cache of information for a given size being drawn. You should not need to deal with ImFontBaked directly.\r\n   - `ImFontBaked` structures may be cleaned up between frames when unused, pointers to them are only valid for the current frame.\r\n   - Added `ImFontBaked::IsGlyphLoaded()` function.\r\n- Fonts: Custom Rect packing has generally been reworked. (#8107, #7962, #1282)\r\n  - `ImFontAtlas::AddCustomRect()` (previously `AddCustomRectRegular()`/`AddCustomRectFontGlyph()`) functions will immediately return a packed rectangle identifier, and you can write your pixels immediately - previously had to wait for Build() to be called. This is also the case when using a legacy backend.\r\n  - Custom packed rectangles may be moved during a texture change, aka practically anytime. Always refer to latest uvs/position returned by `GetCustomRect()`!\r\n  - `AddCustomRect()` returns `ImFontAtlasRectId_Invalid` on failure.\r\n  - Added `ImFontAtlas::RemoveCustomRect()` function.\r\n  - `GetCustomRect()` can safely return false and not crash when passed an invalid or removed id.\r\n- Fonts: texture is now stored in a single format CPU side (save ~25% when using RGBA).\r\n- Fonts: changing current font to one from a different atlas is supported. (#8080)\r\n- Fonts: automatic baking of an \"...\" ellipsis works better with monospace fonts.\r\n- Fonts: each `ImFontConfig` font source may provide a custom backend/loader.\r\n- Fonts: added `platform_io.Renderer_TextureMaxWidth`/`Renderer_TextureMaxHeight` fields for Renderer Backend to specify if there is a maximum accepted texture size (not yet used).\r\n- Fonts: added compile-time overridable `#define ImTextureID_Invalid 0` if you need 0 to be a valid low-level texture identifier.\r\n- Fonts: reworked text ellipsis logic to ensure a \"...\" is always displayed instead of a single character. (#7024)\r\n- Fonts: word-wrapping code handle ideographic comma & full stop (U+3001, U+3002). (#8540)\r\n- Fonts: fixed `CalcWordWrapPosition()` fallback when width is too small to wrap: would use a +1 offset instead of advancing to the next UTF-8 codepoint. (#8540)\r\n- Debug Tools: Fonts section: add font preview, add `\"Remove\"` button, add `\"Load all glyphs\"` button, add selection to change font backend when both are compiled in.\r\n- Renderer Backends:\r\n  - Backends: DX9/DX10/DX11/DX12, Vulkan, OpenGL2/3, Metal, SDLGPU3, SDLRenderer2/3, WebGPU, Allegro5:\r\n    - Added `ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` support for all backends. (#8465, #3761, #3471) [@ocornut, @ShironekoBen, @thedmd]\r\n    - Added `ImGui_ImplXXXX_UpdateTexture(ImTextureData* tex)` functions for all backends. Available if you want to start uploading textures right after ImGui::Render() and without waiting for the call to `ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderDrawData()`. Also useful if you use a staged or\r\n      multi-threaded rendering schemes, where you might want to set `ImDrawData::Textures = NULL`. (#8597, #1860)\r\n- Special thanks for fonts/texture related feedback to: @thedmd, @ShironekoBen, @rodrigorc, @pathogendavid, @itamago, @rokups, @DucaRii, @Aarkham, @cyfewlp & more.\r\n\r\n### Other changes:\r\n\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f1f0ba-96b8-4c7b-96ba-3aa8fcdeb82a)\r\n\r\n- IO: variations in analog-only components of gamepad events do not interfere with trickling of mouse position events (#4921, #8508)\r\n- Windows: fixed `SetNextWindowCollapsed()`/`SetWindowCollapsed()` bypassing the codepath that preserves last contents size when collapsed, resulting in programmatically uncollapsing auto-sizing windows having them flicker size for a frame. (#7691) [@achabense]\r\n- Windows: clicking on a window close button doesn't claim focus and bring to front. (#8683)\r\n- Windows: loosened code to allow hovering of resize grips, borders, and table borders while hovering a sibling child window, so that the code in master matches one in docking (they accidentally diverged). (#8554)\r\n- Windows: `BeginChild()`: fixed being unable to combine manual resize on one axis and automatic resize on the other axis. (#8690) e.g. neither `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeX | ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeY` or `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeY | ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeX` worked before.\r\n- TreeNode: added experimental flags to draw tree hierarchy outlines linking parent and tree nodes: (#2920)\r\n  - `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DrawLinesNone`: No lines drawn (default value in `style.TreeLinesFlags`).\r\n  - `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DrawLinesFull`: Horizontal lines to child nodes. Vertical line drawn down to `TreePop()` position: cover full contents.\r\n  - `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DrawLinesToNodes`: Horizontal lines to child nodes. Vertical line drawn down to bottom-most child node.\r\n  - Added `style.TreeLinesFlags` which stores the default setting, which may be overridden in individual TreeNode() calls.\r\n  - Added `style.TreeLinesSize` (default to 1.0f).\r\n  - Added `style.TreeLinesRadius` (default to 0.0f).\r\n  - Added `ImGuiCol_TreeLines` (in default styles this is the same as `ImGuiCol_Border`).\r\n  - Caveats:\r\n    - Tree nodes may be used in many creative ways (manually positioning openable nodes in unusual ways, using indent to create tree-looking structures, etc.) and the feature may not accurately represent them in every cases.\r\n    - The feature adds a little cost as extra data needs to be stored. (`ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DrawLinesToNodes` is slower than `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DrawLinesFull` which may be meaningful on very large trees, as it needs to record bottom-most Y position even for clipped nodes).\r\n    - The feature is unlikely to ever work properly when using a coarse clipper such as `ImGuiListClipper`.\r\n- TreeNode: fixed incorrect clipping of arrow/bullet when using `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanAllColumns`.\r\n- InputText: fixed cursor positioning issue using up/down keys near end of lines while editing non-ASCII text. (Regression from 1.91.2) (#8635, #7925)\r\n- InputText: fixed a buffer overrun that could happen when using dynamically resizing buffers (e.g. `imgui_stdlib.cpp` for `std::string`, or `ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackRezize`) and programmatically making an insertion. (#8689) [@ocornut, @m9710797]\r\n- Tables: fixed `TableHeader()` eager vertical clipping of text which may be noticeable with `FramePadding.y` was too small. (#6236)\r\n- Tables: fixed an assert when combining Tables, Frozen Rows, Clipper and `BeginMultiSelect()` in a certain order. (#8595, #8250)\r\n- Tabs: fixes small issues with how \"...\" ellipsis moved depending on visibility of Close Button or Unsaved Document marker. (#8387)\r\n- Tooltips: tooltips have a maximum size corresponding to host display/monitor size, which mitigates edge case issues in multi-viewport scenarios where abnormally large windows (e.g. determined programmatically) can lead to renderer backend trying to create abnormally large framebuffers.\r\n- TextLinkOpenURL(): added bool return value on click. (#8645, #8451, #7660)\r\n- Scroll: fixed contents size, scrollbar visibility and scrolling resetting issues with abnormally large contents ranges. (#3609, #8215)\r\n- Clipper: some mitigation/improvements for abnormally large contents ranges. (#3609, #8215)\r\n- Nav: fixed assertion when holding gamepad FaceLeft/West button to open CTRL+Tab windowing + pressing a keyboard key. (#8525)\r\n- Nav: fixed scroll fallback (when there are no interactive widgets to jump to) not being enabled on windows with menu or title bar.\r\n- Nav: fixed an issue handling PageUp/PageDown on windows with abnormally large contents range which could lead to clipper requesting very large ranges.\r\n- Error Handling: added better error report and recovery for extraneous `EndPopup()` call. (#1651, #8499)\r\n- Error Handling: added better error report and recovery when calling `EndFrame()` or `Render()` without `NewFrame()`. Was previously only an assert.\r\n- Style, InputText: added `ImGuiCol_InputTextCursor` to configure color of the InputText cursor/caret. (#7031)\r\n- Platform IME: added `ImGuiPlatformImeData::ViewportId` info (backported from Docking branch).\r\n- Platform IME: added `ImGuiPlatformImeData::WantTextInput` which might set independently of `WantVisible`. This is set in the same structure because activating text input generally requires providing a window to the backend. (#8584, #6341)\r\n- DrawList: Fixed a regression from 1.91.1 where a `Begin()`/`PushFont()`/`AddImage()` sequence would not restore the correct atlas Texture Identifier when the `PushFont()` call used a font from a different atlas. (#8694, caused by #3224, #3875, #6398, #7903)\r\n- Misc: added extra operators to `ImVec4` in `IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS` block. (#8510) [@gan74]\r\n- Misc: removed static linkage from operators to facilitate using in C++ modules. (#8682, #8358) [@johmani]\r\n- Demo: changed default framed item width to use `Min(GetFontSize() * 12, GetContentRegionAvail().x * 0.40f)`.\r\n- Renderer Backends:\r\n  - Backends: SDLGPU3: Fixed creating atlas texture earlier than other backends, preventing to load fonts between the Init and NewFrames calls.\r\n  - Backends: SDLGPU3: Made `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_PrepareDrawData()` reuse GPU Transfer Buffers which were unusually slow to recreate every frame. Much faster now. (#8534) [@ocornut, @TheMode]\r\n  - Backends: SDLGPU3: added support for `ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState`. (#8599)\r\n  - Backends: OpenGL3: made GLES 3.20 contexts not access `GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK` nor `GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART`. (#8664) [@DyXel]\r\n  - Backends: DirectX12: Fixed build on MinGW. (#8702, #4594) [@playday3008]\r\n  - Backends: DirectX10, DirectX11, DirectX12: Honor `FramebufferScale` to allow for custom platform backends and experiments using it (consistently with other renderer backends, even though in normal condition it is not set under Windows). (#8412) [@WSSDude]\r\n  - Backends: Vulkan: Deep-copy `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo::PipelineRenderingCreateInfo`'s `pColorAttachmentFormats` buffer when set, in order to reduce common user-error of specifying a pointer to data that gets out of scope. (#8282)\r\n  - Backends: Vulkan: Load dynamic rendering functions using `vkGetDeviceProcAddr()` + try both non-KHR and KHR versions. (#8600, #8326, #8365) [@ChrisTom-94]\r\n  - Backends: Vulkan: fixed validation errors in window create/resize helpers used by examples and by multi-viewports implementation, which would typically trigger errors while detaching secondary viewports. (#8600, #8176) [@ChrisTom-94]\r\n- Platform Backends:\r\n  - Backends: GLFW: added `ImGui_ImplGlfw_GetContentScaleForMonitor()`, `ImGui_ImplGlfw_GetContentScaleForWindow()` helpers. They are wrappers to `glfwGetMonitorContentScale()` / `glfwGetWindowContentScale()`, with compile-time GLFW version checks + returning 1.0f on Apple platform.\r\n  - Backends: GLFW: Added support for multiple Dear ImGui contexts. (#8676, #8239, #8069)\r\n  - Backends: SDL2: added `ImGui_ImplSDL2_GetDpiScaleForDisplay()` and `ImGui_ImplSDL2_GetContentScaleForWindow()` helpers. They are wrappers to `SDL_GetDisplayDPI()`, with compile-time SDL version checks + returning 1.0f on Apple platforms. SDL3 already does this by default.\r\n  - Backends: Win32: Fixed an issue where externally losing mouse capture (due to e.g. focus loss) would fail to claim it again the next subsequent click. (#8594)\r\n  - Backends: SDL2, SDL3, OSX: Fill gamepad inputs and set `ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad` regardless of `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad` being set. (#8508)\r\n  - Backends: SDL2, SDL3: don't attempt to call `SDL_CaptureMouse()` on drivers where we don't call `SDL_GetGlobalMouseState()`. This is specifically for Wayland but we currently use the same white-list as `SDL_GetGlobalMouseState()`. (#8561) [@vs49688]\r\n  - Backends: GLFW, SDL2, SDL3: include GLFW/SDL version number in `io.BackendPlatformName`.\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: Update for SDL3 api changes: revert `SDL_GetClipboardText()` memory ownership change. (#8530, #7801) [@Green-Sky]\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: honor `ImGuiPlatformImeData::WantTextInput` as an alternative way to call `SDL_StartTextInput()`, without IME being necessarily visible. (#8584)\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: fixed pulling `SDL_PROP_WINDOW_COCOA_WINDOW_POINTER` into `viewport->PlatformHandleRaw`. (#8725, #8726) [@eertbleyen]\r\n  - Backends: OSX: `ImGui_ImplOSX_HandleEvent()` only process event for window containing our view. (#8644) [@BingoXuan]\r\n- Examples:\r\n  - Examples: Made many examples DPI aware by default. The single-viewport version is basically:\r\n     - Query monitor DPI scale. Helpers are provided in some backends.\r\n     - Call `style.ScaleAllSizes()` and set `style.FontScaleDpi` with this factor.\r\n    Multi-viewport applications may set both of those flags:\r\n     - `io.ConfigDpiScaleFonts = true;`\r\n     - `io.ConfigDpiScaleViewports = true;`\r\n    Which will scale fonts but NOT style padding/spacings/thicknesses yet.\r\n  - Examples: Apple+Metal, Apple+OpenGL: add Makefile (CLion opens them nicely). (#8637) [@pthom]\r\n  - Examples: DirectX12+Win32: also test for `IsIconic()` for sleeping since we don't seem to get a `DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED` signal when minimized. (#8603) [@dooann]\r\n\r\n### Changes from 1.91.9b to 1.92.0 specific to the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking)+[Multi-Viewports](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Viewports) branch:\r\n\r\n- Viewports: added per-viewport `FramebufferScale` for Retina display multi-monitor support. Backend must provide `platform_io.platform_io.Platform_GetWindowFramebufferScale` handler. This effectively fixes clipping/rendering on multi-monitors with varying Retina scale. (#1065, #1542, #1676, #1786, #2826, #3757, #5081, #5580, #5592, #6465, #7273, #7779 etc.)\r\n- Viewports: fixed handling of simultaneous move + resize (e.g. toggling maximized) when `ImGuiConfigFlags_DpiEnableScaleViewports` is enabled.\r\n- Backends: Win32: Viewports: fixed an issue when closing a window from the OS close button (with `io.ConfigViewportsNoDecoration=false`) while user code is discarding the 'bool *p_open=false output' from Begin(). Because we allowed the Win32 window to close early, Windows destroyed it and our imgui window became not visible even though user code was still submitting it.\r\n- Backends: Win32: Viewports: handle `WM_DPICHANGED` in backend when `ImGuiConfigFlags_DpiEnableScaleViewports` is enabled.\r\n- Backends: GLFW, SDL2, SDL3, Apple: provide `Platform_GetWindowFramebufferScale` handler. (#1065, #1542, #1676, #1786, #2826, #3757, #5081, #5580, #5592, #6465, #7273, #7779 etc.)\r\n- Backends: SDLGPU3 for SDL3: added multi-viewport support. (#8573) [@Lekoopapaul]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: revert updating monitors and work areas info every frame. Only do it on Windows to detect task-bar resize until we get an adequate event for it. (#8415, #8558)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: macOS: Fixed secondary-viewports not appearing on a different monitor than the main viewport. Because `SDL_SetWindowParent()` seems to restrict it.\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Disable multi-viewports under Wayland (require GLFW 3.4). (#8587)\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed an issue where Win32 specific WndProc hook was not installed for all GLFW version, preventing mouse vs touch detection from working on secondary viewports.\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\n@AlubJ: _\"I'm using ImGui to write a modding tool for classic LEGO games (The Complete Saga, Indiana Jones 1 and Batman 1) called BactaTank Classic.\"_\r\nhttps://github.com/AlubJ/BactaTank-Classic\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5a29803-6f96-4316-bfb3-71f38e9ac9f6)\r\n\r\n@immortalx74: _\"Dear ImGui spotted on the editor of the early access racing title Assetto Corsa EVO\"_\r\nhttps://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-evo/\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81e0fcc6-c1a2-49f8-9247-3b2efa878a0f)\r\n\r\n@basharast: _\"This was long term project I worked on for more than year ([ImMobile](https://github.com/basharast/ImMobile)), \r\nstarted as an idea for legacy hardware to provide compatible (desktop + mobile os)-like environment, combining community projects and examples into one unified UI for standalone experience purpose.\"_ [...] \"The project was mainly focus on touch support to understand how to resolve touch behavior ([Details](https://github.com/basharast/ImMobile/wiki/Story))\")\r\n| ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8666679a-db14-4ef2-a0c9-86753a650325) | ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39670b39-e10d-4c4c-8dbb-1856c779e106) | ![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07423d30-ad5d-46f5-a0a3-5ac96717dc8d) |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2012dba2-87d5-4001-b1d5-c4efe6e88a98) | ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15cf67e3-4075-4e72-96e3-9d1dc3fc25fd) | ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01eb340e-fac8-426e-81a6-b647ddd7b861) |\r\n\r\n([view & read more about ImMobile..](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/8333#issuecomment-2798143401))\r\n\r\n**MCUViewer** - Simplifying Embedded Debugging \r\nhttps://mcuviewer.com/\r\n_\"Rediscover your embedded system\"_\r\n_\"Profile interrupts with minimal overhead\"_\r\n_\"Analyze high speed data on low cost targets\"_\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b361470-de3a-466c-a98b-4751a4e81186\r\n\r\n@native-m: \r\n(continuation from https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/7503#issuecomment-2198662128) progress of my unfinished DAW (VST3 support, piano roll, many more)\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad2dea1-1c79-4c08-96fe-2f7b80fcea14)\r\n\r\n@kingofknights: _\"This is my side HFT project\"_\r\n[Arthur](https://github.com/kingofknights/Arthur)\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca0afe1e-f3f5-4cf8-a272-f250b33cb585)\r\n\r\n@stewmath: _\"I rewrote my Zelda Oracles romhacking toolkit with imgui - I gotta say, compared to the old GUI that was using GTK, it's ridiculous how much easier this is to code with!\"_\r\nRepo: https://github.com/Stewmath/LynnaLab\r\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2MOVATt1VY\r\n\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f390a575-1390-44b3-acc9-f535a066c5f5)\r\n\r\n@tay10r: _\"A web UI for controlling my microscope!\"_\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb2d384-53aa-4386-9eed-9950576a90f7)\r\n\r\n**City of None** from blog post \"Making Video Games in 2025 (without an engine)\" \r\nhttps://noelberry.ca/posts/making_games_in_2025/\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/582b03b5-6071-41d9-9088-d3619e3fb883)\r\n\r\n@brenocq: _ImGui spotted in MrBeast's YouTube video [\"How We Make Our Deadly Traps\"](https://youtu.be/5wF-XZLHynU?si=tpvXCmg1aHUfkAar&t=316) to visualize where bombs were planted.\"_\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f98c22db-99e6-48a5-8257-c0aa9833f6e6)\r\n\r\nFrom https://bsky.app/profile/echolevel.co.uk/post/3lq3a5rvsz22m\r\n_\" A glimpse of my composing & mixing workflow in The Siege and The Sandfox.

(#8131, #8238)\r\n  - Old function signature:\r\n      `void Image      (ImTextureID tex_id, ImVec2 image_size, ImVec2 uv0 = (0,0), ImVec2 uv1 = (1,1), ImVec4 tint_col = (1,1,1,1), ImVec4 border_col = (0,0,0,0));`\r\n  - New function signatures:\r\n      `void Image      (ImTextureID tex_id, ImVec2 image_size, ImVec2 uv0 = (0,0), ImVec2 uv1 = (1,1));`\r\n      `void ImageWithBg(ImTextureID tex_id, ImVec2 image_size, ImVec2 uv0 = (0,0), ImVec2 uv1 = (1,1), ImVec4 bg_col = (0,0,0,0), ImVec4 tint_col = (1,1,1,1));`\r\n  - TL;DR: `border_col` had misleading side-effect on layout, `bg_col` was missing, parameter order couldn't be consistent with `ImageButton()`.\r\n  - New behavior always use `ImGuiCol_Border` color + `style.ImageBorderSize` / `ImGuiStyleVar_ImageBorderSize`.\r\n  - Old behavior altered border size (and therefore layout) based on border color's alpha, which caused variety of problems.\r\n  - Old behavior used a fixed value of 1.0f for border size which was not tweakable.\r\n  - Kept legacy signature (will obsolete), which mimics the old behavior, but uses `Max(1.0f, style.ImageBorderSize)` when `border_col` is specified.\r\n  - Added `ImageWithBg()` function which has both `bg_col` (which was missing and most useful) and `tint_col`. It was impossible to add `bg_col` to Image() with a parameter order consistent with other functions, so we decided to remove `tint_col` and introduce `ImageWithBg()`.\r\n- Renamed `ImFontConfig::GlyphExtraSpacing.x` option to `GlyphExtraAdvanceX`. (#242)\r\n- Renamed `style.TabMinWidthForCloseButton` to `style.TabCloseButtonMinWidthUnselected`.\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added `uint32_t api_version` argument to `ImGui_ImplVulkan_LoadFunctions()`. Note that it was also added to `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo()` but for the later it is optional. (#8326, #8365, #8400)\r\n- Internals: Fonts: ImFontAtlas::ConfigData[] has been renamed to ImFontAtlas::Sources[],\r\n- Internals: Fonts: ImFont::ConfigData[], ConfigDataCount has been renamed to Sources[], SourcesCount.\r\n- Internals: Menus: reworked mangling of menu windows to use `\"###Menu_00\"` etc. instead of `\"##Menu_00\"`, allowing them to also store the menu name before it. This shouldn't affect code unless directly accessing menu window from their mangled name.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed `IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit()` signal being broken for `Checkbox()`, `RadioButton()`, `Selectable()`. Regression from 2025/01/13. (#8370)\r\n- Windows: Fixed an issue where `BeginChild()` inside a collapsed `Begin()` wouldn't inherit the `SkipItems` flag, resulting in missing coarse clipping opportunities for code not checking the `BeginChild()` return value.\r\n- Windows, Style: Added `style.WindowBorderHoverPadding` setting to configure inner/outer padding applied to hit-testing of windows borders and detection of hovered window.\r\n- InputText: Allow CTRL+Shift+Z to redo even outside of OSX. (#8389) [@tanksdude]\r\n- InputText: Pasting a multi-line buffer into a single-line edit replaces carriage return by spaces. (#8459)\r\n- InputTextWithHint(): Fixed buffer-overflow (luckily often with no visible effect) when a user callback modified the buffer contents in a way that altered the visibility of the preview/hint buffer. (#8368) [@m9710797, @ocornut]\r\n- Scrollbar: Rework logic that fades-out scrollbar when it becomes too small, which amusingly made it disappear when using very big font/frame size.\r\n- Scrollbar: Automatically stabilize ScrollbarX visibility when detecting a feedback loop manifesting with ScrollbarX visibility toggling on and off repeatedly. (#8488, #3285, #4539) (feedback loops of this sort can manifest in various situations, but combining horizontal + vertical scrollbar + using a clipper with varying width items is one frequent cause. The better solution is to, either: (1) enforce visibility by using `ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysHorizontalScrollbar` or (2) declare stable contents width with `SetNextWindowContentSize()`, if you can compute it.)\r\n- Tables: fixed calling `SetNextWindowScroll()` on clipped scrolling table to not leak the value into a subsequent window. (#8196)\r\n- Tables: fixed an issue where Columns Visible/Width state wouldn't be correctly restored when hot-reloading .ini state. (#7934)\r\n- Tables: tamed some .ini settings optimizations to more accurately allow overwriting/hot-reloading settings in more situations. (#7934)\r\n- Tables, Error Handling: Recovery from invalid index in `TableSetColumnIndex()`. (#1651)\r\n- Image: Added `ImageWithBg()` variant with bg color and tint color. (#8131, #8238)\r\n- Image, Style: Added `style.ImageBorderSize`, `ImGuiStyleVar_ImageBorderSize`. (#8131, #8238)\r\n- Selectable: Fixed horizontal label alignment with `SelectableTextAlign.x > 0.0f` and specifying a selectable size. (#8338)\r\n- Tabs, Style: made the Close Button of selected tabs always visible by default, without requiring to hover the tab. (#8387)\r\n  - Added `style.TabCloseButtonMinWidthSelected`/`TabCloseButtonMinWidthUnselected` settings to configure visibility of the Close Button for selected and unselected tabs. (-1: always visible. 0.0f: visible when hovered. >0.0f: visible when hovered if minimum width)\r\n  - Default for selected tabs: `TabCloseButtonMinWidthSelected == -1.0f` (always visible)\r\n  - Default for unselected tabs: `TabCloseButtonMinWidthUnselected == 0.0f` (visible when hovered)\r\n- Tabs: fixed middle-mouse-button to close tab not checking that close button is hovered, merely its visibility. (#8399, #8387) [@nicovanbentum]\r\n- TextLink(), TextLinkOpenURL(): fixed honoring text baseline alignment. (#8451, #7660) [@achabense]\r\n- TextLinkOpenURL(): fixed default Win32 `io.PlatformOpenInShellFn` handler to handle UTF-8 regardless of system regional settings. (#7660) [@achabense]\r\n- Disabled: Fixed an issue restoring Alpha in `EndDisabled()` when using nested `BeginDisabled()` calls with `PushStyleVar(ImGuiStyleVar_DisabledAlpha)` within. (#8454, #7640)\r\n- Clipper: Fixed an issue where passing an out of bound index to `clipper.IncludeItemByIndex()` could incorrectly offset the final cursor, even if that index was not iterated through. One case where it would manifest was calling Combo() with an out of range index. (#8450)\r\n- Debug Tools: Added `io.ConfigDebugHighlightIdConflictsShowItemPicker` (defaults to true) to allow disabled Item Picker suggestion in user facing builds. (#7961, #7669)\r\n- Debug Tools: Tweaked layout of ID Stack Tool and always display full path. (#4631)\r\n- Misc: Various zealous warning fixes for newer version of Clang.\r\n- Misc: Added `ImGuiMouseCursor_Wait` and `ImGuiMouseCursor_Progress` mouse cursors (busy/wait/hourglass shape, with or without an arrow cursor).\r\n- Demo: Reorganized \"Widgets\" section to be alphabetically ordered and split in more functions.\r\n- Demo: Combos: demonstrate a very simple way to add a filter to a combo, by showing the filter inside the combo contents. (#718)\r\n- Examples: SDL3: Added comments to clarify setup for users of the unfortunate `SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS` feature. (#8455)\r\n- IO: Added `ImGuiKey_Oem102` to ImGuiKey enum. (#7136, #7201, #7206, #7306, #8468)\r\n- Backends: reworked key handlers to use/prioritize untranslated scancodes instead of translated keycodes when dealing with OEM keys which are too difficult to find a reliable translated mapping on all systems, backends and keyboard layout. (#7136, #7201, #7206, #7306, #7670, #7672, #8468)\r\n  - The affected keys are: `ImGuiKey_Apostrophe`, `ImGuiKey_Comma`, `ImGuiKey_Minus`, `ImGuiKey_Period`, `ImGuiKey_Slash`, `ImGuiKey_Semicolon`, `ImGuiKey_Equal`, `ImGuiKey_LeftBracket`, `ImGuiKey_RightBracket`, `ImGuiKey_Backslash`, `ImGuiKey_GraveAccent`, and newly introduced `ImGuiKey_Oem102`.\r\n  - This is NOT affecting characters used the text inputs.\r\n  - Fixes many cases of keys not emitting a ImGuiKey value with certain keyboard layouts.\r\n  - Makes emitted ImGuiKey values more consistent regardless of keyboard mapping, but you may be getting different values as before.\r\n  - Win32, SDL2, SDL3: Use scancodes for OEM keys.\r\n  - GLFW: `GLFW_KEY_WORLD_1` and `GLFW_KEY_WORLD_2` are emitting `ImGuiKey_Oem102`.\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed clipboard handler assertion when using GLFW <= 3.2.1 compiled with asserts enabled. (#8452)\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Using `SDL_OpenURL()` in `platform_io.Platform_OpenInShellFn` handler. (#7660) [@achabense]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3, Win32, Allegro5: Added support for `ImGuiMouseCursor_Wait` and `ImGuiMouseCursor_Progress` cursors.\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Avoid calling `SDL_GetGlobalMouseState()` when mouse is in relative mode. (#8425, #8407) [@TheMode]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Only start `SDL_CaptureMouse()` when mouse is being dragged, to mitigate issues with e.g. Linux debuggers not claiming capture back on debug break. (#6410, #3650)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Lazily reinitialize embedded GL loader for when calling backend from e.g. other DLL boundaries. (#8406)\r\n- Backends: DirectX12: Fixed an issue where pre-1.91.5 legacy `ImGui_ImplDX12_Init()` signature started breaking in 1.91.8 due to missing command queue. (#8429)\r\n- Backends: Metal: Fixed a crash on application resources. (#8367, #7419) [@anszom]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added `ApiVersion` field in `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo`. Default to header version if unspecified. (#8326, #8365) [@mklefrancois]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Dynamic rendering path loads `\"vkCmdBeginRendering\"`/`\"vkCmdEndRendering\"` (without -KHR suffix) on API 1.3. (#8326, #8365) [@mklefrancois]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Recreate image bind groups during render to allow reuse of `WGPUTextureView` pointers. (#8426, #8046, #7765, #8027) [@pplux, @Jairard]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Fix for DAWN API change `WGPUProgrammableStageDescriptor` -> `WGPUComputeState`. [@PhantomCloak] (#8369)\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Fix for webgpu-native API changes. (#8426) [@pplux]\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.91.8 to 1.91.9 specific to the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking)+[Multi-Viewports](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Viewports) branch:\r\n\r\n- Docking: Removed legacy assert preventing to call `DockBuilderSplitNode()` on an existing split node. This makes using (technically internal) DockBuilder a little more flexible and bearable! (#8472) [@MegaMech]\r\n- Viewports: fixed an issue where in certain cases, a window repositioning leading to a monitor change could have the window incorrectly get clamped within the boundaries of its previous monitor. Would happen e.g. when loading .ini data during runtime. (#8484) \r\n- Viewports: fixed an assert when a window load settings with a position outside monitor bounds, when there are multiple monitors. (#8393, #8385) [@gaborodriguez]\r\n- Viewports + Backends: Win32: Fixed setting title bar text when applicationis compiled without UNICODE. (#7979, #5725) [@lailoken]\r\n- Backends: GLFW, SDL2/SDL3: Update monitors and work areas information every frame, as the later may change regardless of monitor/display changes. (#8415)\r\n- Backends: Win32: `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`'s `SPI_SETWORKAREA` message also triggers a refresh of monitor list, as they contain work area information.

(#8335, #1578, #346)\r\n   - Removed `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaPreview` (made value 0): it is now the default behavior.\r\n   - Prior to 1.91.8: alpha was made opaque in the preview by default _unless_ using `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaPreview`.\r\n   - We now display the preview as transparent by default. You can use `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaOpaque` to use old behavior.\r\n   - The new flags may be combined better and allow finer controls:\r\n     - `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaOpaque`: disable alpha in the preview, but alpha value still editable.\r\n     - `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaNoBg`: disable rendering a checkerboard background behind transparent color.\r\n     - `ImGuiColorEditFlags_AlphaPreviewHalf`: display half opaque / half transparent preview.\r\n- Backends: SDLGPU3: Renamed `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_InitInfo::GpuDevice` to `Device` for consistency. (#8163, #7998, #7988)\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- imgui_freetype: fixed issue where glyph advances would incorrectly be snapped to pixels. Effectively it would only be noticeable when hinting is disabled with `ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags_NoHinting`, as hinting itself snaps glyph advances.\r\n- Inputs: added `IsMouseReleasedWithDelay()` helper. (#8337, #8320). Use if you absolutely need to distinguish single-click from double-clicks by introducing a delay. This is a very rarely used UI idiom, but some apps use this: e.g. MS Explorer single-click on an icon triggers a rename. Generally use with `delay >= io.MouseDoubleClickTime` + combine with a `GetMouseClickedCount() == 1` check.\r\n- Windows: legacy `SetWindowFontScale()` is properly inherited by nested child windows. Note that an upcoming major release should make this obsolete, but in the meanwhile it works better now. (#2701, #8138, #1018)\r\n- Windows, Style: Fixed small rendering issues with menu bar, resize grip and scrollbar when using thick border sizes. (#8267, #7887)\r\n- Windows: Fixed `IsItemXXXX()` functions not working on append-version of `EndChild()`. (#8350) Also made some of the fields accessible after `BeginChild()` to match `Begin()` logic.\r\n- Error Handling: Recovery from missing `EndMenuBar()` call. (#1651)\r\n- Tables, Menus: Fixed using `BeginTable()` in menu layer (any menu bar). (#8355) It previously overrode the current layer back to main layer, which caused an issue with MainMenuBar attempted to release focus when leaving the menu layer.\r\n- Tables, Menus: Fixed tables or child windows submitted inside `BeginMainMenuBar()` being unable to save their settings, as the main menu bar uses `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoSavedSettings`. (#8356)\r\n- ColorEdit, ColorPicker: Fixed alpha preview broken in 1.91.7. (#8336, #8241). [@PathogenDavid]\r\n- Tabs, Style: reworked selected overline rendering to better accommodate for rounded tabs. Reduced default thickness (`style.TabBarOverlineSize`), increased default rounding (`style.TabRounding`). (#8334) [@Kian738, @ocornut]\r\n- Debug Tools: Tweaked font preview.\r\n- ImDrawList: texture baked storage for thick line reduced from ~64x64 to ~32x32. (#3245)\r\n- Fonts: `IndexLookup[]` table hold 16-bit values even in ImWchar32 mode, as it accounts for number of glyphs in same font. This is favorable to `CalcTextSize()` calls touching less memory.\r\n- Fonts: `OversampleH`/`OversampleV` defaults to 0 for automatic selection.\r\n   - `OversampleH == 0` --> use 1 or 2 depending on font size and use of PixelSnapH.\r\n   - `OversampleV == 0` --> always use 1.\r\n- ImFontAtlas: made calling `ClearFonts()` call `ClearInputData()`, as calling one without the other is never correct. (#8174, #6556, #6336, #4723)\r\n- Examples: DirectX12: Reduced number of frame in flight from 3 to 2 in provided example, to reduce latency.\r\n- Examples: Vulkan: better handle `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR` being returned by `vkAcquireNextImageKHR()` or `vkQueuePresentKHR()`. (#7825, #7831) [@NostraMagister]\r\n- Backends: SDL2: removed assert preventing using `ImGui_ImplSDL2_SetGamepadMode()` with `ImGui_ImplSDL2_GamepadMode_Manual` and an empty array. (#8329)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: removed assert preventing using `ImGui_ImplSDL3_SetGamepadMode()` with `ImGui_ImplSDL3_GamepadMode_Manual` and an empty array. (#8329)\r\n- Backends: SDLGPU3: Exposed `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_CreateDeviceObjects()`/`_DestroyDeviceObjects()`.\r\n  Removed return value from `ImGui_ImplSDLGPU3_CreateFontsTexture()`. (#8163, #7998, #7988)\r\n- Backends: SDL_Renderer2/3: Use endian-dependent RGBA32 texture format, to match `SDL_Color`. (#8327) [@dkosmari]\r\n- Backends: DirectX12: Texture upload use the command queue provided in `ImGui_ImplDX12_InitInfo` instead of creating its own.\r\n- Backends: OSX: Removed notification observer when shutting down.

Kept redirection enum (will obsolete). (#6937)\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed issues with `IsItemDeactivated()` and `IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit()` not emitting a reliable signal when an item is deactivated externally: e.g. via an explicit clear of focus, clear of active id, opening of modal etc. (#5184, #5904, #6766, #8303, #8004)\r\n  - It used to work when the interruption happened in the frame before the active item as submitted, but not after. It should work in both cases now.\r\n  - While this is not specific to a certain widgets, typically it would mostly be noticeable on `InputText()` because it keeps `ActiveId` for a longer time while allowing other interaction to happen.\r\n- Error Handling: Fixed bugs recovering from within a table that created a child window, and from nested child windows. (#1651)\r\n- Error Handling: Turned common `EndTable()` and other `TableXXX` functions fail cases into a recoverable error. (#1651, #8314)\r\n- Error Handling: Exposed basic error handling options in `Demo->Tools->Debug Options`. (#1651)\r\n- InputText: Fixed a bug where character replacements performed from a callback were not applied when pasting from clipboard. (#8229)\r\n- InputText: Fixed issue when activating a ReadOnly field when the underlying value is being modified. (#8242)\r\n- InputText: Added sanity check to detect some cases of passing a non zero-terminated input buffer.\r\n- InputText: Fixed not calling CallbackEdit on revert/clear with Escape key, although `IsItemEdited()` was behaving correctly. (#8273)\r\n- Tables: Fixed `TableAngledHeadersRow()` creating an infinite horizontal scrolling region when the table is hosted in a viewport with negative coordinates (left of primary monitor, with multi-viewports enabled).\r\n- Tables, MultiSelect: Fixed an issue where column width may be miss-measured when calling `BeginMultiSelect()` while inside a table. (#8250)\r\n- TreeNode, Tables: Added `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_LabelSpanAllColumns` to make the label (not only the highlight/frame) also spans all columns. This is useful for table rows where you know nothing else is submitted. (#8318, #3565) (Obviously best used with `ImGuiTableFlags_NoBordersInBodyUntilResize`).\r\n- Drags: Added `ImGuiSliderFlags_NoSpeedTweaks` flag to disable keyboard modifiers altering the tweak speed. Useful if you want to alter tweak speed yourself based on your own logic. (#8223)\r\n- Nav: Fixed an issue where Alt key would clear current active item on windows with the `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs` flag. (#8231)\r\n- Debug Tools: Debug Log: hovering `0xXXXXXXXX` values in log is allowed even if a popup is blocking mouse access to the debug log window. (#5855)\r\n- Debug Tools: Item Picker: Always available in Tools menu regardless of value of `io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent`. (#2673)\r\n- Fonts: Fixed miscalculation of Ellipsis (\"...\") character width when automatically created from a single comma character, affecting some fonts/settings (not all).\r\n- Demo: Added label edition to Property Editor demo + fix an ID issue. (#8266) [@moritz-h]\r\n- Misc: Fixed misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.h/.cpp not supporting `#define IMGUI_DISABLE`. (#8294) [@juur]\r\n- Misc: Fixed MinGW builds not using UTF-8 friendly `_wfopen()`. (#8300)\r\n- **Backends: SDL_GPU for SDL3: Added backend for SDL_GPU! (#8163, #7998, #7988)** [@DeltaW0x].\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Added `ImGui_ImplSDL3_InitForSDLGPU()` for consistency, even though it is currently not doing anything particular. (#8163, #7998, #7988)\r\n- Backends: Allegro5: Avoid calling `al_set_mouse_cursor()` repeatedly since it appears to leak on on X11 (#8256). [@Helodity]\r\n- Backends: Metal: Fixed leaks when using metal-cpp. (#8276, #8166) [@selimsandal]\r\n- Backends: Metal: Fixed resource leak when using multiple contexts. (#7419) [@anszom]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Fixed setting `VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR::preTransform` for platforms not supporting `VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR`. (#8222) [@Zer0xFF]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added a few more `ImGui_ImplVulkanH_XXX` helper functions primarily for the purpose of making our examples simpler.\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added `IMGUI_IMPL_VULKAN_MINIMUM_IMAGE_SAMPLER_POOL_SIZE` to clarify how many image sampler descriptors are expected to be available in the provided descriptor pool. Current backend needs 1 but it is expected that by end of Q1 2025 this number will grow (will stay a small number). (#6642)\r\n- Backends: DX11: Expose vertex constant buffer in `ImGui_ImplDX11_RenderState`.\r\n  Reset projection matrix in `ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState` handlers. (#6969, #5834, #7468, #3590)\r\n- Backends: DX10: Expose `ImGui_ImplDX10_RenderState` for completeness. (#6969, #5834, #7468, #3590)\r\n- Examples: Added Win32+Vulkan example for completeness.

It is mostly motivated by the fact that the **Win32 backend in docking branch of v1.91.5 had a crash** when running multiple program instances. Most of the work done this month is part of a larger feature I will talk about later :)\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Backends: DX12: Changed `ImGui_ImplDX12_Init()` signature to take a `ImGui_ImplDX12_InitInfo` struct.\r\n  - Using the new API, application is now required to pass function pointers to allocate/free SRV Descriptors.\r\n  - We provide convenience legacy fields to pass a single descriptor, matching the old API, but upcoming features will want multiple.\r\n  - Legacy ImGui_ImplDX12_Init() signature is still supported (will obsolete).\r\n- Misc: changed CRC32 table from CRC32-adler to CRC32c polynomial in order to be compatible with the result of SSE 4.2 instructions. (#8169, #4933) [@Teselka]\r\n  - As a result, some .ini data may be partially lost when storing checksums (docking and tables information particularly).\r\n  - Because some users have crafted and storing .ini data as a way to workaround limitations of the docking API, we are providing a `#define IMGUI_USE_LEGACY_CRC32_ADLER` compile-time option to keep using old CRC32 tables if you cannot afford invalidating old .ini data.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- InputText: added `ImGuiInputTextFlags_ElideLeft` to elide left side and ensure right side of contents is visible when whole text is not fitting (useful for paths/filenames). (#1442, #1440, #4391, #7208, #8216) [@kucoman, @ocornut]\r\n- InputText: reactivating last activated `InputText()` doesn't restore horizontal scrolling (which was disabled during deactivation anyway).\r\n- Error Handling: fixed cases where recoverable error handling would crash when processing errors outside of the `NewFrame()`..`EndFrame()` scope. (#1651)\r\n- Tables: fixed `SetNextWindowScroll()` value being ignored by `BeginTable()` during the first frame or when scrolling flags have changed. (#8196)\r\n- Misc: changed embedded ProggyClean encoding to save a bit of binary space (~12kb to 9.5kb).\r\n- Misc: added `IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_FONT` to strip embedded font from binary. (#8161) [@demonese]\r\n- Demo: example tree used by Property Editor & Selection demos properly freed on application closure. (#8158) [@Legulysse]\r\n- Fonts: fixed `AddCustomRect()` not being packed with TexGlyphPadding + not accounted for surface area used to determine best-guess texture size. (#8107) [@YarikTH, @ocornut]\r\n- Misc: use SSE 4.2 crc32 instructions when available. (#8169, #4933) [@Teselka]\r\n- Tools: binary_to_compressed_c: added `-u8`/`-u32`/`-base85` export options.\r\n- Backends: DirectX12: Let user specifies the `DepthStencilView` format by setting `ImGui_ImplDX12_InitInfo::DSVFormat`. (#8217) [@bmarques1995]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Make user-provided descriptor pool optional. As a convenience, when setting `init_info->DescriptorPoolSize` then the backend will create and manage one itself. (#8172, #4867) [@zeux]\r\n- Examples: Win32+DX12: Using a basic free-list allocator to manage multiple SRV descriptors.\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.5 to 1.91.6 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Backends: Win32: Fixed a crash/regression in 1.91.5 when running two processes with multi-viewports (was using GetProp() to query property which could have belonged to another process). (#8162, #8069) [@sammyfreg, @ocornut]\r\n- Docking: Added an assert to clarify that `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_CentralNode` flag (from internals) does not need to be passed to DockSpace(), as it causes general havoc.

Read API BREAKING CHANGES section of imgui.cpp.\r\n  - If you have trouble updating a very old codebase using legacy backend-specific key codes:\r\n    consider updating to 1.91.4 first, then #define IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO, then update to latest.\r\n  - Obsoleted `ImGuiKey_COUNT` (it was unusually error-prone/misleading since valid keys don't start at 0). Probably use `ImGuiKey_NamedKey_BEGIN`/`ImGuiKey_NamedKey_END` instead?\r\n- Fonts: removed const qualifiers from most font functions in prevision for upcoming fonts improvements.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Selectable: selected `Selectable` use `ImGuiCol_Header` instead of an arbitrary lerp between `_Header` and `_HeaderHovered` which was introduced v1.91 (#8106, #1861)\r\n- Buttons: using `ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat` makes default button behavior use `_PressedOnClick` instead of `_PressedOnClickRelease` when unspecified.\r\n  - This is intended to make the +/- buttons of `InputInt()`/`InputFloat()` react on the initial mouse down event.\r\n  - Note that it may reveal incorrect usage if you were using `InputInt()`/`InputFloat()` without persistent storage by relying solely on e.g. `IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit()`: this was never supported and didn't work consistently (see #8149).\r\n- InputText: fixed a bug (regression in 1.91.2) where modifying text buffer within a callback would sometimes prevents further appending to the buffer.\r\n- Tabs, Style: made `ImGuiCol_TabDimmedSelectedOverline` alpha 0 (not visible) in default styles as the current look is not right (but `ImGuiCol_TabSelectedOverline` stays the same).\r\n- Log/Capture: added experimental `io.ConfigWindowsCopyContentsWithCtrlC` option to automatically copy window contents into clipboard using CTRL+C. This is experimental because (1) it currently breaks on nested Begin/End, (2) text output quality varies, and (3) text output comes in submission order rather than spatial order.\r\n- Log/Capture: better decorating of `BeginMenu()` and `TabItem()` output.\r\n- Log/Capture: a non terminated log ends automatically in the window which called it.\r\n- imgui_freetype: Fixed a crash in build font atlas when using merged fonts and the first font in a merged set has no loaded glyph. (#8081)\r\n- Backends: DX12: Unmap() call specify written range. The range is informational and may be used by debug tools.\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Replace `SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize()` forward declaration with the actual include. (#8095, #7967, #3190) [@sev-]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL` event doesn't require dividing by 100.0f on Emscripten target. (#4019, #6096, #1463)\r\n- Examples: SDL3+Vulkan: Added example. (#8084, #8085)\r\n- Examples: Android+OpenGL: Using `ALooper_pollOnce()` instead of `ALooper_pollAll()` which has been deprecated. (#8013) [@feather179]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.4 to 1.91.5 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Backends: GLFW: added Linux workaround for spurious mouse up events emitted while dragging and creating new viewports. Generally they would be interrupting a dragging operations. (#3158, #7733, #7922) [@rokups, @ocornut]\r\n- Docking: fixed using `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_KeepAliveOnly` with `DockSpaceOverViewport()`: the normally invisible space did erroneously claim mouse hover and could be potentially focused. (#8125) [@kcbanner]\r\n- :bangbang: **\\*EDIT\\* The imgui_impl_win32 backend in this release has a crashing bug when using multi-viewports + running multiple processes simultaneously (because I didn't realize Win32's SetProp()/GetProp() data were not process bound). Fixed by dad1047 head but not in a tagged release yet.

BeamNG! OTOY! Lucid Games! Asobo! Planestate Software! Aras! Gravity Well! SCS Software! & many individuals ❤️\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to  @GamingMinds-DanielC, @PathogenDavid & more for for their help with patches and answers!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Changes (since [v1.91.3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/v1.91.3))\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Style: renamed `ImGuiCol_NavHighlight` to `ImGuiCol_NavCursor`, for consistency with newly exposed and reworked features. Kept inline redirection enum (will obsolete).\r\n- The typedef for `ImTextureID` now defaults to `ImU64` instead of `void*`. (#1641)\r\n  - This removes the requirement to redefine it for backends which are e.g. storing descriptor sets or other 64-bits structures when building on 32-bits archs (namely our DX12 and Vulkan backends). It therefore simplify various building scripts/helpers.\r\n  - You may have compile-time warnings if you were casting to `void*` instead of `ImTextureID` when passing your types to functions taking `ImTextureID` values, e.g. `ImGui::Image()`. In doubt it is almost always better to do an intermediate `intptr_t` cast, since it allows casting any pointer/integer type without warning:\r\n    - May warn:     `ImGui::Image((void*)MyTextureData, ...);`\r\n    - May warn:     `ImGui::Image((void*)(intptr_t)MyTextureData, ...);`\r\n    - Won't warn:   `ImGui::Image((ImTextureID)(intptr_t)MyTextureData), ...);`\r\n  - Note that you can always #define ImTextureID to be your own high-level structures (with dedicated constructors and extra render parameters) if you like.\r\n- IO: moved `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos` to standalone `io.ConfigNavMoveSetMousePos` bool.\r\n- IO: moved `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavNoCaptureKeyboard` to standalone `io.ConfigNavCaptureKeyboard` bool (note the inverted value!). (#2517, #2009). Kept legacy names (will obsolete) + code that copies settings once the first time. Dynamically changing the old value won't work. Switch to using the new value!\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- IO: added `void* platform_io.Renderer_RenderState` which is set during the `ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderDrawData()` of standard backends to expose selected render states to your draw callbacks. (#6969, #5834, #7468, #3590)\r\n- IO: `io.WantCaptureKeyboard` is never set when `ImGuiConfigFlags_NoKeyboard` is enabled. (#4921)\r\n- Error Handling: turned a few more functions into recoverable errors. (#1651)\r\n- Nav (Keyboard/Gamepad navigation):\r\n  - Nav: added `io.ConfigNavCursorVisibleAuto` and `io.ConfigNavCursorVisibleAlways` to configure visibility of navigation cursor. (#1074, #2048, #7237, #8059, #3200, #787)\r\n     - Set `io.ConfigNavCursorVisibleAuto = true` (default) to enable automatic toggling of cursor visibility (mouse click hide the cursor, arrow keys makes it visible).\r\n     - Set `io.ConfigNavCursorVisibleAlways` to keep cursor always visible.\r\n  - Nav: added `NavSetCursorVisible(bool visible)` function to manipulate visibility of navigation cursor (e.g. set default state, or after some actions). (#1074, #2048, #7237, #8059)\r\n  - Nav: added `io.ConfigNavEscapeClearFocusItem` and `io.ConfigNavEscapeClearFocusWindow` to change how pressing Escape affects navigation. (#8059, #2048, #1074, #3200)\r\n    - Set `io.ConfigNavEscapeClearFocusItem = true` (default) to clear focused item and highlight.\r\n    - Set `io.ConfigNavEscapeClearFocusItem = false` for Escape to not have an effect.\r\n    - Set `io.ConfigNavEscapeClearFocusWindow = true` to completely unfocus the Dear ImGui window, is for some reason your app relies on imgui focus to take other decisions.  \r\n  - Nav: pressing Escape to hide the navigation cursor doesn't clear current location, so it may be restored when Ctrl+Tabbing back into the same window later.\r\n  - Nav: fixed Ctrl+Tab initiated with no focused window from skipping the top-most window. (#3200)\r\n  - Nav: navigation cursor is not rendered for items with `ImGuiItemFlags_NoNav`. Can be relevant when e.g activating a _NoNav item with mouse, then Ctrl+Tabbing back and forth. \r\n- Disabled: clicking a disabled item focuses parent window. (#8064) \r\n- InvisibleButton, Nav: fixed an issue when `InvisibleButton()` would be navigable into but not display navigation highlight. Properly navigation on it by default. (#8057)\r\n- InvisibleButton: added `ImGuiButtonFlags_EnableNav` to enable navigation over the invisible button. (#8057)\r\n- Tooltips: fixed incorrect tooltip positioning when using keyboard/gamepad navigation (1.91.3 regression). (#8036)\r\n- DrawList: `AddCallback()` added an optional size parameter allowing to copy and store any amount of user data for usage by callbacks: (#6969, #4770, #7665)\r\n  - If `userdata_size == 0:` we copy/store the `userdata` argument as-is (existing behavior). It will be available unmodified in `ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackData` during render.\r\n  - If `userdata_size > 0`, we copy/store `userdata_size` bytes pointed to by `userdata` (new behavior). We store them in a buffer stored inside the drawlist. `ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackData` will point inside that buffer so you have to retrieve data from there. Your callback may need to use `ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackDataSize` if you expect dynamically-sized data.\r\n  - Note that we use a raw type-less copy.\r\n- Tables: fixed initial auto-sizing issue with synced-instances. (#8045, #7218)\r\n- InputText: fixed an issue with not declaring ownership of Delete/Backspace/Arrow keys, preventing use of external shortcuts that are not guarded by an ActiveId check. (#8048) [@geertbleyen]\r\n- InputText: ensure mouse cursor shape is set regardless of whether keyboard mode is enabled or not. (#6417)\r\n- InputScalar: added an assert to clarify that `ImGuiInputTextFlags_EnterReturnsTrue` is not\r\n  supported by `InputFloat()`/`InputInt()`/`InputScalar()` etc. widgets. It actually never was. (#8065, #3946)\r\n- imgui_freetype: Added support for plutosvg (as an alternative to lunasvg) to render OpenType SVG fonts. Requires defining `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE_PLUTOSVG` along with `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE`. Providing headers/librairies for plutosvg + plutovg is up to you (see #7927 for help). (#7927, #7187, #6591, #6607) [@pthom]\r\n- Backends: DX11, DX12, SDLRenderer2/3. Vulkan, WGPU: expose selected state in `ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderState` structures during render loop, for user draw callbacks. (#6969, #5834, #7468, #3590)\r\n- Backends: DX9, DX10, DX11, DX12, OpenGL, Vulkan, WGPU: Changed default texture sampler to Clamp instead of Repeat/Wrap. (#7468, #7511, #5999, #5502, #7230)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.3 to 1.91.4 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Backends: changed all backends to allow enabling `ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable` after initialization.

Zero is still a special value due to legacy reasons, unless using `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampZeroRange`. (#7968, #3361, #76)\r\n- Drags: extended behavior of `ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp` to include `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampZeroRange`. It considers v_min==v_max==0.0f as a valid clamping range (aka edits not allowed). Although unlikely, it you wish to only clamp on text input but want v_min==v_max==0.0f to mean unclamped drags, you can use `_ClampOnInput` instead of `_AlwaysClamp`. (#7968, #3361, #76)\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Error Handling: Enabled/improved error recovery systems. (#1651, #5654)\r\n  - Read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Error-Handling for a bit more details.\r\n  - Error recovery is provided as a way to facilitate:\r\n    - Recovery after a programming error. Native code or scripting language (the later tends to facilitate iterating on code while running).\r\n    - Recovery after running an exception handler or any error processing which may skip code after an error has been detected.\r\n  - Error recovery is not perfect nor guaranteed! It is a feature to ease development.\r\n    You not are not supposed to rely on it in the course of a normal application run.\r\n  - Functions that support error recovery are using `IM_ASSERT_USER_ERROR()` instead of `IM_ASSERT()`.\r\n  - By design, we do not allow error recovery to be 100% silent. One of the options needs to be enabled!\r\n  - Possible usage: facilitate recovery from errors triggered from a scripting language or after specific exceptions handlers. Surface errors to programmers in less aggressive ways.\r\n  - Always ensure that on programmers seats you have at minimum Asserts or Tooltips enabled when making direct imgui API calls! Otherwise it would severely hinder your ability to catch and correct mistakes!\r\n  - Added `io.ConfigErrorRecovery` to enable error recovery support.\r\n  - Added `io.ConfigErrorRecoveryEnableAssert` to assert on recoverable errors.\r\n  - Added `io.ConfigErrorRecoveryEnableDebugLog` to output to debug log on recoverable errors.\r\n  - Added `io.ConfigErrorRecoveryEnableTooltip` to enable displaying an error tooltip on recoverable errors. The tooltip include a way to enable asserts if they were disabled.\r\n  - All options are enabled by default.\r\n- Windows: BeginChild(): made it possible to call `SetNextWindowSize()` on a child window using `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeX`, `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeY` in order to override its current size. (#1710, #8020)\r\n- Scrollbar: Shift+Click scroll to clicked location (pre-1.90.8 default). (#8002, #7328)\r\n- Scrollbar: added `io.ConfigScrollbarScrollByPage` setting (default to true). Set `io.ConfigScrollbarScrollByPage=false` to enforce always scrolling to clicked location.  (#8002, #7328)\r\n- Drags: split `ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp` into two distinct flags: (#7968, #3361, #76)\r\n  - `ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp` = `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampOnInput` + `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampZeroRange`.\r\n  - Previously `_AlwaysClamp` only did the equivalent of `_ClampOnInput`.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampOnInput` which is now a subset of `_AlwaysClamp` (note that it was the old name of `_AlwaysClamp`, but we are reintroducing that name).\r\n  - Added `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampZeroRange` to enforce clamping even when v_min==v_max==0.0f in drag functions. Sliders are not affected.\r\n- Tooltips, Drag and Drop: Fixed an issue where the fallback drag and drop payload tooltip appeared during drag and drop release.\r\n- Tooltips, Drag and Drop: Stabilized name of drag and drop tooltip window so thattransitioning from an item tooltip to a drag tooltip doesn't leak window auto-sizing info from one to the other. (#8036)\r\n- Tooltips: Tooltips triggered from touch inputs are positioned above the item. (#8036)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for API changes: `SDL_bool` removal. `SDL_INIT_TIMER` removal.\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Fixed DAWN api change using `WGPUStringView` in `WGPUShaderSourceWGSL`. (#8009, #8010) [@blitz-research]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.2 to 1.91.3 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Fixed building for UWP platforms. (#8008)\r\n- Backends: Win32: Use `ResisterClassW()`/`CreateWindowExW()` for secondary viewports, to ensure correct IME input even if the backend was compiled in MBCS mode.

(#7961, #7669)\r\n  THIS DETECTS THE MOST COMMON USER ERROR BY FIRST-TIME DEAR IMGUI PROGRAMMERS! See [Debug Tools](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Debug-Tools) page.\r\n  - The tool detects when multiple items are sharing the same identifier, due to not using `PushID`/`PopID` in loops, or not using ID stack facilities such as `\"##\"` suffixes. Very frequently it happens when using empty `\"\"` labels.\r\n  - When hovering an item with a conflicting ID, all visible items with the same ID will  be highlighted and an explanatory tooltip is made visible.\r\n  - The feature may be disabled and is exposed in Demo->Tools menu.\r\n  - I've been wanting to add this tool for a long time, but was stalled by finding a way to\r\n    not make it spammy + make it practically zero cost. After @pthom made various proposals to\r\n    solve the same problem (thanks for pushing me!), I decided it was time to finish it.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_AllowDuplicateId` to use with `PushItemFlag()`/`PopItemFlag()` if for some\r\n    reason you intend to have duplicate identifiers.\r\n  - (#74, #96, #480, #501, #647, #654, #719, #843, #894, #1057, #1173, #1390, #1414, #1556, #1768, #2041, #2116, #2330, #2475, #2562, #2667, #2807, #2885, #3102, #3375, #3526, #3964, #4008, #4070, #4158, #4172, #4199, #4375, #4395, #4471, #4548, #4612, #4631, #4657, #4796, #5210, #5303, #5360, #5393, #5533, #5692, #5707, #5729, #5773, #5787, #5884, #6046, #6093, #6186, #6223, #6364, #6387, #6567, #6692, #6724, #6939, #6984, #7246, #7270, #7375, #7421, #7434, #7472, #7581, #7724, #7926, #7937 and probably more..)\r\n- Nav: pressing any keyboard key while holding Alt disable toggling nav layer on Alt release. (#4439)\r\n- MultiSelect+Tables: fixed an issue where box-select would skip items while drag-scrolling in a table with outer borders. (#7970, #7821).\r\n- Inputs: `SetNextItemShortcut()` with `ImGuiInputFlags_Tooltip` doesn't show tooltip when item is active.\r\n- InputText: internal refactoring to simplify and optimize the code. The ImWchar buffer has been removed. Simplifications allowed to implement new optimizations for handling very large text buffers (e.g. in our testing, handling of a 1 MB text buffer is now 3 times faster in VS2022 Debug build). This is the first step toward more refactoring. (#7925) [@alektron, @ocornut]\r\n- InputText: added CJK double-width punctuation to list of separators considered for CTRL+Arrow.\r\n- Tables: fixed auto-width columns when using synced-instances of same table. The previous fix done in v1.90.5 was incomplete. (#7218)\r\n- Tables: fixed assertion related to inconsistent outer clipping when sizes are not rounded. (#7957) [@eclbtownsend]\r\n- Tables: fixed assertion with tables with borders when clipped by parent. (#6765, #3752, #7428)\r\n- Windows: fixed an issue where double-click to collapse could be triggered even while another item is active, if the item didn't use the left mouse button. (#7841)\r\n- Misc: Made it accepted to call `SetMouseCursor()` with any out-of-bound value, as a way to allow hacking in custom cursors if desirable.\r\n- Fonts: fixed ellipsis `\"...\"` rendering width miscalculation bug introduced in 1.91.0. (#7976) [@DDeimos]\r\n- TextLinkOpenURL(): modified tooltip to display a verb \"Open 'xxxx'\". (#7885, #7660)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: use `SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize()` when available. (#7967, #3190) [@scribam]\r\n- Backends: GLFW+Emscripten: use OSX behaviors automatically when using contrib glfw port. (#7965, #7915) [@ypujante]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Added support for optional `IMGUI_IMPL_WEBGPU_BACKEND_DAWN` / `IMGUI_IMPL_WEBGPU_BACKEND_WGPU`\r\n  defines to handle ever-changing native implementations. (#7977, #7969, #6602, #6188, #7523) [@acgaudette]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.1 to 1.91.2 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Viewports: fixed an issue where a window manually constrained to the main viewport while crossing over main viewport bounds isn't translated properly. (#7985)\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3, Win32: ensure that `ImGuiPlatformMonitor` list is available after backend Init call. (#7995)\r\n- Backends: Win32: fixed direct calls to `platform_io.Platform_SetWindowPos()`/`Platform_SetWindowSize()` on windows created by application (typically main viewport).\r\n- Backends: Win32: fixed an issue where a viewport destroyed while clicking would hog mouse tracking and temporary lead to incorrect update of HoveredWindow. (#7971)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: added support for `viewport->ParentViewportId` field to support parenting windows at OS level.

Thank you for allowing Dear ImGui to stay on its path.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to  @GamingMinds-DanielC, @PathogenDavid, @cfillion & more for for their help with patches and answers!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Changes (since [v1.91.0](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/v1.91.0))\r\n\r\nWe are moving a few platform related handlers from the `ImGuiIO` to the `ImGuiPlatformIO` structure.\r\n- If you are using standard backends you'll have nothing to do. \r\n- If you are using a custom and or third-party backend: we kept a legacy redirection but consider updating (you can check by enabling `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS`. Most likely the only functions you used that have moved are `GetClipboardTextFn`/`SetClipboardTextFn()`.\r\n- The `ImGuiPlatformIO` structure already existed in the docking branch to support multi-viewports, we are slowly introducing selected parts of it in the master branch in order to (in the future) add features related to e.g. querying monitor/desktop DPI scale.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- BeginChild(): renamed `ImGuiChildFlags_Border` to `ImGuiChildFlags_Borders` for consistency. [@cfillion]\r\n  Kept inline redirection flag (will obsolete).\r\n- IO: moved clipboard functions from `ImGuiIO` to `ImGuiPlatformIO`:\r\n    - `io.GetClipboardTextFn` -> `platform_io.Platform_GetClipboardTextFn`\r\n    - `io.SetClipboardTextFn` -> `platform_io.Platform_SetClipboardTextFn`\r\n    - in function signatures, changed `void* user_data` to `ImGuiContext* ctx` for consistency with other functions. Pull your user data from `platform_io.ClipboardUserData` if used.\r\n    - as this is will affect all users of custom engines/backends, we are providing proper legacy redirection (will obsolete).\r\n- IO: moved other functions from `ImGuiIO` to `ImGuiPlatformIO`:\r\n    - `io.PlatformOpenInShellFn` -> `platform_io.Platform_OpenInShellFn` (#7660)\r\n    - `io.PlatformSetImeDataFn` -> `platform_io.Platform_SetImeDataFn`\r\n    - `io.PlatformLocaleDecimalPoint` -> `platform_io.Platform_LocaleDecimalPoint` (#7389, #6719, #2278)\r\n    - access those via GetPlatformIO() instead of GetIO().\r\n  (Because `PlatformOpenInShellFn` and `PlatformSetImeDataFn` were introduced extremely recently and\r\n  often automatically set by core library and backends, we are exceptionally not maintaining a legacy redirection symbol for those two.)\r\n- Commented the old `ImageButton()` signature obsoleted in 1.89 (~August 2022). (#5533, #4471, #2464, #1390)\r\n   - old `ImageButton()` used `ImTextureId` as item id (created issue with e.g. multiple buttons in same scope, transient texture id values, opaque computation of ID)\r\n   - new `ImageButton()` requires an explicit `const char* str_id`\r\n   - old `ImageButton()` had a `frame_padding` override argument.\r\n   - new `ImageButton()` always use `style.FramePadding`, which you can modify using `PushStyleVar()`/`PopStyleVar()`.\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- IO: Added `GetPlatformIO()` and `ImGuiPlatformIO`, pulled from 'docking' branch, which is a centralized spot to connect os/platform/renderer related functions. Clipboard, IME and OpenInShell hooks are moved here. (#7660)\r\n- IO, InputText: fixed an issue where typing text in an `InputText()` would defer character processing by one frame, because of the trickling input queue. Reworked interleaved keys<>char trickling to take account for keys known to input characters. (#7889, #4921, #4858)\r\n- Windows: adjust default `ClipRect` to better match rendering of thick borders (which are in theory not supported). Compensate for the fact that borders are centered around the windows edge rather than inner. (#7887, #7888 + #3312, #7540, #3756, #6170, #6365)\r\n- Made `BeginItemTooltip()` and `IsItemHovered()` with delay flag infer an implicit ID (for ID-less items such as Text element) in a way that works when item resizes. (#7945, #1485)\r\n- MultiSelect+TreeNode+Drag and Drop: fixed an issue where carrying a drag and drop payload over an already open tree node using multi-select would incorrectly select it. (#7850)\r\n- MultiSelect+TreeNode: default open behavior is `_OpenOnDoubleClick` + `_OpenOnArrow`\r\n  when used in a multi-select context without any `ImGuiTreeNode_OpenOnXXX` flags set. (#7850)\r\n- Tables: fixes/revert a 1.90 change were outer border would be moved bottom and right by an extra pixel + rework the change so that contents doesn't overlap the bottom and right border in a scrolling table. (#6765, #3752, #7428)\r\n- Tables: fixed an issue resizing columns or querying hovered column/row when using multiple synched instances that are layed out at different X positions. (#7933)\r\n- Tabs: avoid queuing a refocus when tab is already focused, which would have the side-effect of e.g. closing popup on a mouse release. (#7914)\r\n- InputText: allow callback to update buffer while in read-only mode. ([imgui_club/#46](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club/pull/46))\r\n- InputText: fixed an issue programmatically refocusing a multi-line input which was just active. (#4761, #7870)\r\n- TextLink(), TextLinkOpenURL(): change mouse cursor to Hand shape when hovered. (#7885, #7660)\r\n- Tooltips, Drag and Drop: made it possible to override `BeginTooltip()` position while inside a drag and drop source or target: a `SetNextWindowPos()` call won't be overridden. (#6973)\r\n- PlotHistogram, PlotLines: register item ID and use button behavior in a more idiomatic manner, fixes preventing e.g. `GetItemID()` and other ID-based helper to work. (#7935, #3072)\r\n- Style: added `PushStyleVarX()`, `PushStyleVarY()` helpers to conveniently modify only one component of a ImVec2 var.\r\n- Fonts: made it possible to use `PushFont()`/`PopFont()` calls across Begin() calls. (#3224, #3875, #6398, #7903)\r\n- Backends:\r\n  - Backends: GLFW: added `ImGui_ImplGlfw_Sleep()` helper function because GLFW does not provide a way to do a portable sleep. (#7844)\r\n  - Backends: GLFW+Emscripten: Use `OpenURL()` from GLFW3 contrib port when available and using the contrib port instead of Emscripten own GLFW3 implementation. (#7647, #7915, #7660) [@ypujante]\r\n  - Backends: SDL2, SDL3: ignore events of other SDL windows. (#7853) [@madebr, @ocornut]\r\n  - Backends: SDL2, SDL3: storing `SDL_WindowID` inside `ImGuiViewport::PlatformHandle` instead of `SDL_Window*`.\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: Update for API changes: `SDL_GetGamepads()` memory ownership logic was reverted back by SDL3 on July 27. (#7918, #7898, #7807) [@cheyao, @MattGuerrette]\r\n  - Backends: GLFW: passing null window to `glfwGetClipboardString()`/`glfwSetClipboardString()` since GLFW own tests are doing that and it seems unnecessary.\r\n  - Backends: SDL2, SDL3, GLFW, OSX, Allegro: update to set function handlers in ImGuiPlatformIO instead of ImGuiIO.\r\n- Examples:\r\n  - Examples: GLFW (all), SDL2 (all), SDL3 (all), Win32+OpenGL3: rework examples main loop to handle minimization without burning CPU or GPU by running unthrottled code. (#7844)\r\n  - Examples: SDL3: Update for API changes: `SDL_Init()` returns 0 on failure.\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.91.0 to 1.91.1 in the [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) branch:**\r\n\r\n- Viewports: added optional `platform_io.Platform_GetWindowWorkAreaInsets()` hook to allow backends to alter the default per-viewport work-area. (#7823)\r\n- Backends: don't report monitors with DpiScale of 0, which seemed to be reported for virtual monitors instead by accessibility drivers. (#7902) [@nicolasnoble, @ocornut]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: using `SDL_HINT_WINDOW_NO_ACTIVATION_WHEN_SHOWN` to support the `ImGuiViewportFlags_NoFocusOnAppearing` flag, instead of using a Win32-specific hack.

(information thread: #7838)\r\n  You should never need those functions! You can do everything in less a confusing manner by only using `GetCursorScreenPos()` and `GetContentRegionAvail()`. Also always consider that if you are using `GetWindowPos()` and `GetCursorPos()` you may also be making things unnecessarily complicated.\r\n  I repeat: You can do everything with `GetCursorScreenPos()` and `GetContentRegionAvail()`!\r\n   - `GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetCursorPos().x` --> `GetContentRegionAvail().x`\r\n   - `GetWindowContentRegionMax().x + GetWindowPos().x` --> `GetCursorScreenPos().x + GetContentRegionAvail().x` // when called from left edge of window\r\n   - `GetContentRegionMax()` --> `GetContentRegionAvail() + GetCursorScreenPos() - GetWindowPos()` // right edge in local coordinates\r\n   - `GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetWindowContentRegionMin().x` --> `GetContentRegionAvail()` // when called from left edge of window\r\n- Item flag changes:\r\n  - Obsoleted `PushButtonRepeat()`/`PopButtonRepeat()` in favor of using new `PushItemFlag()`/`PopItemFlag()` with `ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat`. Kept inline redirecting functions (will obsolete).\r\n  - Obsoleted `PushTabStop()`/`PopTabStop()` in favor of using new `PushItemFlag()`/`PopItemFlag()` with `ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop`. Kept inline redirecting functions (will obsolete).\r\n  - Renamed `ImGuiSelectableFlags_DontClosePopups` to `ImGuiSelectableFlags_NoAutoClosePopups` for consistency. Kept inline redirecting functions (will obsolete). + Internals: changed/inverted `ImGuiItemFlags_SelectableDontClosePopup` (default==false) to\r\n      `ImGuiItemFlags_AutoClosePopups` (default==true), same logic, only inverted behavior. (#1379, #1468, #2200, #4936, #5216, #7302, #7573)\r\n- Commented out obsolete `ImGuiModFlags` (renamed to `ImGuiKeyChord` in 1.89). (#4921, #456)\r\n- Commented out obsolete `ImGuiModFlags_XXX` values (renamed to `ImGuiMod_XXX` in 1.89). (#4921, #456)\r\n    - `ImGuiModFlags_Ctrl` -> `ImGuiMod_Ctrl`, `ImGuiModFlags_Shift` -> `ImGuiMod_Shift` etc.\r\n- Backends: GLFW+Emscripten: Renamed `ImGui_ImplGlfw_InstallEmscriptenCanvasResizeCallback()` to  `ImGui_ImplGlfw_InstallEmscriptenCallbacks()`, with an additional `GLFWWindow*` parameter. (#7647) [@ypujante]\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- Added `TextLink()`, `TextLinkOpenURL()` hyperlink widgets. (#7660)\r\n- IO: added `io.PlatformOpenInShellFn()` handler to open a link/folder/file in OS shell. (#7660)\r\n  Added IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SHELL_FUNCTIONS to disable default Windows/Linux/Mac implementation.\r\n- IO: added `io.ConfigNavSwapGamepadButtons` to swap Activate/Cancel (A<>B) buttons, to match the  typical \"Nintendo/Japanese consoles\" button layout when using Gamepad navigation. (#787, #5723)\r\n- Added `PushItemFlag()`/`PopItemFlags()`, `ImGuiItemFlags` to modify shared item flags:\r\n   - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop` to disable tabbing through items.\r\n   - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_NoNav` to disable any navigation and focus of items. (#787)\r\n   - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_NoNavDefaultFocus` to disable item being default focus. (#787)\r\n   - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat` to enable repeat on any button-like behavior.\r\n   - Added `ImGuiItemFlags_AutoClosePopups` to disable menu items/selection auto closing parent popups.\r\n     Disabling this was previously possible for Selectable() via a direct flag but not for MenuItem(). (#1379, #1468, #2200, #4936, #5216, #7302, #7573)\r\n   - This was mostly all previously in imgui_internal.h.\r\n- Multi-Select: added multi-select API and demos. (#1861, #6518)\r\n   - **This system implements standard multi-selection idioms (CTRL+mouse click, CTRL+keyboard moves, SHIFT+mouse click, SHIFT+keyboard moves, etc.) with support for clipper (not submitting non-visible items), box-selection with scrolling, and many other details.**\r\n   - In the spirit of Dear ImGui design, your code owns both items and actual selection data. This is designed to allow all kinds of selection storage you may use in your application (e.g. set/map/hash, intrusive selection, interval trees, up to you).\r\n   - The supported widgets are Selectable(), Checkbox(). TreeNode() is also technically supported but...  using this correctly is more complicated. You need some sort of linear/random access to your tree, which is suited to advanced trees setups already implementing filters and clipper. We will work toward simplifying our existing demo for trees.\r\n   - A helper `ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage` is provided to facilitate getting started in a typical app (likely to suit a majority of users).\r\n   - Documentation:\r\n     - Wiki page https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Select for API overview.\r\n     - Demo code + headers are well commented.\r\n  - Added `BeginMultiSelect()`, `EndMultiSelect()`, `SetNextItemSelectionUserData()`.\r\n  - Added `IsItemToggledSelection()` for use if you need latest selection update during current iteration.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiMultiSelectIO` and `ImGuiSelectionRequest` structures:\r\n    - `BeginMultiSelect()` and `EndMultiSelect()` return a `ImGuiMultiSelectIO` structure, which is mostly an array of `ImGuiSelectionRequest` actions (clear, select all, set range, etc.)\r\n    - Other fields are helpful when using a clipper, or wanting to handle deletion nicely.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage` helper to store and maintain a selection (optional):\r\n    - This is similar to if you used e.g. a std::set<ID> to store a selection, with all the right  glue to honor `ImGuiMultiSelectIO` requests. Most applications can use that.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiSelectionExternalStorage` helper to maintain an externally stored selection (optional):\r\n    - Helpful to easily bind multi-selection to e.g. an array of checkboxes.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags` options:\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_SingleSelect`: Disable selecting more than one item. This is available to allow single-selection code to share same code/logic if desired. It essentially disables the main purpose of BeginMultiSelect() tho!\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoSelectAll`: Disable CTRL+A shortcut to select all.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoRangeSelect`: Disable Shift+selection mouse/keyboard support (useful for unordered 2D selection). With BoxSelect is also ensure contiguous SetRange requests are not combined into one. This allows not handling interpolation in SetRange requests.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoSelect`: Disable selecting items when navigating (useful for e.g. supporting range-select in a list of checkboxes).\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoClear`: Disable clearing selection when navigating or selecting another one (generally used with ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoSelect. useful for e.g. supporting range-select in a list of checkboxes).\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoClearOnReselect`: Disable clearing selection when clicking/selecting an already selected item. (#7424)\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect1d`: Enable box-selection with same width and same x pos items (e.g. full row Selectable()). Box-selection works better with little bit of spacing between items hit-box in order to be able to aim at empty space.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect2d`: Enable box-selection with varying width or varying x pos items support (e.g. different width labels, or 2D layout/grid). This is slower: alters clipping logic so that e.g. horizontal movements will update selection of normally clipped items.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelectNoScroll`: Disable scrolling when box-selecting near edges of scope.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnEscape`: Clear selection when pressing Escape while scope is focused.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnClickVoid`. Clear selection when clicking on empty location within scope.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ScopeWindow` (default): Scope for _BoxSelect and _ClearOnClickVoid is whole window (Default). Use if BeginMultiSelect() covers a whole window or used a single time in same window.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ScopeRect`: Scope for _BoxSelect and _ClearOnClickVoid is rectangle encompassing BeginMultiSelect()/EndMultiSelect(). Use if BeginMultiSelect() is called multiple times in same window.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_SelectOnClick` (default): Apply selection on mouse down when clicking on unselected item. (Default)\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_SelectOnClickRelease`: Apply selection on mouse release when clicking an unselected item. Allow dragging an unselected item without altering selection.\r\n    - `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NavWrapX`: [Temporary] Enable navigation wrapping on X axis. Provided as a convenience because we don't have a design for the general Nav API for this yet. When the more general feature be public we may obsolete this flag in favor of new one.\r\n  - Demo: Added \"Examples->Assets Browser\" demo.\r\n  - Demo: Added \"Widgets->Selection State & Multi-Select\" section, with:\r\n    - Multi-Select\r\n    - Multi-Select (with clipper)\r\n    - Multi-Select (with deletion)\r\n    - Multi-Select (dual list box) (#6648)\r\n    - Multi-Select (in a table)\r\n    - Multi-Select (checkboxes)\r\n    - Multi-Select (multiple scopes)\r\n    - Multi-Select (tiled assert browser)\r\n    - Multi-Select (trees) (#1861)\r\n    - Multi-Select (advanced)\r\n- Inputs: added `SetItemKeyOwner(ImGuiKey key)` in public API. This is a simplified version of a more complete set of function available in imgui_internal.h. One common use-case for this is to allow your widgets to disable standard inputs behaviors such as Tab or Alt handling, Mouse Wheel scrolling, etc. (#456, #2637, #2620, #2891, #3370, #3724, #4828, #5108, #5242, #5641)\r\n```\r\n     // Hovering or activating the button will disable mouse wheel default behavior to scroll\r\n     InvisibleButton(...);\r\n     SetItemKeyOwner(ImGuiKey_MouseWheelY);\r\n```\r\n- Nav: fixed clicking window decorations (e.g. resize borders) from losing focused item when within a child window using `ImGuiChildFlags_NavFlattened`.\r\n- InputText: added '\\' and '/' as word separator. (#7824, #7704) [@reduf]\r\n- TreeNode: added `SetNextItemStorageID()` to specify/override the identifier used for persisting open/close storage. Useful if needing to often read/write from storage without manipulating the ID stack. (#7553, #6990, #3823, #1131)\r\n- Selectable: added `ImGuiSelectableFlags_Highlight` flag to highlight items independently from the hovered state. (#7820) [@rerilier]\r\n- Clipper: added `SeekCursorForItem()` function. When using `ImGuiListClipper::Begin(INT_MAX)` you can can use the clipper without knowing the amount of items beforehand. In this situation, call `ImGuiListClipper::SeekCursorForItem(items_count)` at the end of your iteration loop to position the layout cursor correctly. This is done automatically if provided a count to Begin(). (#1311) \r\n- Groups, Tables: fixed `EndGroup()` failing to correctly capture current table occupied size. (#7543)\r\n- Style, TabBar: added `style.TabBarOverlineSize` / `ImGuiStyleVar_TabBarOverlineSize` to manipulate thickness of the horizontal line over selected tabs. [@DctrNoob]\r\n- Style: close button and collapse/window-menu button hover highlight made rectangular instead of round.\r\n- Misc: added `GetID(int)` variant for consistency. (#7111)\r\n- Debug Tools:\r\n  - Debug Log: Added `IMGUI_DEBUG_LOG()`, `ImGui::DebugLog()` in public API. (#5855)\r\n    Printed entries include imgui frame counter prefix + are redirected to `ShowDebugLogWindow()` and other configurable locations. Always call IMGUI_DEBUG_LOG() for maximum stripping in caller code.\r\n  - Debug Log: Added \"Configure Outputs..\" button. (#5855)\r\n  - Debug Log: Fixed incorrect checkbox layout when partially clipped.\r\n- Demo: Reworked \"Property Editor\" demo in a manner that more resemble the tree data and\r\n  struct description data that a real application would want to use.\r\n- Backends:\r\n  - Backends: Win32: Fixed `ImGuiMod_Super` being mapped to `VK_APPS` instead of `VK_LWIN || VK_RWIN`. (#7768, #4858, #2622) [@Aemony]\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: Update for API changes: `SDL_GetGamepads()` memory ownership change. (#7807)\r\n  - Backends: SDL3: Update for API changes: `SDL_GetClipboardText()` memory ownership change.

No significant nested type left.\r\n- BeginChild: added `ImGuiChildFlags_NavFlattened` as a replacement for the window flag `ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened`: the feature only ever made sense for BeginChild() calls anyhow. (#7687) [@cfillion]\r\n   - old: `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, 0, ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened);`\r\n   - new: `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, ImGuiChildFlags_NavFlattened, 0)`\r\n  Kept inline redirection flag (will obsolete).\r\n- Style: renamed tab colors for clarity and consistency with other changes: (#261, #351)\r\n  - `ImGuiCol_TabActive`          -> `ImGuiCol_TabSelected`\r\n  - `ImGuiCol_TabUnfocused`       -> `ImGuiCol_TabDimmed`\r\n  - `ImGuiCol_TabUnfocusedActive` -> `ImGuiCol_TabDimmedSelected`\r\n  Kept inline redirecting enums (will obsolete).\r\n- IO: `io.ClearInputKeys()` (first exposed in 1.89.8) doesn't clear mouse data. Newly added `io.ClearInputMouse()` does. (#4921)\r\n- Drag and Drop: renamed `ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceAutoExpirePayload` to `ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadAutoExpire`. Kept inline redirecting enum (will obsolete). (#1725, #143)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- IO: do not disable `io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges` (which allow resizing from borders and lower-left corner) when `ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors` is not set by backend. The initial reasoning is that resizing from borders feels better when correct mouse cursor shape change as honored by backends. Keeping this enabling will hopefully increase pressure on third-party backends to set `ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors` and honor changes of `ImGui::GetMouseCursor()` value. (#1495)\r\n- IO: do not claim `io.WantCaptureMouse=true` on the mouse release frame of a button which was pressed over void/underlying app, which is consistent/needed to allow the mouse up event of a drag over void/underlying app to catch release. (#1392) [@Moka42]\r\n- IO: Added `io.ClearInputMouse()` to clear mouse state. (#4921)\r\n- Windows: BeginChild(): fixed a glitch when during a resize of a child window which is tightly close to the boundaries of its parent (e.g. with zero `WindowPadding`), the child position could have temporarily be moved around by erroneous padding application. (#7706)\r\n- TabBar, Style: added `ImGuiTabBarFlags_DrawSelectedOverline` option to draw an horizontal line over selected tabs to increase visibility. This is used by docking. Added corresponding `ImGuiCol_TabSelectedOverline` and `ImGuiCol_TabDimmedSelectedOverline` colors.\r\n- Tables: added `TableGetHoveredColumn()` to public API, as an alternative to testing for `TableGetColumnFlags(column) & ImGuiTableColumnFlags_IsHovered` on each column. (#3740)\r\n- Disabled, Inputs: fixed using `Shortcut()` or `SetNextItemShortcut()` within a disabled block bypassing the disabled state. (#7726)\r\n- Disabled: Reworked 1.90.8 behavior of `Begin()` not inheriting current `BeginDisabled()` state, to make it that only tooltip windows are temporarily clearing it. (#211, #7640)\r\n- Drags: added `ImGuiSliderFlags_WrapAround` flag for `DragInt()`, `DragFloat()` etc. (#7749)\r\n- Drag and Drop: `BeginDragDropSource()` with `ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceExtern` sets active id so a multi-frame extern source doesn't interfere with hovered widgets. (#143)\r\n- Drag and Drop: `BeginDragDropSource()` with `ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceExtern` does not assume a mouse button being pressed. Facilitate implementing cross-context drag and drop. (#143)\r\n- Drag and Drop: Added `ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadNoCrossContext`/`ImGuiDragDropFlags_PayloadNoCrossProcess` flags as metadata to specify that a payload may not be copied outside the context/process by some logic aiming to copy payloads around.\r\n- Drag and Drop: Fixes an issue when elapsing payload would be based on last payload frame instead of last drag source frame, which makes a difference if not resubmitting payload every frame. (#143)\r\n- Debug Tools: Metrics/Debugger: Browsing a Storage perform hover lookup on identifier.\r\n- Viewports: Backported `void* ImGuiViewport::PlatformHandle` from docking branch for use by backends.\r\n- imgui_freetype: Fixed divide by zero while handling `FT_PIXEL_MODE_BGRA` glyphs. (#7267, #3369)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL2, OpenGL3: `ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_NewFrame()` recreates font texture if it has been destroyed by `ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_DestroyFontsTexture()`. (#7748) [@mlauss2]\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for API removal of keysym field in `SDL_KeyboardEvent`. (#7728)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for `SDL_StartTextInput()`/`SDL_StopTextInput()` API changes. (#7735)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for `SDL_SetTextInputRect()` API rename. (#7760, #7754) [@maxortner01]\r\n- Backends: SDLRenderer3: Update for `SDL_RenderGeometryRaw()` API changes. (SDL#9009).\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Remove `Volk/` from `volk.h` #include directives. (#7722, #6582, #4854) [@martin-ejdestig]\r\n- Examples: SDL3: Remove use of `SDL_HINT_IME_NATIVE_UI` since new `SDL_HINT_IME_IMPLEMENTED_UI` values has a more suitable default for our case case.\r\n- Examples: GLFW+Vulkan, SDL+Vulkan: handle swap chain resize even without Vulkan returning `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR`, which doesn't seem to happen on Wayland. (#7671) [@AndreiNego, @ocornut]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.8 to 1.90.9 related to the Docking branch: (aimed to merge in 1.91)**\r\n\r\n- Windows, Menus: Fixed an issue where the size of sub-menu in their own viewport would be erroneously clamped to the size of main viewport. (#7730)\r\n- Merged `GetBackgroundDrawList()` and `GetBackgroundDrawList(ImGuiViewport* viewport)` api entry points into a same one `GetBackgroundDrawList(ImGuiViewport* viewport = NULL);`\r\n- Merged `GetForegroundDrawList()` and `GetForegroundDrawList(ImGuiViewport* viewport)` api entry points into a same one `GetForegroundDrawList(ImGuiViewport* viewport = NULL);`\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for introduction of SDL_GLContext type from void*. (#7701, #7702) [@bcsanches]\r\n- Backends: Win32: Secondary viewports WndProc handler retrieve/set imgui context from the HWND, allowing WndProc dispatch to work in multi-context setups.\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.8 to 1.90.9 related to the Multi-Select/Range-Select branch: (aimed to merge in 1.91)**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Select\r\n\r\n- MultiSelect: provide RangeDirection to allow selection handler to handler backward shift+click if they wish to make use of that order.\r\n- MultiSelect: Shift+Tab doesn't enable Shift select on landing item.\r\n- MultiSelect: added courtesy `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NavWrapX` flag so we can demo this until a nav api is designed.\r\n- MultiSelect: added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoClearOnReselect`. (#7424)\r\n- MultiSelect: BoxSelect: (breaking) renamed ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect -> ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect2d. Which include not assuming one flag imply the other.\r\n- MultiSelect: BoxSelect: uses `SetActiveIdUsingAllKeyboardKeys()` to avoid nav interference, much like most drag operations.\r\n- MultiSelect: BoxSelect: made Escape disable box-select and clear selection.\r\n- MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: rework to accept massive selections requests without flinching.\r\n- MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: added `GetNextSelectedItem()` to abstract selection storage from user. \r\n- MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: added PreserveOrder, maintain implicit order data in storage.\r\n- Demo: Assets Browser: added a way to disable sorting and hide sorting options.\r\n- Demo: Assets Browser: amend demo to handle drag and drop correctly.\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\n**ImNES = NES Emulator + Rust + ImGui** by @gordnzhou\r\nhttps://github.com/gordnzhou/imnes-emulator\r\n![image](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/6c9bcd50-380e-4673-911c-26ff93d06d83)\r\n\r\n**vīcĭus updater agent**\r\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/vicius\r\n![nefarius_HidHide_Updater_GDFudys8mB](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/79c02cf2-cd0a-460f-8a77-4d3a3e729253)\r\n![Updater_mc9y7o4qcL](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/fb1a010e-5fdd-4f6c-b342-10eea0f772e7)\r\n\r\n**Assassin's Creed Mirage**\r\n![IMG_4538](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/f09ef569-ea23-49ff-a6e2-39ca3766b8d3)\r\n\r\n@native-m _\"continuation from this last post: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/6897#issuecomment-1773959493\"_\r\n_\"An update of my toy DAW...

This should NOT be breaking unless you are using generated headers that have values not matching the main library.\r\n- Removed `ImGuiButtonFlags_MouseButtonDefault_ = ImGuiButtonFlags_MouseButtonLeft` from imgui.h, was mostly unused and misleading.\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- Inputs: Fixed `IsMouseClicked(..., repeat=true);` broken in 1.90.7 on 2024/05/22. (due to an internal api parameter swap, repeat wouldn't be honored and ownership would be accidentally checked even though this api is meant to not\r\n  check ownership). (#7657) [@korenkonder]\r\n- Windows: fixed altering FramePadding mid-frame not correctly affecting logic responsible for honoring `io.ConfigWindowsMoveFromTitleBarOnly`. (#7576, #899)\r\n- Scrollbar: made scrolling logic more standard: clicking above or below the grab scrolls by one page, holding mouse button repeats scrolling. (#7328, #150)\r\n- Scrollbar: fixed miscalculation of vertical scrollbar visibility when required solely by the presence of an horizontal scrollbar. (#1574)\r\n- InputScalar, InputInt, InputFloat: added `ImGuiInputTextFlags_ParseEmptyRefVal` to parse an empty field as zero-value. (#7305) [@supermerill, @ocornut]\r\n- InputScalar, InputInt, InputFloat: added `ImGuiInputTextFlags_DisplayEmptyRefVal` to display a zero-value as empty. (#7305) [@supermerill, @ocornut]\r\n- Popups: fixed an issue preventing to close a popup opened over a modal by clicking over void (it required clicking over the visible part of the modal). (#7654)\r\n- Tables: fixed an issue where ideal size reported to parent container wouldn't correctly take account of inner scrollbar, affecting potential auto-resize of parent container. (#7651)\r\n- Tables: fixed a bug where after disabling the ScrollY flag for a table, previous scrollbar width would be accounted for. (#5920)\r\n- Combo: simplified Combo() API uses a list clipper (due to its api it wasn't previously trivial before we added `clipper.IncludeItemByIndex()` function).\r\n- Disabled: nested tooltips or other non-child window within a `BeginDisabled()` block disable the disabled state. (#211, #7640)\r\n- Misc: made `ImGuiDir` and `ImGuiSortDirection` stronger-typed enums.\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update for `SDL_SYSTEM_CURSOR_xxx` api renames. (#7653)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.7 to 1.90.8 related to the Multi-Select/Range-Select branch: (aimed to merge in 1.91)**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Select\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: when dragging from void, first hit item sets NavId so navigation can resume from that spot.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) Added optional 'items_count' parameter to BeginMultiSelect(). Will enable extra features, and remove equivalent parameter from `ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage::ApplyRequests()`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) renamed `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect` -> `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect1d`, `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect2d` -> `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: renamed `AdapterData` to `UserData`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: added `GetStorageIdFromIndex()` method indirection to be easier on the reader.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage: fixed `Swap()` helper.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added ImGuiSelectionExternalStorage helper. Simplify checkboxes/bool demo.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-select: fixes for checkboxes support.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: mark parent child window as navigable into, with highlight visible when pressing Escape.\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\n@pinojojo: _\"UI for my project on scripting-based 3d printing software.

Thank you for allowing Dear ImGui to stay on its path.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @cfillion, @GamingMinds-DanielC, @PathogenDavid & more for for their help with patches and answers!\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Inputs: on macOS X, Cmd and Ctrl keys are now automatically swapped by `io.AddKeyEvent()`, as this naturally align with how macOS X uses those keys. (#2343, #4084, #5923, #456)\r\n  - Effectively it means that e.g. `ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_C` is a valid idiomatic shortcut for both Windows and Mac style users.\r\n  - It shouldn't really affect your code unless you had explicit/custom shortcut swapping in place for macOS X apps in your input logic.\r\n  - Removed `ImGuiMod_Shortcut` which was previously dynamically remapping to Ctrl or Cmd/Super. It is now unnecessary to specific cross-platform idiomatic shortcuts. Kept symbols redirecting `ImGuiMod_Shortcut` to `ImGuiMod_Ctrl` (will obsolete).\r\n- Commented out obsolete symbols renamed in 1.88 (May 2022):\r\n    - `CaptureKeyboardFromApp()` -> `SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard()`\r\n    - `CaptureMouseFromApp()` -> `SetNextFrameWantCaptureMouse()`\r\n- Backends: `SDL_Renderer2`/`SDL_Renderer3`: `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer2_RenderDrawData()` and `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer3_RenderDrawData()` now takes a `SDL_Renderer*` parameter. This was previously overlooked from the API but it will allow eventual support for multi-viewports.\r\n\r\n**Extra Breaking changes IF AND ONLY IF you were using imgui_internal.h versions of `Shortcut()` or owner-aware versions of `IsKeyPressed()`, `IsKeyChordPressed()`, `IsMouseClicked()` prior to this version.**\r\n<details>\r\n   <summary>(Open for details)</summary>\r\n\r\n- Inputs (Internals): Renamed `ImGuiKeyOwner_None` to `ImGuiKeyOwner_NoOwner`, to make use more explicit and reduce confusion with the fact it is a non-zero value and cannot be a default.\r\n- Inputs (Internals): Renamed symbols global routes:\r\n  - Renamed `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobalLow`  -> `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal` (this is the suggested global route)\r\n  - Renamed `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal` -> `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal | ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverFocused`\r\n  - Renamed `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobalHigh` -> `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal | ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverFocused | ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverActive`\r\n- Inputs (Internals): `Shortcut(), `SetShortcutRouting()`: swapped last two parameters order in function signatures:\r\n    - Before: `Shortcut(ImGuiKeyChord key_chord, ImGuiID owner_id = 0, ImGuiInputFlags flags = 0);`\r\n    - After:  `Shortcut(ImGuiKeyChord key_chord, ImGuiInputFlags flags = 0, ImGuiID owner_id = 0);`\r\n- Inputs (Internals): owner-aware versions of `IsKeyPressed()`, `IsKeyChordPressed()`, `IsMouseClicked()`: swapped last two parameters order in function signatures:\r\n    - Before: `IsKeyPressed(ImGuiKey key, ImGuiID owner_id, ImGuiInputFlags flags = 0);`\r\n    - After:  `IsKeyPressed(ImGuiKey key, ImGuiInputFlags flags, ImGuiID owner_id = 0);`\r\n    - Before: `IsMouseClicked(ImGuiMouseButton button, ImGuiID owner_id, ImGuiInputFlags flags = 0);`\r\n    - After:  `IsMouseClicked(ImGuiMouseButton button, ImGuiInputFlags flags, ImGuiID owner_id = 0);`\r\n- For several reasons those changes makes sense. They were all made before making some of those API public. Only past users of imgui_internal.h with the extra parameters will be affected. Added asserts for valid flags in various functions to detect _some_ misuses, BUT NOT ALL.\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- Windows: `BeginChild()`: fixed visibility of fully clipped child windows and tables from Test Engine.\r\n- Windows: `BeginChild()`: fixed auto-fit calculation when using either (not both) `ResizeX`/`ResizeY` and double-clicking on a border. Calculation incorrectly didn't always account for scrollbar as it assumed the other axis would also be auto-fit. (#1710)\r\n- Inputs: added shortcut and routing system in public API. (#456, #2637)\r\n  - Most of the infrastructure have been in place for a few versions. Recent changes/fixes allowed to make it public.\r\n  - The general idea is that several callers may register interest in a shortcut, and only one owner gets it.\r\n     - in Parent: call Shortcut(Ctrl+S)    // When Parent is focused, only Parent gets the shortcut.\r\n     - in Child1: call Shortcut(Ctrl+S)    // When Child1 is focused, only Child1 gets the shortcut (Child1 overrides Parent shortcuts)\r\n     - in Child2: no call                  // When Child2 is focused, only Parent gets the shortcut.\r\n   - **The whole system is order independent, so if Child1 makes its calls before Parent, results will be identical. This is an important property as it facilitate working with foreign code or larger codebase.**\r\n  - Added `Shortcut()` function. e.g. Using `ImGui::Shortcut(ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_C)` with default policy:\r\n    - checks that CTRL+C is pressed,\r\n    - and that current window is in focus stack,\r\n    - and that no other requests for CTRL+C have been made from higher priority locations (e.g. deeper in the window/item stack).\r\n  - Added `SetNextItemShortcut()` to set a shortcut to locally or remotely press or activate an item (depending on specified routing policy: using `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal` the item shortcut may be executed even if its window is not in focus stack). Items like buttons are not fully activated, in the sense that they get pressed but another active item, e.g. InputText() won't be deactivated.\r\n  - Added routing policies for `Shortcut()`, `SetNextItemShortcut()`: (#456, #2637)\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFocused`: focus stack route (default)\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteActive`: only route to active item\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal`: route globally, unless a focus route claim shame shortcut.\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteAlways`: no routing submission, no routing check.\r\n  - Added other shortcut/routing options: (#456, #2637)\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_Repeat`: for use by Shortcut() and by upcoming rework of various input functions (which are still internal for now).\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_Tooltip`: for `SetNextItemShortcut()` to show a tooltip when hovering item.\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverFocused`: global route takes priority over focus route.\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteOverActive`: global route takes priority over active item.\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteUnlessBgFocused`: global route disabled if no imgui window focused.\r\n    - `ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFromRootWindow`: route evaluated from the point of view of root window rather than current window.\r\n- Inputs: (OSX) Fixes variety of code which inconsistently required using Ctrl instead of Cmd.\r\n  - e.g. Drags/Sliders now use Cmd+Click to input a value. (#4084)\r\n  - Some shortcuts still uses Ctrl on Mac: e.g. Ctrl+Tab to switch windows. (#4828)\r\n- Inputs: (OSX) Ctrl+Left Click alias as a Right click. (#2343) [@haldean, @ocornut]\r\n- Inputs: Fixed `ImGui::GetKeyName(ImGuiKey_None)` from returning \"N/A\" or \"None\" depending on value of IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO. It always returns \"None\".\r\n- Nav: fixed holding Ctrl or gamepad L1 from not slowing down keyboard/gamepad tweak speed. Broken during a refactor refactor for 1.89. Holding Shift/R1 to speed up wasn't broken.\r\n- Tables: fixed cell background of fully clipped row overlapping with header. (#7575, #7041) [@prabuinet]\r\n- Demo: Added \"Inputs & Focus -> Shortcuts\" section. (#456, #2637)\r\n- Demo: Documents: Added shortcuts and renaming tabs/documents. (#7233)\r\n- Examples: Win32+DX9,DX10,DX11,DX12: rework main loop to handle minimization and screen locking without burning resources by running unthrottled code. (#2496, #3907, #6308, #7615)\r\n- Backends: all backends + demo now call `IMGUI_CHECKVERSION()` to verify ABI compatibility between caller code and compiled version of Dear ImGui. If you get an assert it most likely mean you have a build issue, read comments near the assert. (#7568)\r\n- Backends: Win32: undo an assert introduced in 1.90.6 which didn't allow `WndProc` handler to be called before backend initialization. Because of how `::CreateWindow()` calls in `WndProc` it is facilitating to not assert. (#6275) [@MennoVink]\r\n- Backends, Examples: SDL3: updates for latest SDL3 API changes. (#7580) [@kuvaus, @ocornut]\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.6 to 1.90.7 related to the Docking branch:**\r\n\r\n- Docking: *BREAKING* changed signature of `DockSpaceOverViewport()` to allow passing an explicit dockspace id if desired. (#7611)\r\n    - Before: `DockSpaceOverViewport(const ImGuiViewport* viewport = NULL, ImGuiDockNodeFlags flags = 0, ...);`\r\n    - After:  `DockSpaceOverViewport(ImGuiID dockspace_id = 0, const ImGuiViewport* viewport = NULL, ImGuiDockNodeFlags flags = 0, ...);`\r\n  Simply add a leading 0 to your existing calls to DockSpaceOverViewport() if you have any.\r\n- Tables: resizing border hit-rect scales according to current monitor dpi scale.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.6 to 1.90.7 related to the Range-Select branch: (aimed to merge in 1.91)**\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (Breaking) Added `current_selection_size` argument to `BeginMultiSelect()`, optional. Required for shortcut routing so we can e.g. have Escape be used to clear selection then to exit child window.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: fix preventing focus. amend determination of scope_hovered for decorated/non-child windows + avoid stealing NavId.

Thank you, \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- TreeNode: Fixed a layout inconsistency when using a empty/hidden label followed by a `SameLine()` call. (#7505, #282)\r\n```cpp\r\n     Before: TreeNode(\"##Hidden\"); SameLine(); Text(\"Hello\");\r\n             // This was actually incorrect! BUT appeared to look ok with the default style\r\n             // where ItemSpacing.x == FramePadding.x * 2 (it didn't look aligned otherwise).\r\n     After:  TreeNode(\"##Hidden\"); SameLine(0, 0); Text(\"Hello\");\r\n             // This is correct for all values in style.\r\n```\r\n  - With the fix, IF you were successfully using TreeNode(\"\")+SameLine(); you will now have extra spacing between your TreeNode and the following item. You'll need to change the SameLine() call to SameLine(0,0) to remove this extraneous spacing. This seemed like the more sensible fix that's not making things less consistent. (Note: when using this idiom you are likely to also use `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanAvailWidth`).\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n- Windows: Changed default `ClipRect` to extend to windows' left and right borders, instead of adding arbitrary `WindowPadding.x * 0.5f` space on left and right. That ClipRect half-padding was arbitrary/confusing and inconsistent with Y axis. It also made it harder to draw items covering whole window without pushing an extended ClipRect. Some items near windows left and right edge that used to be clipped may be partly more visible. (#3312, #7540, #3756, #6170, #6365)\r\n- Windows: Fixed subsequent `Begin()` append calls from setting last item information for title bar, making it impossible to use IsItemHovered() on a Begin()-to-append, and causing issue bypassing hover detection on collapsed windows. (#7506, #823)\r\n- Fonts: Fixed font ascent and descent calculation when a font hits exact integer values. It is possible that some prior manual use of `ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset` may become duplicate with this fix. (#7399, #7404) [@GamingMinds-DanielC]\r\n- TreeNode: Added `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanTextWidth` to make hitbox and highlight only cover the label. (#6937) [@dimateos]\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: fixed multi-line label display when angle is flipped. (#6917)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: added `style.TableAngledHeadersTextAlign` and corresponding `ImGuiStyleVar_TableAngledHeadersTextAlign` variable. Default to horizontal center. (#6917) [@thedmd, @ocornut]\r\n- ProgressBar: Added support for indeterminate progress bar by passing an animated negative fraction, e.g. ProgressBar(-1.0f * GetTime()). (#5316, #5370, #1901)[@gan74]\r\n- Text, DrawList: Improved handling of long single-line wrapped text. Faster and mitigate issues with reading vertex indexing limits with 16-bit indices. (#7496, #5720)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Detect ES3 contexts on desktop based on version string, to e.g. avoid calling `glPolygonMode()` on them. (#7447) [@afraidofdark, @ocornut]\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Update loader for Linux to support EGL/GLVND. (#7562) [@ShadowNinja, @vanfanel]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added convenience support for Volk via `IMGUI_IMPL_VULKAN_USE_VOLK` define. (you could always use `IMGUI_IMPL_VULKAN_NO_PROTOTYPES` + `ImGui_ImplVulkan_LoadFunctions()` as well). (#6582, #4854) [@adalsteinnh, @kennyalive, @ocornut]\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Fixed text inputs. Re-enable calling `SDL_StartTextInput()`/`SDL_StopTextInput()` as SDL3 no longer enables it by default. (#7452, #6306, #6071, #1953) [@Green-Sky]\r\n- Examples: GLFW+Vulkan, SDL+Vulkan: Added optional support for Volk. (#6582, #4854)\r\n- Examples: GLFW+WebGPU: Added support for WebGPU-native/Dawn (#7435, #7132) [@eliasdaler, @Zelif]\r\n- Examples: GLFW+WebGPU: Renamed `example_emscripten_wgpu/` to `example_glfw_wgpu/`. (#7435, #7132)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.5 to 1.90.6 related to the Docking branch:**\r\n\r\n- Docking: when `io.ConfigDockingWithShift` is enabled, fixed help tooltip erroneously reading `SetNextWindowXXX()` data. (#6709, #4643, #7491) [@ocornut, @cfillion]\r\n- Viewports: fixed outer-right edge of MenuBar clipping rectangle off by one when window is located on a monitor with negative coordinates. (#6861, #2884) [@cfillion]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: reworked swap-chain resize handling for secondary viewports, fix for typical Linux setups. (#2626, #3390, #3758, #7508, #7513) [@RoryO, @InsideBSITheSecond]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: create a custom pipeline for secondary viewports. Fixes issues when user created main viewport uses a different renderpass. (#6325, #6305, #7398, #3459, #3253, #3522) [@skaman, @FunMiles]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90.3 to 1.90.6 related to the Range-Select branch: (previous release notes skipped a few)**\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (Breaking) merge `ImGuiSelectionRequestType_Clear` and `ImGuiSelectionRequestType_SelectAll` into `ImGuiSelectionRequestType_SetAll`, rename `ImGuiSelectionRequest::RangeSelected` to `Selected`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Simplified `ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage` by using a single SetItemSelected() entry point.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoSelect`, `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoAutoClear` features.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Added Checkbox Demo.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: fix preventing focus. amend determination of scope_hovered for decorated/non-child windows + avoid stealing NavId.

The project lost its largest source of income a few months ago. Shortly after I ran into some personal issues that have been emotionally draining. Coincidentally this aligned with a long-time planed trip so it was a good timing to disappear for a little bit. I have attended GDC (thanks to [BeamNG](https://www.beamng.com/game)) in an effort to engage in discussion with some potential sponsors, and generally to engage a little bit of gamedev reality again :)\r\n\r\nI am now back home. I have moved offices. Managed to get some financial contributions ([G3DVu](https://www.g3dvu.com/)!, [Lucid Games](https://www.lucidgames.co.uk)! [Aras](http://aras-p.info/)!) and hopeful that ongoing discussions will eventually allow to fill the gap. Heck, I'm looking into buying a Mac now to get toward settling some of the recurrent scaling/dpi issues.\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui is funded by your contributions and needs them to sustain and grow**.

(#4921)\r\n  - Reminder: `IsKeyPressed(GetKeyIndex(ImGuiKey_XXX))` --> `IsKeyPressed(ImGuiKey_XXX)`\r\n- ImDrawList: Merged the radius_x/radius_y parameters in `AddEllipse()`, `AddEllipseFilled()` and `PathEllipticalArcTo()` into a single ImVec2 parameter. Exceptionally, because those functions were added recently in 1.90, we are not adding inline redirection functions. The transition is easy and should affect few users. (#2743, #7417) [@cfillion]\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Windows: Scrollbar visibility decision uses current size when both size and contents size are submitted by API. (#7252)\r\n- Windows: Double-click to collapse may be disabled via key-ownership mechanism. (#7369)\r\n- Windows: BeginChild(): Extend outer resize borders to the edges when there are no corner grips. Essentially affects resizable child windows. (#7440, #1710) [@cfillion]\r\n- Windows: BeginChild(): Resizing logic for child windows evaluates whether per-axis clamping should be applied based on parent scrollbars, not child scrollbars. (#7440, #1710) [@cfillion] Adjust those resizing limits to match window padding rather than inner clipping rectangle.\r\n- Tables: Fixed auto-width columns when using synced-instances of same table, width of one instance would bleed into next one instead of sharing their widths. (#7218)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: fixed border hit box extending beyond when used within non-scrollable tables. (#7416) [@cfillion]\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: fixed borders not moving back up after `TableAngleHeadersRow()` stops being called. (#7416) [@cfillion]\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: rounding header size to nearest integers, fixes some issues when using clipper.\r\n- Menus, Popups: Fixed an issue where sibling menu popups re-opening in successive frames would erroneously close the window. While it is technically a popup issue it would generally manifest when fast moving the mouse bottom to top in a sub-menu. (#7325, #7287, #7063)\r\n- ProgressBar: Fixed passing fraction==NaN from leading to a crash. (#7451)\r\n- ListBox: Fixed text-baseline offset when using SameLine()+Text() after a labeled `ListBox()`.\r\n- Drags, Sliders, Inputs: Fixed `io.PlatformLocaleDecimalPoint` decimal point localization feature not working regression from 1.90.1. (#7389, #6719, #2278) [@GamingMinds-DanielC]\r\n- Style: Added `ImGuiStyleVar_TabBorderSize`, `ImGuiStyleVar_TableAngledHeadersAngle` for consistency. (#7411) [@cfillion]\r\n- DrawList: Added `AddConcavePolyFilled()`, `PathFillConcave()` concave filling. (#760) [@thedmd] Note that only simple polygons (no self-intersections, no holes) are supported.\r\n- DrawList: Allow `AddText()` to accept null ranges. (#3615, 7391)\r\n- Docs: added more wiki links to headers of imgui.h/imgui.cpp to facilitate discovery\r\n  of interesting resources, because github doesn't allow Wiki to be crawled by search engines.\r\n  - This is the main wiki: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki\r\n  - This is the crawlable version: https://github-wiki-see.page/m/ocornut/imgui/wiki ...

(#7325)\r\n- Fixed focus/tabbing API from working on windows with `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs`, which broke [imgui_memory_editor](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club) in 1.90.2.\r\n- Improvements and fixes for Table Angled Headers mode. (#6917)\r\n- Made `DebugStartItemPicker()` public API and wired to Tools menu. **EVERY TIME I MENTION THE ITEMPICKER TO ANYONE, THEY SAY \"WOW I WISH WE LEARNED ABOUT IT EARLIER\".** (#2673)\r\n- A few more stuff.\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Nav: Fixed `SetKeyboardFocusHere()` or programmatic tabbing APIs from not working on windows with the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs flag (regression in 1.90.2, which among other things broke imgui_memory_editor [#36](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club/issues/36)).\r\n- Menus, Popups: Fixed an issue where hovering a parent-menu upward would erroneously close the window. (#7325, #7287, #7063)\r\n- Popups: Fixed resizable popup minimum size being too small. Standardized minimum size logic. (#7329).\r\n- Modals: Temporary changes of `ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg` are properly handled by `BeginPopupModal()`. (#7340)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: fixed support for multi-line labels. (#6917)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: various fixes to accurately handle CellPadding changes. (#6917)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: properly registers horizontal component of angled headers\r\n  for auto-resizing of columns. (#6917)\r\n- Tables: Angled headers: fixed `TableAngledHeadersRow()` incorrect background fill drawn too low, particularly visible with tables that have no scrolling. (#6917)\r\n- ProgressBar: Fixed a minor tessellation issue when rendering rounded progress bars,\r\n  where in some situations the rounded section wouldn't follow regular tessellation rules.\r\n- Debug Tools: Item Picker: Promoted `ImGui::DebugStartItemPicker()` to public API. (#2673)\r\n- Debug Tools: Item Picker: Menu entry visible in Demo->Tools but greyed out unless  `io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent` is set. (#2673)\r\n- Misc: Added optional alpha multiplier parameter to `GetColorU32(ImU32)` variant.\r\n- Demo: Custom Rendering: better demonstrate `PathArcTo()`, `PathBezierQuadraticCurveTo()`, `PathBezierCubicCurveTo()`, `PathStroke()`, `PathFillConvex()` functions.\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.90.3 to 1.90.4 related to the Docking branch:\r\n\r\n- Backends: GLFW: enable `ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseHoveredViewport` support with GLFW 3.3.x, as required specs for it was relaxed in 1.87. This enable better viewport hovering detection without GLFW 3.4's `GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHROUGH`, with less reliance on dear imgui's own heuristic of platform windows order. (#7316)\r\n\r\nAngled Headers:\r\n![table angled headers 2](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/a87e9e55-791f-4d0c-89fe-6efbdb3a078b)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nAlso see [previous releases details](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases).\r\nNote that GitHub are now clamping release notes sometimes really badly, click on a header/title to read full notes.\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui is funded by your contributions and needs them to sustain and grow**.

In 1.90.1 and 1.90.2, child menus with lots of contents wouldn't get clamped to parent viewport boundaries and therefore wouldn't show a scrollbar.**\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Removed obsolete `ImGui_ImplSDL2_NewFrame(SDL_Window*)` signature which was obsoleted in 1.84. Calling ImGui_ImplSDL2_NewFrame() without parameter is fine.\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Moved RenderPass parameter from `ImGui_ImplVulkan_Init()` function to `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo` structure. Not required when using dynamic rendering. (#7308) [@shawnhatori]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Using dynamic rendering now require filling the `PipelineRenderingCreateInfo` structure in `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo`, allowing to configure color/depth/stencil formats. Removed `ColorAttachmentFormat` field previously provided for dynamic rendering. (#7166, #6855, #5446, #5037) [@shawnhatori]\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Menus, Popups: Fixed menus and popups with ChildWindow flag erroneously not displaying a scrollbar when contents is over parent viewport size. (#7287, #7063) [@ZingBallyhoo]\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Handle gamepad disconnection + fixed increasing gamepad reference counter continuously. Added support for multiple simultaneous gamepads. Added `ImGui_ImplSDL2_SetGamepadMode()` function to select whether to automatically pick\r\n  first available gamepad, all gamepads, or specific gamepads. (#3884, #6559, #6890, #7180) [@ocornut, @lethal-guitar, @wn2000, @bog-dan-ro]\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Fixed gamepad handling. (#7180) [@bog-dan-ro]\r\n- Backends: SDLRenderer3: query newly added `SDL_RenderViewportSet()` to not restore a wrong viewport if none was initially set.\r\n- Backends: DirectX9: Using RGBA format when allowed by the driver to avoid CPU side conversion. (#6575) [@Demonese]\r\n- Internals: Fixed ImFileOpen not working before context is created, preventing creation of a font atlas before main context creation. (#7314, #7315) [@PathogenDavid, @ocornut]\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nAlso see [previous releases details](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases).\r\nNote that GitHub are now clamping release notes sometimes really badly, click on a header/title to read full notes.\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui is funded by your contributions and needs them to sustain and grow**.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently. Remember that our policy is to comment out obsolete names/symbols after 24 months, so at minimum you must update once year to reduce update complexity, but the most frequently you update the easier it will be.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n- Many navigation improvements/fixes (some of them driven by work on remote activation/shortcuts api).\r\n- Debug tools improvements.\r\n- Backends fixes.\r\n- Better input routing features for docked/multi-viewport based applications.\r\n- Many things still under wrap (internal APIs, private branches etc.), sorry! I've been iterating/testing testing some internal features with selected users, but until they are satisfactory I am not promoting them to public API, and not talking much about them in changelog: \r\n  - Input ownership, Input routing, Shortcut APIs.\r\n  - Way to externally modify an active input text buffer.\r\n  - Multi-Select APIs.\r\n  - Typing-Select APIs.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Commented out `ImGuiIO::ImeWindowHandle` obsoleted in 1.87 in favor of writing to `void* ImGuiViewport::PlatformHandleRaw`.\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: `ImGui_ImplWGPU_Init()` now takes a `ImGui_ImplWGPU_InitInfo` structure instead of variety of parameters, allowing for easier further changes. (#7240)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Nav: keyboard/gamepad activation mark widgets as held to give better visual feedback.\r\n- Nav: tweak to logic marking navigated item as hovered when using keyboard, allowing the hover highlight to stay even while another item is activated.\r\n- Nav: Fixed `SetKeyboardFocusHere()` not working when current nav focus is in different scope, regression from 1.90.1 related to code scoping Tab presses to local scope. (#7226) [@bratpilz]\r\n- Nav: Fixed pressing Escape while in a child window with `ImGuiWindowFlags_NavFlattened` flag. (#7237)\r\n- Nav: Improve handling of Alt key to toggle menu so that key ownership may be claimed on individual left/right alt key without interfering with the other.\r\n- Nav, Menus: Fixed click on a `BeginMenu()` followed by right-arrow from making the child menu reopen and flicker (using `ImGuiPopupFlags_NoReopen`).\r\n- Nav: `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs` is tested during scoring so NavFlattened windows can use it.\r\n- Popups: OpenPopup(): added `ImGuiPopupFlags_NoReopen` flag to specifically not close and reopen a popup when it is already open. (#1497, #1533) (Note that this differs from specific handling we already have in place for the case of calling `OpenPopup()` repeatedly every frame: we already didn't reopen in that specific situation, otherwise the effect would be very disastrous in term of confusion, as reopening would steal focus).\r\n- Popups: Slight change to popup closing logic (e.g. after focusing another window) which skipped over popups that are also child windows.\r\n- Combo: Fixed not reusing windows optimally when used inside a popup stack.\r\n- Debug Tools: Metrics: Fixed debug break in `SetShortcutRouting()` not handling `ImGuiMod_Shortcut` redirect.\r\n- Debug Tools: Metrics: Improved Monitors and Viewports minimap display.

(#7236) [@mklefrancois]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Fixed `vkMapMemory()` calls unnecessarily using full buffer size.

(Daniel, Geoffrey, Nathaniel, Martin & more).\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @GamingMinds-DanielC, @PathogenDavid, @sakiodre, for their help with github answers.\r\n\r\nHuge thank you to [all past and present supporters](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Sponsors)!\r\nAlso thanks to [PVS Studio](https://pvs-studio.com) (great static analyzer) for providing us with a license for this project.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nPast releases include [v1.89](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89), [v1.89.1](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.1), [v1.89.2](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.2), [v1.89.3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.3), [v1.89.4](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.4), [v1.89.5](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.5),  [v1.89.6](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.6), [v1.89.7](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.7), [v1.89.8](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.8), [v1.89.9](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.9), [v1.90](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.90) .**We are trying to make more frequent releases.** Because: some people are relying on tagging and auto-generated bindings for other languages. And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently. Remember that our policy is to comment out obsolete names/symbols after 24 months, so at minimum you must update once year to reduce update complexity, but the most frequently you update the easier it will be.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n- New \"Debug Break\" buttons appearing when `io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent` is enabled. See [Debug Tools](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Debug-Tools).\r\n- Can manually input nan/inf values in scalar widgets.\r\n- Native OSX backend (without GLFW/SDL etc) now handle multi-monitors/viewports decently.\r\n- 30+ other improvements fixes.\r\n\r\n![295624845-960de69e-3e7d-467a-b805-a30b1e78bebf](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/7dac1e5b-c7d8-4a6b-b277-85f7edcd348c)\r\n![295626202-b4292cf6-88a9-4f27-a502-a00c38d923e3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/e53ca07d-4fe7-4220-9880-b33fff2d234b)\r\n![295622732-9e70ed99-8598-452f-95cb-3162cc50184a](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/458cbaa8-e6f6-479f-ad2b-2fc72102b68a)\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- imgui_freetype: commented out `ImGuiFreeType::BuildFontAtlas()` obsoleted in 1.81. Prefer using `#define IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE` or see commented code for manual runtime calls.\r\n- Removed CalcListClipping() marked obsolete in 1.86. (#3841). Prefer using `ImGuiListClipper` which can return non-contiguous ranges.\r\n- Internals, Columns: commented out legacy `ImGuiColumnsFlags_XXX` symbols redirecting to `ImGuiOldColumnsFlags_XXX`, obsoleted from imgui_internal.h in 1.80.\r\n- Commented out obsolete `ImGuiKey_KeyPadEnter` redirection to `ImGuiKey_KeypadEnter`. (#2625, #7143)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Windows:\r\n  - `BeginChild()`: Fixed auto-resizing erroneously limiting size to host viewport minus padding. There are no limit to a child width/height. (#7063) [@Devyre]\r\n  - `BeginChild()`: Resize borders rendered even when `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoBackground` is specified. (#1710, #7194)\r\n  - Fixed some auto-resizing path using `style.WindowMinSize.x` (instead of x/y) for both axises since 1.90. (#7106) [@n0bodysec]\r\n  - Scrolling: internal scrolling value is rounded instead of truncated, as a way to reduce speed asymmetry when (incorrectly) attempting to scroll by non-integer amount. (#6677)\r\n- Navigation (Keyboard/gamepad):\r\n  - Nav, IO: `SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard(false)` calls are not overridden back to true when navigation is enabled. SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard()` is always higher priority. (#6997)\r\n  - Nav: Activation can also be performed with Keypad Enter. (#5606)\r\n- Drag and Drop:\r\n  - Fixed drop target highlight on items temporarily pushing a widened ClipRect (namely Selectables and Treenodes using SpanAllColumn flag) so the highlight properly covers all columns. (#7049, #4281, #3272)\r\n- InputText:\r\n  - `InputTextMultiline()`: Fixed Tab character input not repeating (1.89.4 regression).\r\n  - `InputTextMultiline()`: Tabbing through a multi-line text editor which allows Tab character inputs (using the `ImGuiInputTextFlags_AllowTabInput` flag) doesn't automatically activate it, in order to allow passing through multiple widgets easily. (#3092, #5759, #787)\r\n- Drags, Sliders, Inputs:\r\n  - DragScalarN, SliderScalarN, InputScalarN: Fixed incorrect pushes into ItemWidth stack when number of components is 1. [#7095] [@Nahor]\r\n  - Drags, Sliders, Inputs: removed all attempts to filter non-numerical characters during text editing. Invalid inputs not applied to value, visibly reverted after validation. (#6810, #7096)\r\n  - Drags, Sliders, Inputs: removal of filter means that \"nan\" and \"inf\" values may be input. (#7096)\r\n  - DragScalarN, SliderScalarN, InputScalarN, PushMultiItemsWidths: improve multi-components width computation to better distribute the error. (#7120, #7121) [@Nahor]\r\n- Menus:\r\n  - Tweaked hover slack logic, adding an extra timeout to avoid situations where a slow vertical movements toward another parent `BeginMenu()` can keep the wrong child menu open. (#6671, #6926)\r\n- Color Editors:\r\n  - ColorEdit: Layout tweaks for very small sizes. (#7120, #7121)\r\n  - ColorPicker: Fixed saturation/value cursor radius not scaling properly.\r\n- Tabs: Added `ImGuiTabItemFlags_NoAssumedClosure` to enable app to react on closure attempt, without having to draw an unsaved document marker (`ImGuiTabItemFlags_UnsavedDocument` sets `_NoAssumedClosure` automatically). (#7084)\r\n- Debug Tools:\r\n  - Added `io.ConfigDebugIsDebuggerPresent` option. When enabled, this adds buttons in various locations of Metrics/Debugger to manually request a debugger break: (see [Debug Tools](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Debug-Tools) Wiki Page)\r\n    - Request a debug break in a `Begin()` call.\r\n    - Request a debug break in a `ItemAdd()` call via debug log and hovering 0xXXXXXX identifiers.\r\n    - Request a debug break in a `BeginTable()` call.\r\n    - Request a debug break in a `SetShortcutRouting()`/`Shortcut()` call. [Internal]\r\n  - Metrics: Reorganize Tools menu.\r\n  - Added `DebugFlashStyleColor()` to identify a style color. Added to Style Editor.\r\n  - Debug Log: Hide its own clipper log to reduce noise in the output. (#5855)\r\n  - Debug Log: Clicking any filter with SHIFT held enables it for 2 frames only, making it easier when dealing with spammy logs. (#5855)\r\n- Settings: Fixed an issue marking settings as dirty when merely clicking on a border or resize grip without moving it.\r\n- Misc: Added `IMGUI_USER_H_FILENAME` to change the path included when using `IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_H`.. (#7039) [@bryceberger]\r\n- Misc: Rework debug display of texture id in Metrics window to avoid compile-error when ImTextureID is defined to be larger than 64-bits. (#7090)\r\n- Misc: Added extra courtesy ==/!= operators when `IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS` is defined.\r\n- Misc: Fixed text functions fast-path for handling \"%s\" and \"%.*s\" to handle null pointers gracefully, like most printf implementations. (#7016, #3466, #6846) [@codefrog2002]\r\n- Misc: Renamed some defines in imstb_textedit.h to avoid conflicts when using unity/jumbo builds on a codebase where another copy of the library is used.\r\n- Misc: During shutdown, check that `io.BackendPlatformUserData` and `io.BackendRendererUserData` are NULL in order to catch cases where backend was not shut down. (#7175)\r\n- Misc: Reworked Issue Template to a shinier and better form. (#5927) [@Panquesito7, @PathogenDavid, @ocornut]\r\n- Backends:\r\n  - GLFW, Emscripten: Added `ImGui_ImplGlfw_InstallEmscriptenCanvasResizeCallback()` to register canvas selector and auto-resize GLFW window. (#6751) [@Traveller23, @ypujante]\r\n  - GLFW: Fixed Windows specific hooks to use Unicode version of WndProc even when compiling in MBCS mode. (#7174) [@kimidaisuki22]\r\n  - OpenGL3: Update GL3W based imgui_impl_opengl3_loader.h to load libGL.so variants in case of missing symlink. Fix 1.90 regression for some distros. (#6983)\r\n  - Vulkan: Fixed mismatching allocator passed to `vkCreateCommandPool()` vs `vkDestroyCommandPool()`. (#7075) [@FoonTheRaccoon]\r\n  - Vulkan: Added `MinAllocationSize` field in `ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo` to workaround zealous \"best practice\" validation layer. (#7189, #4238) [@philae-ael]\r\n  - Vulkan: Stopped creating command pools with `VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT` as we don't reset them.\r\n  - WebGPU: Fixed `wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetScissorRect()` crash when rendering modal window's dimming layer, which has an unclipped value in `ImDrawCmd::ClipRect`. (#7191) [@aparis69]\r\n- Examples:\r\n  - Examples: GLFW+Emscripten: Fixed examples not consistently resizing according to host canvas. (#6751) [@Traveller23, @ypujante]\r\n  - Examples: SDL3: Minor fixes following recent SDL3 in-progress development.\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90 to 1.90.1 related to the docking branch (multi-viewport and docking features):**\r\n\r\n- Backends: OSX: Fixed monitor and window position by correctly transforming Y origin on multi-viewports multi-monitor setups. (#7028, #7101, #6009, #6432) [@dmirty-kuzmenko, @734vin] \r\n- Backends: OSX: Fixed IME position in multi-monitor multi-viewports setups. (#7028) [@734vin]\r\n- Backends: DX12: Changed swapchain scaling mode to DXGI_SCALING_NONE to reduce artifacts as queued frames aren't synchronized with platform window resizes. (#7152, #7153) [@SuperWangKai]\r\n- Windows: Fixed ImGuiCol_TitleBg/Active alpha being used for viewport-owned windows. (#7181) [@PathogenDavid]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.90 to 1.90.0 related to the range-select branch:**\r\n\r\nThis is a new API that hasn't been discussed much in public yet. Ignore if you are not one of the few users. If you happen to be using this please do get in contact. I know I said this API would have been stabilized by now, but it's not! I expect that the latest major API breaking changes are now done. Hopefully this is on track to be stable and merged in 1.91.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n   <summary>Open for details of Multi-Select/Range-Select changes</summary>\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: support for nested/stacked `BeginMultiSelect()`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: move demo's ExampleSelection to main API as a convenient `ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage` helper.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Added ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoRangeSelect. \r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Fixed ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ScopeRect not querying proper window hover.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: Fixed CTRL+drag from void clearing items.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: Fixed scrolling on high frame-rates.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: Fixed initial drag from not claiming hovered id, preventing window behind to move for a frame.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: Fixed holes when using with clipper (in 1D list).\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Box-Select: Added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect2d` support. Enabled in Asset Browser. Selectable() supports it.\r\n- Demo: Assets Browser: Added deletion support.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently. Remember that our policy is to comment out obsolete names/symbols after 24 months, so at minimum you must update once year to reduce update complexity, but the most frequently you update the easier it will be.\r\n\r\nI have been stubbornly deferring tagging 1.90 for while because I wanted to include the multi-select feature in it. Guess what? It's not done (now scheduled for 1.91)! And because 1.90 changelog is big enough already I'm tagging it now. **There are about 1000 lines of changelog between 1.89 and 1.90.**\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n- Resizable child windows (manual and automatic modes, with support for constraints)!\r\n- Changed `BeginChild()` signature to enable new features: replaced `bool border=false` with `ImGuiChildFlags`, backward compatible.\r\n- Angled table headers!\r\n- Double-clicking on window border to auto-resize on this axis.\r\n- Separators fixes and better standardization with other widgets.\r\n- Tooltips, Drag and Drop, Menus, InputText, Tables, Fonts: many fixes and improvements.\r\n- Docking: revised undocking to reduce accidental whole-node undocking (read details below).\r\n- Docking: fixes some cases of misrestored currently focused tab on application restore.\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Simplification for texture upload (less work by app/user).\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update to latest fluctuating work-in-progress SDL3 api.\r\n- More demo, more debug tools, various non-publicized-yet internal features, many other things!\r\n\r\n_Resizable child windows_\r\n![child_resizable2_with_constraints](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/840ce431-c633-449e-95b6-1de419a4c565)\r\n\r\n_Angled table headers_\r\n![table angled headers 3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/8225057/fc914eb0-10a3-422d-a94d-c0c0744d237a)\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n - BeginChild(): Upgraded `bool border = false` parameter to `ImGuiChildFlags flags = 0`;. Added ImGuiChildFlags_Border value. As with our prior \"bool-to-flags\" API updates, the ImGuiChildFlags_Border value is guaranteed to be == true forever to ensure a smoother transition, meaning all existing calls will still work.\r\n   If you want to neatly transition your call sites:\r\n      - Before:  `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, true)`\r\n      - After:   `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, ImGuiChildFlags_Border)`\r\n      - Before:  `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, false)`\r\n      - After:   `BeginChild(\"Name\", size)` or `BeginChild(\"Name\", 0)` or `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, ImGuiChildFlags_None)`.\r\n - Existing code will still work as `ImGuiChildFlags_Border == true`, but you are encouraged to update call sites.\r\n - BeginChild(): Added child-flag `ImGuiChildFlags_AlwaysUseWindowPadding` as a replacement for the window-flag `ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysUseWindowPadding`: the feature only ever made sense for use with `BeginChild()` anyhow, passing it to Begin() had no effect. Now that we accept child-flags we are moving it there. Kept inline redirection enum (will obsolete later) so existing code will work. (#462)\r\n      - Before:  `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, 0, ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysUseWindowPadding);`\r\n      - After:   `BeginChild(\"Name\", size, ImGuiChildFlags_AlwaysUseWindowPadding, 0);`\r\n- `BeginChildFrame()`/`EndChildFrame()`: removed functions in favor of using `BeginChild()` with the `ImGuiChildFlags_FrameStyle` flag. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). Those functions were merely `PushStyleXXX/PopStyleXXX` helpers and custom versions are easy to create. (The removal isn't so much motivated by needing to add the feature in `BeginChild()`, but by the necessity to avoid `BeginChildFrame()` signature mismatching `BeginChild()` signature and features.)\r\n - Debug Tools: Renamed `ShowStackToolWindow()` (\"Stack Tool\") to `ShowIDStackToolWindow()` (\"ID Stack Tool\"), as earlier name was misleading. Kept inline redirection function. (#4631)\r\n - IO: Removed `io.MetricsActiveAllocations` introduced in 1.63, was displayed in Metrics and unlikely to be accessed by end-user. Value still visible in the UI and easily to recompute from a delta.\r\n - Defining `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` now automatically defines IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO. (#4921)\r\n - Removed `IM_OFFSETOF()` macro in favor of using `offsetof()` available in C++11. Kept redirection define. (#4537)\r\n - ListBox, Combo: Changed signature of \"name getter\" callback in old one-liner ListBox()/Combo() apis.\r\n   - Before:\r\n      - getter type:   `bool (*getter)(void* user_data, int idx, const char** out_text)`\r\n      - function:      `bool Combo(const char* label, int* current_item, bool (*getter)(void* user_data, int idx, const char** out_text), ...);`\r\n      - function:      `bool ListBox(const char* label, int* current_item, bool (*getting)(void* user_data, int idx, const char** out_text), ...);`\r\n   - After:\r\n      - getter type:   `const char* (*getter)(void* user_data, int idx)`\r\n      - function:      `bool Combo(const char* label, int* current_item, const char* (*getter)(void* user_data, int idx), ...);`\r\n      - function:      `bool ListBox(const char* label, int* current_item, const char* (*getter)(void* user_data, int idx), ...);`\r\n    - Old type was unnecessarily complex and harder to wrap in e.g. a lambda. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).\r\n - Commented out obsolete redirecting enums/functions that were marked obsolete two years ago:\r\n   - `GetWindowContentRegionWidth()` -> use `GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetWindowContentRegionMin().x`. Consider that generally `GetContentRegionAvail().x` is often more correct and more useful.\r\n   - `ImDrawCornerFlags_XXX` -> use `ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersXXX` names. Read [1.82 changelog](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.82) for details + grep commented names in sources.\r\n   - Commented out runtime support for hardcoded ~0 or 0x01..0x0F rounding flags values for `AddRect()`/`AddRectFilled()`/`PathRect()`/`AddImageRounded()`. -> Use `ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersXXX` flags. Read [1.82 changelog](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.82) for details.\r\n - Backends: Vulkan: Removed parameter from `ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture()`: backend now creates its own command-buffer to upload fonts. Removed `ImGui_ImplVulkan_DestroyFontUploadObjects()` which is now unnecessary. No need to call `ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture()` as it is done automatically in `ImGui_ImplVulkan_NewFrame()`. You can call `ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture()` manually if you need to reload the font atlas texture. (#6943, #6715, #6327, #3743, #4618)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Windows:\r\n  - BeginChild(): Added `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeX` and `ImGuiChildFlags_ResizeY` to allow resizing child windows from the bottom/right border (toward layout direction). Resized child windows settings are saved and persistent in .ini file. (#1710)\r\n  - BeginChild(): Added `ImGuiChildFlags_Border` as a replacement for 'bool border = true' parameter.\r\n  - BeginChild(): Added `ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeX` and `ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeY` to auto-resize on one axis, while generally providing a size on the other axis. (#1666, #1395, #1496, #1710) e.g. `BeginChild(\"name\", {-FLT_MIN, 0.0f}, ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeY);`\r\n    - Size is only reevaluated if the child window is within visible boundaries or just appearing. This allows coarse clipping to be performed and auto-resizing childs to return false when hidden because of being scrolled out.\r\n    - Combining this with also specifying `ImGuiChildFlags_AlwaysAutoResize` disables this optimization, meaning child contents will never be clipped (not recommended).\r\n    - Please be considerate that child are full windows and carry significant overhead: combining auto-resizing for both axises to create a non-scrolling child to merely draw a border would be better more optimally using `BeginGroup()`. (until we come up with new helpers for framed groups and work-rect adjustments, see #1496).\r\n  - BeginChild(): made it possible to use `SetNextWindowSizeConstraints()` rectangle, often useful when `ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeX` or `ImGuiChildFlags_AutoResizeY`. (#1666, #1395, #1496) Custom constraint callback are not supported with child window.\r\n  - BeginChild(): Added `ImGuiChildFlags_FrameStyle` as a replacement for `BeginChildFrame()`, use it to make child window use FrameBg, FrameRounding, FrameBorderSize, FramePadding instead of ChildBg, ChildRounding, ChildBorderSize, WindowPadding.\r\n  - Popups: clarified meaning of `p_open != NULL` in `BeginPopupModal()` + set back user value to false when popup is closed in ways other than clicking the close button. (#6900)\r\n  - Double-clicking lower-left resize grip auto-resize (like lower-right one).\r\n  - Double-clicking bottom or right window border auto-resize on a singles axis.\r\n  - Use relative mouse movement for border resize when the border geometry has moved (e.g. resizing a child window triggering parent scroll) in order to avoid resizing feedback loops. Unless manually mouse-wheeling while border resizing. (#1710)\r\n- Separators:\r\n  - Altered end-points to use more standard boundaries. (#205, #4787, #1643) Left position is always current cursor X position, right position is always work-rect rightmost edge. It effectively means that:\r\n    - A separator in the root of a window will end up a little more distant from edges than previously (essentially following `WindowPadding` instead of clipping edges).\r\n    - A separator inside a table cell end up a little distance from edges instead of touching them (essentially following `CellPadding` instead of clipping edges).\r\n    - Matches tree indentation (was not the case before).\r\n    - Matches `SeparatorText()`. (#1643)\r\n    - Makes things correct inside groups without specific/hard-coded handling. (#205)\r\n  - Support legacy behavior when used inside old `Columns()`, as we favored that idiom back then, only different is left position follows indentation level, to match calling a `Separator()` inside or outside Columns().\r\n- Tooltips:\r\n  - Made using `SetItemTooltip()`/`IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_ForTooltip)` defaults to activate tooltips on disabled items. This is done by adding `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenDisabled` to the default value of `style.HoverFlagsForTooltipMouse`/`style.HoverFlagsForTooltipNav`. (#1485)\r\n  - Made is possible to combine `ImGuiHoveredFlags_ForTooltip` with a `ImGuiHoveredFlags_DelayXXX` override. (#1485)\r\n- Drag and Drop:\r\n  - Reworked drop target highlight: reduce rectangle to its visible portion, and then expand slightly. A full rectangle is always visible and it may protrude slightly. (#4281, #3272)\r\n  - Fixed submitting a tooltip from drop target location when using `AcceptDragDropPayload()` with `ImGuiDragDropFlags_AcceptNoPreviewTooltip` and submitting a tooltip manually.\r\n- Tables:\r\n  - Added angled headers support. You need to set `ImGuiTableColumnFlags_AngledHeader` on selected\r\n    columns and call `TableAngledHeadersRow()`. Added `style.TableAngledHeadersAngle` style option.\r\n  - Added `ImGuiTableFlags_HighlightHoveredColumn` flag, currently highlighting column header.\r\n  - Fixed an edge-case when no columns are visible + table scrollbar is visible + user code is always testing return value of `TableSetColumnIndex()` to coarse clip. With an active clipper it would have asserted. Without a clipper, the scrollbar range would be wrong.\r\n  - Request user to submit contents when outer host-window is requesting auto-resize, so a scrolling table can contribute to initial window size. (#6510)\r\n  - Fixed subtle drawing overlap between borders in some situations.\r\n  - Fixed bottom-most and right-most outer border offset by one. (#6765, #3752) [@v-ein]\r\n  - Fixed top-most and left-most outer border overlapping inner clip-rect when scrolling. (#6765)\r\n  - Fixed top-most outer border being drawn with both `TableBorderLight` and `TableBorderStrong` in some situations, causing the earlier to be visible underneath when alpha is not 1.0f.\r\n  - Fixed right-clicking right-most section (past right-most column) from highlighting a column.\r\n  - Fixed an issue with `ScrollX` enabled where an extraneous draw command would be created.\r\n- Menus:\r\n  - Menus: Fixed a bug where activating an item in a child-menu and dragging mouse over the parent-menu would erroneously close the child-menu. (Regression from 1.88). (#6869)\r\n  - MenuBar: Fixed an issue where layouting an item in the menu-bar would erroneously register contents size in a way that would affect the scrolling layer. Was most often noticeable when using an horizontal scrollbar. (#6789)\r\n- InputText:\r\n  - `InputTextMultiline()`: Fixed a crash pressing Down on last empty line of a multi-line buffer. (regression from 1.89.2, only happened in some states). (#6783, #6000)\r\n  - `InputTextMultiline(): Fixed Tabbing cycle leading to a situation where Enter key wouldn't be accepted by the widget when navigation highlight is visible. (#6802, #3092, #5759, #787)\r\n- Nav: Tabbing always enable nav highlight when `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard` is set. Previously was inconsistent and only enabled when stepping through a non-input item. (#6802, #3092, #5759, #787)\r\n- TreeNode: Added `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanAllColumns` for use in tables. (#3151, #3565, #2451, #2438)\r\n- TabBar: Fixed position of unsaved document marker (`ImGuiTabItemFlags_UnsavedDocument`) which was accidentally offset in 1.89.9. (#6862) [@alektron]\r\n- ColorPicker4(): Fixed `ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoTooltip` not being forwarded to individual DragFloat3 sub-widgets which have a visible color preview when `ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoSidePreview` is also set. (#6957)\r\n- BeginGroup(): Fixed a bug pushing line lower extent too far down when called after a call to `SameLine()` followed by manual cursor manipulation.\r\n- BeginCombo(): Added `ImGuiComboFlags_WidthFitPreview` flag. (#6881) [@mpv-enjoyer]\r\n- BeginListBox(): Fixed not consuming `SetNextWindowXXX()` data when returning false.\r\n- Fonts:\r\n  - Argument `float size_pixels` passed to `AddFontXXX()` functions is now rounded to lowest integer. This is because our layout/font system currently doesn't fully support non-integer sizes. Until it does, this has been a common pitfall leading to more or less subtle issues. (#3164, #3309, #6800)\r\n  - Better assert during load when passing truncated font data or wrong data size. (#6822)\r\n  - Ensure calling AddFontXXX function doesn't invalidates ImFont's ConfigData pointers prior to building again. (#6825)\r\n  - Added `ImFontConfig::RasterizerDensity` field to increase texture size of rendered glyphs without altering other metrics. Among other things, this makes it easier to have zooming code swapping between 2 fonts (e.g. a 100% and a 400% fonts) depending on current scale. (#6925) [@thedmd] Important: if you increase this it is expected that you would render the font with a scale of\r\n    similar value or magnitude. Merely increasing this without increasing scale may lower quality.\r\n  - imgui_freetype: Added support for `ImFontConfig::RasterizerDensity`. (#6925) [@thedmd]\r\n  - imgui_freetype: Fixed a warning and leak in `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE_LUNASVG` support. (#6842, #6591)\r\n- Inputs: Added `IsKeyChordPressed()` helper function e.g. `IsKeyChordPressed(ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_S)`. (note that `ImGuiMod_Shortcut` may be used as an alias for Cmd on OSX and Ctrl on other systems).\r\n- Misc: Most text functions also treat `\"%.*s\"` (along with `\"%s\"`) specially to bypass formatting.

Removed `ImGui_ImplVulkan_DestroyFontUploadObjects()` which is now unnecessary. No need to call `ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture()` as it is done automatically in `ImGui_ImplVulkan_NewFrame()`. You can call ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture() manually if you need to reload font atlas texture. Fixed leaks, and added `ImGui_ImplVulkan_DestroyFontsTexture()` (probably no need to call this directly).

While it is expected that other small issues with arise from this situation, at the moment we are fixing the most noticeable one. (#6861, #2884) [@Vuhdo, @alektron]\r\n- Docking: revised undocking to reduce accidental whole-node undocking:\r\n  - cannot undock a whole node by dragging from empty space in tab-bar.\r\n  - can undock whole node by dragging from window/collapse menu button.\r\n  - can undock single window by dragging from its tab.\r\n  - can still move (but not undock) whole node or whole hierarchy when node is part of a floating hierarchy.\r\n  - added tooltip when hovering the collapse/window menu button, to facilitate understanding that whole dock node may be undocked or grabbed from here.\r\n- Docking: Fixed an issue leading to incorrect restoration of selected tab in dock nodes that don't carry the currently focused window. (#2304)\r\n- Docking: added `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoUndocking`. (#2999, #6823, #6780, #3492)\r\n- Docking: renamed `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoSplit` to `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoDockingSplit`.\r\n- Docking: renamed `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoDockingInCentralNode` to `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoDockingOverCentralNode`.\r\n- Docking: Internals: renamed `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoDockingSplitMe` to `ImGuiDockNodeFlags_NoDockingSplit`.\r\n- Docking: Fixed a bug where ClassId compare tests (when using `SetNextWindowClass`) on success would prevent further filter from running, namely the one that prevent docking over a popup.\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed an assertion in situation where the WndProc handler is different between main and secondary viewport (may happen due to third-party hooks). (#6889)\r\n- Backends: DX9: Fixed incorrect assert triggering on reopening session with minimized windows. (#3424)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.9 to 1.90.0 related to the prototype range-select branch:**\r\n\r\nThis is a new API that hasn't been discussed much in public yet. Ignore if you are not one of the few users. If you happen to be using this please do get in contact. I know I said this API would have been stabilized by now, but it's not! I expect that the latest major API breaking changes are now done. Hopefully this is on track to be stable and merged in 1.91.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n   <summary>Open for details of Multi-Select/Range-Select changes</summary>\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (Breaking) ImGuiMultiSelectIO now contains a `ImVector<ImGuiSelectionRequest>` list. This api will allow box-selection to work. (see a1e85e0).\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (breaking) renamed `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnClickWindowVoid` to `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnClickVoid`. \r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added support for nested/stacked BeginMultiSelect().\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ScopeWindow`, `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ScopeRect` to override/specify scope.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added support for `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_BoxSelect` (doesn't work well with clipper yet).\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: added support for missing `EndMultiSelect()` recovery in `ErrorCheckEndWindowRecover()`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: clarified purpose and use of `IsItemToggledSelection()`. Added assert. Moved to multi-selection section of imgui.h.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: demo: rework and move selection adapter inside `ExampleSelection`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: various internal fixes/improvements.\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this changelog!\r\n\r\n## New exciting projects!\r\n\r\nSince 1.89 we semi-sneakily soft launched two new entire projects!\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui Automation/Test Engine & Test Suite**\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine\r\n\r\n**Dear Bindings: alternative binding generator for C and other languages** by @ShironekoBen (as an alternative to good old [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)).\r\nhttps://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings\r\n\r\nSome interesting new third-party projects:\r\n- [imgui-uwp](https://github.com/ahmed605/imgui-uwp): UWP backend, by @ahmed605\r\n- [Cog](github/arnaud-jamin/Cog): a set of debug tools for Unreal Engine built on top of Dear ImGui, by @arnaud-jamin.\r\n- [imgui_bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) by @pthom: \"easily create ImGui applications in Python and C++.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nI have been stubbornly deferring tagging 1.90 for while because I wanted to include the range-select feature in it, but it's not done... **But there are about 650 lines of changelog between 1.89 and 1.89.9.**\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Clipper: Renamed `IncludeRangeByIndices()` (also called `ForceDisplayRangeByIndices()` before 1.89.6) again to IncludeItemsByIndex(). Kept inline redirection function. (#6424, #3841)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Tables: Made it possible to use `SameLine(0,0)` after `TableNextColumn()`/`TableSetColumnIndex()` in order to reuse line pos/height from previous cell. (#3740)\r\n- Tables: Made it possible to change `style.CellPadding.y` between rows. (#3740)\r\n- Nav, TreeNode: Pressing Left with `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NavLeftJumpsBackHere` now goes through proper navigation logic: honor scrolling and selection. (#1079, #1131)\r\n- Sliders: Fixed an integer overflow and div-by-zero in `SliderInt()` when `v_max=INT_MAX`. (#6675, #6679) [@jbarthelmes]\r\n- Windows: Layout of Close/Collapse buttons uses `style.ItemInnerSpacing.x` between items, stopped incorrectly using `FramePadding` in a way where hit-boxes could overlap when setting large values. (#6749)\r\n- InputFloat, SliderFloat, DragFloat: always turn both `.` and `,` into the current decimal point character when using Decimal/Scientific character filter. (#6719, #2278) [@adamsepp]\r\n- ColorEdit, ColorPicker: Manipulating options popup don't mark item as edited. (Note that they may still be marked as Active/Hovered.) (#6722)\r\n- Clipper: Added `IncludeItemByIndex()` helper to include a single item. (#6424, #3841)\r\n- Clipper: Fixed a bug if attempt to force-include a range which matches an already included range, clipper would end earlier. (#3841)\r\n- **ImDrawData: Fixed an issue where `TotalVtxCount`/`TotalIdxCount` does not match the sum of individual ImDrawList's buffer sizes when a dimming/modal background is rendered.** (#6716)\r\n- ImDrawList: Automatically calling `ChannelsMerge()` if not done after a split.\r\n- ImDrawList: Fixed OOB access in `_CalcCircleAutoSegmentCount()` when passing excessively large radius to `AddCircle()`. (#6657, #5317) [@EggsyCRO, @jdpatdiscord]\r\n- IO: Exposed `io.PlatformLocaleDecimalPoint` to configure decimal point ('.' or ',') for languages needing it. Should ideally be set to the value of `*localeconv()->decimal_point` but our backends don't do it yet. (#6719, #2278)\r\n- IO: Fixed `io.AddMousePosEvent()` and `io.AddMouseButtonEvent()` writing MouseSource to wrong union section. Was semantically incorrect and accidentally had no side-effects with default compiler alignment settings. (#6727) [@RickHuang2001]\r\n- Misc: Made multiple calls to Render() during the same frame early out faster.\r\n- Debug Tools: Metrics: Fixed \"Drawlists\" section and per-viewport equivalent appearing empty (regression in 1.89.8).\r\n- Demo: Reorganized \"Examples\" menu.\r\n- Demo: Tables: Demonstrate using `SameLine()` between cells. (#3740)\r\n- Demo: Tables: Demonstrate altering `CellPadding.y` between rows. (#3740)\r\n- Demo: Custom Rendering: Demonstrate out-of-order rendering using `ImDrawListSplitter`.\r\n- Backends: SDL2,SDL3: added `ImGui_ImplSDL2_InitForOther()`/`ImGui_ImplSDL3_InitForOther()` for consistency (matching GLFW backend) and as most initialization paths don't actually need to care about rendering backend.\r\n- Examples: Emscripten+WebGPU: Fixed WGPUInstance creation process + use preferred framebuffer format.

(#6709, #4643)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.8 to 1.89.9 related to the prototype range-select branch:**\r\n\r\nThis is a new API that hasn't been discussed much in public yet. Ignore if you are not one of the few users. If you happen to be using this please do get in contact. I know I said this API would have been stabilized by now, but it's not!

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nI have been stubbornly deferring tagging 1.90 for while because I wanted to include the range-select feature in it, but it's not done... **But there are about 600 lines of changelog between 1.89 and 1.89.8.**\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- IO: Obsoleted `io.ClearInputCharacters()` (added in 1.47) as it now ambiguous and often incorrect/misleading considering the existence of a higher-level input queue. This is automatically cleared by `io.ClearInputsKeys()`. (#4921)\r\n- ImDrawData: `CmdLists[]` array is now owned, changed from `ImDrawList**` to `ImVector<ImDrawList*>`. Majority of users shouldn't be affected, but you cannot compare to NULL nor reassign manually anymore. Instead use `AddDrawList()`. Allocation count are identical. (#6406, #4879, #1878)\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Fonts: `ImFontConfig::OversampleH` now defaults to 2 instead of 3, since the quality increase is largely minimal.\r\n- Fonts, imgui_freetype: Added support to render OpenType SVG fonts using lunasvg. Requires enabling `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE_LUNASVG` along with `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE`, and providing headers/libraries for lunasvg. (#6591, #6607) [@sakiodre]\r\n- `ImDrawData: CmdLists[]` array is now an ImVector<> owned by ImDrawData rather than a pointer to internal state.\r\n  - This makes it easier for user to create their own or append to an existing draw data. Added a `ImDrawData::AddDrawList()` helper function to do that. (#6406, #4879, #1878)\r\n  - This makes it easier to perform a deep-swap instead of a deep-copy, as array ownership is now clear. (#6597, #6475, #6167, #5776, #5109, #4763, #3515, #1860)\r\n  - Syntax and allocation count are otherwise identical.\r\n- Fixed CTRL+Tab dimming background assert when target window has a callback in the last `ImDrawCmd`. (#4857, #5937)\r\n- IsItemHovered: Fixed `ImGuiHoveredFlags_ForTooltip` for Keyboard/Gamepad navigation, got broken prior to 1.89.7 due to an unrelated change making flags conflict. (#6622, #1485)\r\n- InputText: Fixed a case where deactivation frame would write to underlying buffer or call `CallbackResize` although unnecessary, in a frame where the return value was false.\r\n- Tables: fixed `GetContentRegionAvail().y` report not taking account of lower cell padding or of using `ImGuiTableFlags_NoHostExtendY`. Not taking it into account would make the idiom of creating vertically bottom-aligned content (e.g. a child window) inside a table make the parent window erroneously have a scrollbar. (#6619)\r\n- Tables: fixed calculation of multi-instance shared decoration/scrollbar width of scrolling tables, to avoid flickering width variation when resizing down a table hosting a child window. (#5920, #6619)\r\n- Scrollbar: layout needs to take account of window border size, so a border size will slightly reduce scrollbar size. Generally we tried to make it that window border size has no incidence on layout but this can't work with thick borders. (#2522)\r\n- IO: Added `io.ClearEventsQueue()` to clear incoming inputs events. (#4921)\r\n  May be useful in conjunction with `io.ClearInputsKeys()` if you need to clear both current inputs state and queued events (e.g. when using blocking native dialogs such as Windows's ::MessageBox() or ::GetOpenFileName()).\r\n- IO: Changed `io.ClearInputsKeys()` specs to also clear current frame character buffer (what now obsoleted `io.ClearInputCharacters()` did), as this is effectively the desirable behavior.\r\n- Misc: Added `IMGUI_DISABLE_STB_SPRINTF_IMPLEMENTATION` config macro to disable stb_sprintf implementation when using IMGUI_USE_STB_SPRINTF. (#6626) [@septag]\r\n- Misc: Avoid stb_textedit.h reincluding string.h while in a namespace, which messes up with building with Clang Modules. (#6653, #4791) [@JohelEGP]\r\n- Demo: Better showcase use of `SetNextItemAllowOverlap()`. (#6574, #6512, #3909, #517)\r\n- Demo: Showcase a few more `InputText()` flags.\r\n- Backends: Made all backends sources files support global `IMGUI_DISABLE`. (#6601)\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Revert ignoring mouse data on `GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED` as it can be used differently. User may set `ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouse` if desired. (#5625, #6609) [@scorpion-26]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Update for changes in Dawn. (#6602, #6188) [@williamhCode]\r\n- Examples: Vulkan: Creating minimal descriptor pools to fit only what is needed by example. (#6642) [@SaschaWillem]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.7 to 1.89.8 related to the docking branch (multi-viewport and docking features):**\r\n\r\n- Docking, Style: resizing separators use same colors as window borders (`ImGuiCol_Border`) for consistency. With default styles it doesn't make a big difference. (#2522) [@rmitton] In the future if we promote using thick value for inner/outer docking padding we may need to introduce new colors for it.\r\n- Docking: added `style.DockingSeparatorSize`, `ImGuiStyleVar_DockingSeparatorSize`. Now also scaled by `style.ScaleAllSizes()`. (#3481, #4721, #2522) [@PossiblyAShrub, @wobbier]\r\n- Docking: fixed rendering of docked-window scrollbar above outer border. (#2522)\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.7 to 1.89.8 related to the range-select branch:**\r\n\r\nThis is hopefully the last batch of breaking changes before merging this in 1.90:\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (BREAKING) `BeginMultiSelect()` doesn't need two last params maintained by users.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nI have been stubbornly deferring tagging 1.90 for while because I wanted to include the range-select feature in it, but it's not done... **But there are about 540 lines of changelog between 1.89 and 1.89.7.**\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Moved `io.HoverDelayShort`/`io.HoverDelayNormal` to `style.HoverDelayShort`/`style.HoverDelayNormal`. As the fields were added in 1.89 and expected to be left unchanged by most users, or only tweaked once during app initialization, we are exceptionally accepting the breakage. Majority of users are likely to not even notice.\r\n- Overlapping items: (#6512, #3909, #517)\r\n  - Obsoleted `SetItemAllowOverlap()`: it didn't and couldn't work reliably since 1.89 (2022-11-15), and relied on ambiguously defined design. Use `SetNextItemAllowOverlap()` before item instead.\r\n  - Added `SetNextItemAllowOverlap()` (called before an item) as a replacement for using `SetItemAllowOverlap()` (called after an item). This is roughly equivalent to using the legacy `SetItemAllowOverlap()` call (public API) + `ImGuiButtonFlags_AllowOverlap` (internal).\r\n  - Renamed 'ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap` to `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlap` for consistency.\r\n  - Renamed `ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowItemOverlap` to `ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowOverlap` for consistency. \r\n  - Kept redirecting enums (will obsolete).\r\n\r\n**Other Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Tooltips/IsItemHovered() related changes:\r\n  - Tooltips: Added `SetItemTooltip()` and `BeginItemTooltip()` helper functions.\r\n    They are shortcuts for the common idiom of using `IsItemHovered()`.\r\n    - `SetItemTooltip(\"Hello\")` == `if (IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_Tooltip)) { SetTooltip(\"Hello\"); }`\r\n    - `BeginItemTooltip()` == `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_Tooltip) && BeginTooltip()`\r\n    The newly added `ImGuiHoveredFlags_Tooltip` is meant to facilitate standardizing mouse hovering delays and rules for a given application. The previously common idiom of using 'if (IsItemHovered()) { SetTooltip(...); }' won't use delay or stationary test.\r\n  - IsItemHovered: Added `ImGuiHoveredFlags_Stationary` to require mouse being stationary when hovering a new item. Added `style.HoverStationaryDelay` (~0.15 sec). Once the mouse has been stationary once the state is preserved for same item. (#1485)\r\n  - IsItemHovered: Added `ImGuiHoveredFlags_ForTooltip` as a shortcut for pulling flags from `style.HoverFlagsForTooltipMouse` or `style.HoverFlagsForTooltipNav` depending on active inputs. (#1485)\r\n    - `style.HoverFlagsForTooltipMouse` defaults to `ImGuiHoveredFlags_Stationary | ImGuiHoveredFlags_DelayShort`.\r\n    - `style.HoverFlagsForTooltipNav` defaults to `ImGuiHoveredFlags_NoSharedDelay | ImGuiHoveredFlags_DelayNormal`.\r\n  - Tooltips: Tweak default offset for non-drag and drop tooltips so underlying items isn't covered as much. (Match offset for drag and drop tooltips)\r\n  - IsItemHovered: Tweaked default value of `style.HoverDelayNormal` from 0.30 to 0.40, Tweaked default value of `style.HoverDelayShort` from 0.10 to 0.15. (#1485)\r\n  - IsItemHovered: Added `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlappedByWindow` to ignore window-overlap only. Option  `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped` now expand into a combination of both `_AllowWhenOverlappedByWindow` + `_AllowWhenOverlappedByItem`, matching old behavior.\r\n- Overlapping items: (#6512, #3909, #517)\r\n  - Most item types should now work with `SetNextItemAllowOverlap()`. (#6512, #3909, #517)\r\n  - Fixed first frame of an overlap highlighting underlying item if previous frame didn't hover anything.\r\n  - IsItemHovered: Changed to return false when querying an item using AllowOverlap mode which is being overlapped. Added `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlappedByItem` to opt-out. (#6512, #3909, #517)\r\n  - Selectable, TreeNode: When using `ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowOverlap`/`ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlap` and holding item held, overlapping widgets won't appear as hovered. (#6512, #3909)\r\n- IsWindowHovered: Added support for `ImGuiHoveredFlags_Stationary`.\r\n- IsWindowHovered, IsItemHovered: Assert when passed any unsupported flags.\r\n- Tables: Fixed a regression in 1.89.6 leading to the first column of tables with either ScrollX or ScrollY flags from being impossible to resize. (#6503)\r\n- CollapsingHeader/TreeNode: Fixed text padding when using _Framed+_Leaf flags. (#6549) [@BobbyAnguelov]\r\n- InputText: Fixed not returning true when buffer is cleared while using the `ImGuiInputTextFlags_EscapeClearsAll` flag. (#5688, #2620)\r\n- InputText: Fixed a crash on deactivating a ReadOnly buffer. (#6570, #6292, #4714)\r\n- InputText: `ImGuiInputTextCallbackData::InsertChars()` accept (NULL,NULL) range, in order to conform to common idioms (e.g. passing .data(), .data() + .size() from a null string). (#6565, #6566, #3615)\r\n- Combo: Made simple/legacy Combo() function not returns true when picking already selected item. This is consistent with other widgets. If you need something else, you can use `BeginCombo()`. (#1182)\r\n- Clipper: Rework inner logic to allow functioning with a zero-clear constructor. This is order to facilitate usage for language bindings (e.g cimgui or dear_binding) where user may not be calling a constructor manually. (#5856)\r\n- Drag and Drop: Apply default behavior of drag source not reporting itself as hovered at lower-level, so DragXXX, SliderXXX, InputXXX, Plot widgets are fulfilling it. (Behavior doesn't apply when `ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceNoDisableHover` is set).\r\n- Modals: In the case of nested modal, made sure that focused or appearing windows are moved below the lowest blocking modal (rather than the highest one). (#4317)\r\n- GetKeyName(): Fixed assert with `ImGuiMod_XXX` values when `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO` is set.\r\n- Debug Tools: Added `io.ConfigDebugIniSettings` option to save .ini data with extra comments. Currently mainly for inspecting Docking .ini data, but makes saving slower.\r\n- Demo: Added more developed `Widgets->Tooltips` section. (#1485)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed support for `glBindSampler()` backup/restore on ES3. (#6375, #6508) [@jsm174]\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed erroneous use `glGetIntegerv(GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK)` on contexts lower than 3.2. (#6539, #6333) [@krumelmonster]\r\n- Backends: Vulkan: Added optional support for `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` (Vulkan 1.3+) in the backend, for applications using it. User needs to set `init_info->UseDynamicRendering = true` and `init_info->ColorAttachmentFormat`. RenderPass becomes unused. (#5446, #5037) [@spnda, @cmarcelo]\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Accept `glfwGetTime()` not returning a monotonically increasing value. This seems to happens on some Windows setup when peripherals disconnect, and is likely to also happen on browser+Emscripten. Matches similar 1.89.4 fix in SDL backend. (#6491)\r\n- Examples: Win32+OpenGL3: Changed `DefWindowProc()` to `DefWindowProcW()` to match other examples\r\n  and support the example app being compiled without UNICODE. (#6516, #5725, #5961, #5975) [@yenixing]\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.6 to 1.89.7 related to the docking branch (multi-viewport and docking features):**\r\n\r\n- Viewports+Docking: Fixed extraneous viewport+platform-window recreation in various combination of showing or hiding windows, docking with/without split, undocking. While with some backends and without OS decorations, some extraneous window recreation were visibly not noticeable, they would typically become noticeable when enabling OS decorations on those windows (e.g. Windows title bar fade-in/animation).\r\n- Viewports: Closing a viewport via OS/platform means (e.g. OS close button or task-bar menu), mark all windows in this viewport as closed.\r\n- Docking: Fixed one-frame flickering on reappearing windows binding to a dock node where a later-submitted window was already bound.\r\n- Docking: Fixed dragging from title-bar empty space (regression from 1.88 related to keeping ID alive when calling low-level `ButtonBehavior()` directly). (#5181, #2645)\r\n- Docking: [Internal] `DockBuilderDockWindow()` API calls don't clear docking order if the target node is same as existing one.\r\n- Backends: Win32: Added support for changing `ParentViewportID` after viewport creation.\r\n\r\n**Changes from 1.89.6 to 1.89.7 related to the range-select branch: (aimed to finish, apply some api changes and merge in 1.90):**\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (BREAKING) In ImGuiMultiSelectIO, renamed \"RangeSrc\" -> \"RangeSrcItem\", \"RangeDst\" -> \"RangeDstItem\". \"RangeValue\" -> \"RangeSelected\". This is designed to make things more consistent with upcoming features and polish/merge of the branch.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Removed the need for polling `IsItemToggledSelection()` and toggling per-item selection. This can now be completely handled by the BeginMultiSelect() and EndMultiSelect() requests.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Removed `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_NoUnselect` because I currently can't find use for this specific design.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Update various comments. Simplified/tidied up internal code.\r\n\r\n## New exciting projects!\r\n\r\nSince 1.89 we semi-sneakily soft launched two new entire projects!\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui Automation/Test Engine & Test Suite**\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine\r\n\r\n**Dear Bindings: alternative binding generator for C and other languages** by @ShironekoBen (as an alternative to good old [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)).\r\nhttps://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\nBelow a selection of screenshots from [Gallery threads](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/6478)...\r\n\r\n@eleriaqueen: _\"WIP modding tool for a somewhat retro game made with my limited programming knowledge and skills.\"_\r\n![Screenshot_20230530_204531](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/assets/4411178/7282e6d8-897e-472f-8e40-a48a1ef94700)\r\n\r\n@alipbcs: _\"I used ImGui, ImPlot, and imnodes in my hobby real-time renderer.

See [Sponsors page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Sponsors) for details.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to [v1.89](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89), [v1.89.1](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.1), [v1.89.2](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.2), [v1.89.3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.3), [v1.89.4](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.4), [v1.89.5](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.5). **We are trying to make more frequent releases.** Because: some people are relying on tagging and auto-generated bindings for other languages. And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nI have been stubbornly deferring tagging 1.90 for while because I wanted to include the range-select feature in it, but it's not done... **But there are nearly 500 lines of changelog between 1.89 and 1.89.6.**\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Clipper: Commented out obsolete redirection constructor which was marked obsolete in 1.79: \r\n    - `ImGuiListClipper(int items_count, float items_height)` --> Use `ImGuiListClipper() + clipper.Begin()`.\r\n- Clipper: Renamed `ForceDisplayRangeByIndices()` to `IncludeRangeByIndices()`, kept inline redirection function (introduced in 1.86 and rarely used). (#6424, #3841)\r\n- Commented out obsolete/redirecting functions that were marked obsolete more than two years ago:\r\n   - `ListBoxHeader()` -> use `BeginListBox()`\r\n   - `ListBoxFooter()` -> use `EndListBox()`\r\n   - Note how two variants of `ListBoxHeader()` existed. Check commented versions in imgui.h for refeence.\r\n- Backends: SDL_Renderer: Renamed 'imgui_impl_sdlrenderer.h/cpp' to 'imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2.h/cpp',\r\n  in order to accomodate for upcoming SDL3 and change in its SDL_Renderer API. (#6286)\r\n- Backends: GLUT: Removed call to `ImGui::NewFrame()` from `ImGui_ImplGLUT_NewFrame()`. It needs to be called from the main app loop, like with every other backends. (#6337) [@GereonV]\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\n\r\n- Window: Fixed resizing from upper border when `io.ConfigWindowsMoveFromTitleBarOnly` is set. (#6390)\r\n- Tables: Fixed a small miscalculation in `TableHeader()` leading to an empty tooltip showing when a sorting column has no visible name. (#6342) [@lukaasm]\r\n- Tables: Fixed command merging when compiling with VS2013 (one array on stack was not initialized on VS2013. Unsure if due to a bug or UB/standard conformance). (#6377)\r\n- InputText: Avoid setting `io.WantTextInputNextFrame` during the deactivation frame. (#6341) [@lukaasm]\r\n- Drag, Sliders: if the format string doesn't contain any `%`, CTRL+Click to input text will use the default format specifier for the type. Allow display/input of raw value when using \"enums\" patterns (display label instead of value) + allow using when value is hidden. (#6405)\r\n- Nav: Record/restore preferred position on each given axis after a movement on that axis, then score movement on the other axis using this as a bias. This allows going up and down between e.g. a large header spanning horizontal space and three-ways-columns, landing on the same column as before.\r\n- Nav: Fixed navigation within tables/columns where item boundaries goes beyond columns limits, unclipped bounding boxes would interfere with other columns. (#2221) [@zzzyap, @ocornut]\r\n- Nav: Fixed CTRL+Tab into a root window with only childs with `_NavFlattened` flags erroneously initializing default nav layer to menu layer.\r\n- Menus: Fixed an issue when opening a menu hierarchy in a given menu-bar would allow opening another via simple hovering. (#3496, #4797)\r\n- Fonts: Fixed crash when merging fonts and the first font has no valid glyph. (#6446) [@JaedanC]\r\n- Fonts: Fixed crash when manually specifying an EllipsisChar that doesn't exist. (#6480)\r\n- Misc: Added `ImVec2` unary minus operator. (#6368) [@Koostosh]\r\n- Debug Tools: Debug Log: Fixed not parsing 0xXXXXXXXX values for geo-locating on mouse hover hover when the identifier is at the end of the line. (#5855)\r\n- Debug Tools: Added `io.ConfigDebugIgnoreFocusLoss` option to disable `io.AddFocusEvent(false)` handling. May facilitate interactions with a debugger when focus loss leads to clearing inputs data. (#4388, #4921)\r\n- Backends: Clear bits sets `io.BackendFlags` on backend `Shutdown()`. (#6334, #6335] [@GereonV]\r\n  Potentially this would facilitate switching runtime backend mid-session.\r\n- Backends: Win32: `Added ImGui_ImplWin32_InitForOpenGL()` to facilitate combining raw Win32/Winapi with OpenGL. (#3218)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Restore front and back polygon mode separately when supported by context (Desktop 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2+ with compat bit). (#6333) [@GereonV]\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Support for `glBindSampler()` backup/restore on ES3. (#6375) [@jsm174]\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Fixed build on Emscripten/iOS/Android. (#6391) [@jo-codegirl]\r\n- Backends: SDLRenderer3: Added SDL_Renderer for SDL3 backend. (#6286) [@Carcons, @ocornut]\r\n- Examples: Added native Win32+OpenGL3 example. We don't recommend using this setup but we provide it for completeness. (#3218, #5170, #6086, #2772, #2600, #2359, #2022, #1553) [@learn-more]\r\n- Examples: Vulkan: Use integrated GPU if nothing else is available. (#6359) [@kimidaisuki22]\r\n- Examples: DX9, DX10, DX11: Queue framebuffer resize instead of processing in WM_SIZE, as some drivers tends to only cleanup after existing the native resize modal loop. (#6374)\r\n- Examples: Added SDL3+SDL_Renderer example. (#6286)\r\n- Examples: Updated all Visual Studio projects and batches to use /utf-8 argument.\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.89.5 to 1.89.6 related to the docking branch (multi-viewport and docking features) include:\r\n\r\n- Viewports: Fixed platform-side focus (e.g. Alt+Tab) from leading to accidental closure of Modal windows. Regression from 1.89.5. (#6357, #6299)\r\n- Viewports: Fixed erroneous popup closure on closing a previous popup. (#6462, #6299)\r\n- Viewports: Fixed loss of imgui-side focus when dragging a secondary viewport back in main viewport, due to platform-side handling changes. Regression from 1.89.5 (#6299)\r\n- Viewports: Added `void* ImGuiPlatformMonitor::PlatformHandle` field (backend-dependant), for usage by user code.\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Preserve monitor list when there are no monitor, may briefly happen when recovering from macOS sleeping mode. (#5683) [@Guistac]\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Update monitor list when receiving a display event. (#6348) Note however that SDL2 currently doesn't have an event for a DPI/Scaling change, so monitor data won't be updated in this situation.\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Update monitor list when receiving a display event. (#6348)\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.89.5 to 1.89.6 related to the range-select branch: (aimed to finish, apply some api changes and merge in 1.90):\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: (BREAKING) Renamed `ImGuiMultiSelectData` to `ImGuiMultiSelectIO`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Made `SetNextItemSelectionData()` optional to allow disjoint selection (e.g. with a CollapsingHeader between items).\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Enter can alter selection if current item is not selected.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Removed DragDropActive/preserve_existing_selection logic which seems unused + comments.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Demo tweak. Removed multi-scope from Advanced (too messy), made it a separate mini-demo\r\n\r\n## New exciting projects!\r\n\r\nSince 1.89 we semi-sneakily soft launched two new entire projects!\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui Automation/Test Engine & Test Suite**\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine\r\n\r\n**Dear Bindings: alternative binding generator for C and other languages** by @ShironekoBen (as an alternative to good old [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)).\r\nhttps://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\nBelow a selection of screenshots from [Gallery threads](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/6478)...\r\n\r\n@DickyQi\r\n_\"**MediaEditor Community (MEC)** is a highly integrated and easy to learn application software that can be used to create, edit, and produce high-quality videos.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nAll Changes:\r\n\r\n- InputText: Reworked prev/next-word behavior to more closely match Visual Studio text editor. Include '.' as a delimiter and alter varying subtle behavior with how blanks and separators are treated when skipping words. (#6067) [@ajweeks]\r\n- InputText: Fixed a tricky edge case, ensuring value is always written back on the frame where `IsItemDeactivated()` returns true, in order to allow usage without user retaining underlying data. While we don't really want to encourage user not retaining underlying data, in the absence of a \"late commit\" behavior/flag we understand it may be desirable to take advantage of this trick. (#4714)\r\n- Drag, Sliders: Fixed parsing of text input when '+' or '#' format flags are used in the format string. (#6259) [@idbrii]\r\n- Nav: Made Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab windowing register ownership to held modifier so it doesn't interfere with other code when remapping those actions. (#4828, #3255, #5641)\r\n- Nav: Made PageUp/PageDown/Home/End navigation also scroll parent windows when necessary to make the target location fully visible (same as e.g. arrow keys).\r\n- ColorEdit: Fixed shading of S/V triangle in Hue Wheel mode. (#5200, #6254) [@jamesthomasgriffin]\r\n- TabBar: Tab-bars with `ImGuiTabBarFlags_FittingPolicyScroll` can be scrolled with horizontal mouse-wheel (or Shift + WheelY). (#2702)\r\n- Rendering: Using adaptive tessellation for RadioButton, ColorEdit preview circles, Windows Close and Collapse Buttons.\r\n- ButtonBehavior: Fixed an edge case where changing widget type/behavior while active and using same id could lead to an assert. (#6304)\r\n- Misc: Fixed ImVec2 operator[] violating aliasing rules causing issue with Intel C++ compiler. (#6272) [@BayesBug]\r\n- IO: Input queue trickling adjustment for touch screens. Fixes single-tapping to move simulated mouse and immediately click on a widget that is using the `ImGuiButtonFlags_AllowItemOverlap` policy.  (#2702, #4921)\r\n  - This only works if the backend can distinguish TouchScreen vs Mouse. See 'Demo->Tools->Metrics->Inputs->Mouse Source' to verify.\r\n  - Fixed tapping on `BeginTabItem()` on a touch-screen. (#2702)\r\n  - Fixed tapping on `CollapsingHeader()` with a close button on a touch-screen.\r\n  - Fixed tapping on `TreeNode()` using `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap` on a touch-screen.\r\n  - Fixed tapping on `Selectable()` using `ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowItemOverlap` on a touch-screen.\r\n  - Fixed tapping on `TableHeader()` on a touch-screen.\r\n- IO: Added `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` and `ImGuiMouseSource` enum. This is to allow backend to specify actual event source between Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen. (#2702, #2334, #2372, #3453, #5693)\r\n- IO: Fixed support for calling `io.AddXXXX` functions from inactive context (wrongly advertised as supported in 1.89.4). (#6199, #6256, #5856) [@cfillion]\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed GL loader crash when GL_VERSION returns NULL. (#6154, #4445, #3530)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Properly restoring \"no shader program bound\" if it was the case prior to running the rendering function. (#6267, #6220, #6224) [@BrunoLevy]\r\n- Backends: Win32: Added support for `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen. (#2334, #2702)\r\n- Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Added support for `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen. This is relying on SDL passing `SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID` in the event's 'which' field. (#2334, #2702)\r\n- Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Avoid calling `SDL_StartTextInput()`/`SDL_StopTextInput()` as they actually block text input input and don't only pertain to IME. It's unclear exactly what their relation is to other IME function such as `SDL_SetTextInputRect()`. (#6306, #6071, #1953)\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Added support on Win32 only for `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen. (#2334, #2702)\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed key modifiers handling on secondary viewports. (#6248, #6034) [@aiekick]\r\n- Backends: Android: Added support for `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` to discriminate Mouse/TouchScreen/Pen. (#6315) [@PathogenDavid]\r\n- Backends: OSX: Added support for `io.AddMouseSourceEvent()` to discriminate Mouse/Pen. (#6314) [@PathogenDavid]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Align buffers. Use WGSL shaders instead of SPIR-V. Add gamma uniform. (#6188) [@eliemichel]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Reorganized to store data in `io.BackendRendererUserData` like other backends.\r\n- Examples: Vulkan: Fixed validation errors with newer VulkanSDK by explicitly querying and enabling  \"VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2\", \"VK_KHR_portability_enumeration\", and\r\n  VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR. (#6109, #6172, #6101)\r\n- Examples: Windows: Added `misc/debuggers/imgui.natstepfilter` file to all Visual Studio projects, now that VS 2022 17.6 Preview 2 support adding Debug Step Filter spec files into projects.\r\n- Examples: SDL3: Updated for latest WIP SDL3 branch. (#6243)\r\n- TestSuite: Added variety of new regression tests and improved/amended existing ones\r\n  in [imgui_test_engine/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine) repository. [@PathogenDavid, @ocornut]\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.89.4 to 1.89.5 related to the docking branch (multi-viewport and docking features) include:\r\n\r\n- Viewports: Setting focus from Platform/OS (e.g. via decoration, or Alt-Tab) sets corresponding focus at Dear ImGui level (generally last focused window in the viewport). (#6299)\r\n- Docking: Fixed using `GetItemXXX()` or `IsItemXXX()` functions after a `DockSpace()` call. (#6217)\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed key modifiers handling on secondary viewports. (#6248, #6034) [@aiekick]\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Fixed Emscripten erroneously enabling multi-viewport support, leading to assert. (#5683)\r\n- Backends: SDL2/SDL3: Fixed IME text input rectangle position with viewports. (#6071, #1953)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Fixed for compilation with multi-viewports. (#6255) [@P3RK4N]\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.89.4 to 1.89.5 related to the range-select branch: (aimed to finish, apply some api changes and merge in 1.90):\r\n\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Fixed 'Enter' to never alter selection (unlike Space).\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Fixed needing to set RangeSrcPassedBy when not using clipper.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnClickWindowVoid`.\r\n- RangeSelect/MultiSelect: Added `ImGuiMultiSelectFlags_ClearOnEscape`.\r\n\r\n## New exciting projects!\r\n\r\nSince 1.89 we semi-sneakily soft launched two new entire projects!\r\n\r\n**Dear ImGui Automation/Test Engine & Test Suite**\r\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine\r\n\r\n**Dear Bindings: alternative binding generator for C and other languages** by @ShironekoBen \r\nhttps://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n\r\nBelow a selection of screenshots from [Gallery threads](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/5886)...\r\n\r\n**thpp** by @Rodan:\r\nhttps://github.com/rodan/thpp\r\n_\"I wanted to try out Dear ImGui, so I wrote a thermal image processing software around it.

See [Sponsors page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Sponsors) for details.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\n- Nav: Tab key goes through every items (when keyboard navigation is active).\r\n- Nav: Enter key works to activate most items (when keyboard navigation is active).\r\n- Added return value to BeginTooltip().\r\n- Examples: Activated keyboard and gamepad navigation by default in all examples.\r\n- Various other fixes related to: Nav, Tables, Drag and Drop, InputText.\r\n- Various improvements to Win32, SDL2, SDL3, GLFW backends. \r\n- Added a Debug Tools to facilitate testing user-code testing Begin/BeginChild return value.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to [v1.89](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89), [v1.89.1](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.1), [v1.89.2](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.2) and [v1.89.3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.89.3). **We are trying to make more frequent releases.** Because: some people are relying on tagging and auto-generated bindings for other languages. And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Renamed `PushAllowKeyboardFocus()`/`PopAllowKeyboardFocus()` to `PushTabStop()`/`PopTabStop()`. Kept inline redirection functions (will obsolete).\r\n- Moved the optional \"courtesy maths operators\" implementation from imgui_internal.h in imgui.h. Even though we encourage using your own maths types and operators by setting up `IM_VEC2_CLASS_EXTRA`, it has been frequently requested by people to use our own. We had an opt-in define which was **previously fulfilled by imgui_internal.h. It is now fulfilled by imgui.h**. (#6164, #6137, #5966, #2832)\r\n   - OK:     `#define IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS` / `#include \"imgui.h\"` / `#include \"imgui_internal.h\"`\r\n   - Error:  `#include \"imgui.h\"` / `#define IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS` / `#include \"imgui_internal.h\"`\r\n  - Added a dedicated compile-time check message to help diagnose this.\r\n- Tooltips: Added 'bool' return value to `BeginTooltip()` for API consistency. Please only submit contents and call EndTooltip() if BeginTooltip() returns true. In reality the function will _currently_ always return true, but further changes down the line may change this, best to clarify API sooner. Updated demo code accordingly.\r\n- Commented out redirecting enums/functions names that were marked obsolete two years ago:\r\n  - `ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampOnInput` -> use `ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp`\r\n  - `ImGuiInputTextFlags_AlwaysInsertMode` -> use `ImGuiInputTextFlags_AlwaysOverwrite`\r\n  - `ImDrawList::AddBezierCurve()` -> use `ImDrawList::AddBezierCubic()`\r\n  - `ImDrawList::PathBezierCurveTo()` -> use `ImDrawList::PathBezierCubicCurveTo()`\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\n\r\n- Nav: Tabbing now cycles through all items when `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard` is set. (#3092, #5759, #787)\r\n  While this was generally desired and requested by many, note that its addition means that some types of UI may become more fastidious to use TAB key with, if the navigation cursor cycles through too many items. You can mark items items as not tab-spottable:\r\n   - Public API: `PushTabStop(false)` / `PopTabStop()`.\r\n   - Internal: `PushItemFlag(ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop, true);`.\r\n   - Internal: Directly pass `ImGuiItemFlags_NoTabStop` to `ItemAdd()` for custom widgets.\r\n- Nav: Tabbing/Shift-Tabbing can more reliably be used to step out of an item that is not tab-stoppable. (#3092, #5759, #787)\r\n- Nav: Made Enter key submit the same type of Activation event as Space key, allowing to press buttons with Enter. (#5606)\r\n  (Enter emulates a \"prefer text input\" activation vs. Space emulates a \"prefer tweak\" activation which is to closer to gamepad controls).\r\n- Nav: Fixed an issue with Gamepad navigation when the movement lead to a scroll and frame time > repeat rate. Triggering a new move request on the same frame as a move result lead to an incorrect calculation and loss of navigation id. (#6171)\r\n- Nav: Fixed SetItemDefaultFocus() from not scrolling when item is partially visible. (#2814, #2812) [@DomGries]\r\n- Tables: Fixed an issue where user's Y cursor movement within a hidden column would have side-effects.\r\n- IO: Lifted constraint to call `io.AddEventXXX` functions from current context. (#4921, #5856, #6199)\r\n- InputText: Fixed not being able to use CTRL+Tab while an InputText() using Tab for completion or text data is active (regression from 1.89).\r\n- Drag and Drop: Fixed handling of overlapping targets when smaller one is submitted before and can accept the same data type. (#6183).\r\n- Drag and Drop: Clear drag and drop state as soon as delivery is accepted in order to avoid interferences. (#5817, #6183) [@DimaKoltun]\r\n- Debug Tools: Added `io.ConfigDebugBeginReturnValueOnce` / `io.ConfigDebugBeginReturnValueLoop` options to simulate Begin/BeginChild returning false to facilitate debugging user behavior.\r\n- Demo: Updated to test return value of `BeginTooltip()`.\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed restoration of a potentially deleted OpenGL program. If an active program was pending deletion, attempting to restore it would error. (#6220, #6224) [@Cyphall]\r\n- Backends: Win32: Use `WM_NCMOUSEMOVE` / `WM_NCMOUSELEAVE` to track mouse positions over non-client area (e.g. OS decorations) when app is not focused. (#6045, #6162)\r\n- Backends: SDL2, SDL3: Accept `SDL_GetPerformanceCounter()` not returning a monotonically increasing value. (#6189, #6114, #3644) [@adamkewley]\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Avoid using `glfwGetError()` and `glfwGetGamepadState()` on Emscripten, which recently updated its GLFW emulation layer to GLFW 3.3 without supporting those. (#6240)\r\n- Examples: Android: Fixed example build for Gradle 8. (#6229, #6227) [@duddel]\r\n- Examples: Updated all examples application to enable `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard` and `ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad` by default. (#787)\r\n- Internals: Misc tweaks to facilitate applying an explicit-context patch.

And: it sets a beat and may encourage teams to update more frequently.\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes:\r\n\r\n- Backends+Examples: SDL2: renamed all unnumbered references to \"sdl\" to \"sdl2\". This is in prevision for the future release of SDL3 and its associated backend. (#6146)\r\n  - `imgui_impl_sdl.cpp` -> `imgui_impl_sdl2.cpp`\r\n  - `imgui_impl_sdl.h`   -> `imgui_impl_sdl2.h`\r\n  - `example_sdl_xxxx/`  -> `example_sdl2_xxxx/` (folders and projects)\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\n\r\n- SeparatorText(): Added `SeparatorText()` widget. (#1643) [@phed, @ocornut]\r\n  - Added to style: `float SeparatorTextBorderSize`.\r\n  - Added to style: `ImVec2 SeparatorTextAlign`, `ImVec2 SeparatorTextPadding`.\r\n- Tables: Raised max Columns count from 64 to 512. The previous limit was due to using 64-bit integers but we moved to bits-array and tweaked the system enough to ensure no performance loss.  (#6094, #5305, #4876, #3572) \r\n- Tables: Solved an ID conflict issue with multiple-instances of a same table, due to how unique table instance id was generated. (#6140) [@ocornut, @rodrigorc]\r\n- Inputs, Scrolling: Made horizontal scroll wheel and horizontal scroll direction consistent across backends/os. (#4019, #6096, #1463) [@PathogenDavid, @ocornut, @rokups]\r\n  - Clarified that 'wheel_y > 0.0f' scrolls Up, 'wheel_y > 0.0f' scrolls Down.\r\n  - Clarified that 'wheel_x > 0.0f' scrolls Left, 'wheel_x > 0.0f' scrolls Right.\r\n  - Backends: Fixed horizontal scroll direction for Win32 and SDL backends. (#4019)\r\n  - Shift+WheelY support on non-OSX machines was already correct. (#2424, #1463) (whereas on OSX machines Shift+WheelY turns into WheelX at the OS level).\r\n  - If you use a custom backend, you should verify horizontal wheel direction.\r\n    - Axises are flipped by OSX for mouse & touch-pad when 'Natural Scrolling' is on.\r\n    - Axises are flipped by Windows for touch-pad when 'Settings->Touchpad->Down motion scrolls up' is on.\r\n    - You can use `Demo->Tools->Debug Log->IO` to visualize values submitted to Dear ImGui.\r\n  - Known issues remaining with Emscripten:\r\n    - The magnitude of wheeling values on Emscripten was improved but isn't perfect. (#6096)\r\n    - When running the Emscripten app on a Mac with a mouse, SHIFT+WheelY doesn't turn into WheelX. This is because we don't know that we are running on Mac and apply our own Shift+swapping on top of OSX' own swapping, so wheel axises are swapped twice. Emscripten apps may need to find a way to detect this and set `io.ConfigMacOSXBehaviors` manually (if you know a way let us know!), or offer the \"OSX-style behavior\" option to their user.\r\n- Window: Avoid rendering shapes for hidden resize grips.\r\n- Text: Fixed layouting of wrapped-text block skipping successive empty lines, regression from the fix in 1.89.2. (#5720, #5919)\r\n- Text: Fixed clipping of single-character \"...\" ellipsis (U+2026 or U+0085) when font is scaled. Scaling wasn't taken into account, leading to ellipsis character straying slightly out of its expected boundaries. (#2775)\r\n- Text: Tweaked rendering of three-dots \"...\" ellipsis variant. (#2775, #4269)\r\n- InputText: Added support for Ctrl+Delete to delete up to end-of-word. (Not adding Super+Delete to delete to up to end-of-line on OSX, as OSX doesn't have it) (#6067) [@ajweeks] \r\n- InputText: On OSX, inhibit usage of Alt key to toggle menu when active (used for work skip).\r\n- Menus: Fixed layout of `MenuItem()`/`BeginMenu()` when label contains a '\\n'. (#6116) [@imkcy9]\r\n- ColorEdit, ColorPicker: Fixed hue/saturation preservation logic from interfering with the displayed value (but not stored value) of others widgets instances. (#6155)\r\n- PlotHistogram, PlotLines: Passing negative sizes honor alignment like other widgets.\r\n- Combo: Allow `SetNextWindowSize()` to alter combo popup size. (#6130)\r\n- Fonts: Assert that in each `GlyphRanges[]` pairs first is <= second.\r\n- ImDrawList: Added missing early-out in `AddPolyline()` and `AddConvexPolyFilled()` when color alpha is zero.\r\n- Misc: Most text functions treat `\"%s\"` as a shortcut to no-formatting. (#3466)\r\n- Misc: Tolerate zero delta-time under Emscripten as backends are imprecise in their values for `io.DeltaTime`, and browser features such as `privacy.resistFingerprinting=true` can exacerbate that. (#6114, #3644)\r\n- Backends: OSX: Fixed scroll/wheel scaling for devices emitting events with `hasPreciseScrollingDeltas==false` (e.g. non-Apple mices).\r\n- Backends: Win32: flipping `WM_MOUSEHWHEEL` horizontal value to match other backends and offer consistent horizontal scrolling direction. (#4019)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: flipping `SDL_MOUSEWHEEL` horizontal value to match other backends and offer consistent horizontal scrolling direction. (#4019)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Removed `SDL_MOUSEWHEEL` value clamping. (#4019, #6096, #6081)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Added support for SDL 2.0.18+ `preciseX`/`preciseY` mouse wheel data for smooth scrolling as reported by SDL. (#4019, #6096)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Avoid calling `SDL_SetCursor()` when cursor has not changed, as the function is surprisingly costly on Mac with latest SDL (already fixed in SDL latest trunk). (#6113)\r\n- Backends: SDL2: Implement IME handler to call `SDL_SetTextInputRect()`/`SDL_StartTextInput()`. It will only works with SDL 2.0.18+ if your code calls 'SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_IME_SHOW_UI, \"1\")' prior to calling `SDL_CreateWindow()`. Updated all examples accordingly. (#6071, #1953)\r\n- Backends: SDL3: Added experimental `imgui_impl_sdl3.cpp` backend. SDL 3.0.0 has not yet been released, so it is possible that its specs/api will change before release. This backend is provided as a convenience for early adopters etc. We don't recommend\r\n  switching to SDL3 before it is released. (#6146) [@dovker, @ocornut] \r\n- Backends: GLFW: Registering custom low-level mouse wheel handler to get more accurate scrolling impulses on Emscripten. (#4019, #6096) [@ocornut, @wolfpld, @tolopolarity]\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Added `ImGui_ImplGlfw_SetCallbacksChainForAllWindows()` to instruct backend to chain callbacks even for secondary viewports/windows. User callbacks may need to test the 'window' parameter. (#6142)\r\n- Backends: OpenGL3: Fixed GL loader compatibility with 2.x profiles. (#6154, #4445, #3530) [@grauw]\r\n- Backends: WebGPU: Fixed building for latest WebGPU specs (remove implicit layout generation). (#6117, #4116, #3632) [@tonygrue, @bfierz]\r\n- Examples: refactored SDL2+GL and GLFW+GL examples to compile with Emscripten. (#2492, #2494, #3699, #3705) [@ocornut, @nicolasnoble] The dedicated example_emscripten_opengl3/ has been removed.\r\n- Examples: Added SDL3+GL experimental example. (#6146)\r\n- Examples: Win32: Fixed examples using `RegisterClassW()` since 1.89 to also call `DefWindowProcW()` instead of `DefWindowProc()` so that title text are correctly converted when application is compiled without `/DUNICODE`. (#5725, #5961, #5975) [@markreidvfx]\r\n- Examples: SDL2+SDL_Renderer: Added call to `SDL_RenderSetScale()` to fix display on a Retina display (albeit lower-res as our other unmodified examples). (#6121, #6065, #5931).\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.89.2 to 1.89.3 related to the **docking** branch (multi-viewport and docking features) include:\r\n\r\n- Backends: GLFW: Handle unsupported glfwGetVideoMode() for Emscripten.
