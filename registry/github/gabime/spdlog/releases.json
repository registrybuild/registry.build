Users can now to include only the actual sinks/features they need from ```spdlog/sinks``` folder. \r\n\r\n* Upgrade  to **fmt lib version 5.1** - thanks @vitaut for this great lib.\r\n\r\n* **Support for custom formatting per sink** - each sink can have it's own formatting and level  using ```sink->set_pattern(..)``` or ```sink->set_formatter(..)```.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **async logging - thread pool** - async loggers now share a global thread pool by default. \r\nCreating and destroying async loggers is cheap now. This is in contrast to previous versions were creating async loggers was expensive, since each logger instance had its own worker thread and queue. \r\nThe global thread pool and can be configured using ```spdlog::init_thread_pool(queue_size, worker_threads)``` or created directly using make_shared.  \r\n\r\n* **periodic flusher**: ```spdlog::flush_every(seconds)``` to periodically flush all registered loggers.\r\n\r\n* Improved performance - by caching some recently used values in the pattern formatter.\r\n\r\n*  Ability to add sinks to a logger after its creation (but it is not thread safe to do so - so use with caution). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* Include what you need. For example to use basic_logger add  ``` #include \"spdlog/sinks/basic_file_sink.h\"``` (see example in readme).\r\n\r\n* To use async loggers - include ```\"spdlog/async.h\"```\r\n\r\n* Replaced ```set_async_mode(..)``` with factory template. For example:\r\n```c++\r\n auto logger= spdlog::rotating_logger_mt<spdlog::async_factory>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Removed ```printf``` support.\r\n\r\n* Removed warmup/teardown functions from async.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Custom sinks inheriting from ```sinks::base_sink``` need to format (if needed) the message before sending to their target. For example\r\n```c++\r\nvoid sink_it_(const details::log_msg &msg) override\r\n{\r\n  fmt::memory_buffer formatted;\r\n  sink::formatter_->format(msg, formatted);\r\n  // sink the formatted\r\n  ...   \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Added ```clone()``` virtual function to the formatter interface.\r\n\r\n* Removed support for ```#define SPDLOG_NO_REGISTRY_MUTEX```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change log\r\nSee  [here](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/compare/v0.17.0...v1.x) the complete list of changes.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}]
