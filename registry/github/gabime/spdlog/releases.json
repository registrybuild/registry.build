Even if a log macro evaluate to a log call, the macro will check at runtime the level before evaluating its arguments.\r\n So for example the following won't evaluate `some_costly_function()` because the logger's level is error:\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #define SPDLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL SPDLOG_LEVEL_DEBUG\r\n  #include \"spdlog/spdlog.h\"\r\n   ..\r\n   spdlog::set_level(error);\r\n   SPDLOG_DEBUG(\"Some costly arg: {}\", some_costly_function());\r\n  ```\r\n* CMake improvements.
