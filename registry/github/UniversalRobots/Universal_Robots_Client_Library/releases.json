is a major release of the client library. That means that there are a couple of API-breaking changes in the library. See the [migration notes](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/blob/master/doc/migration_notes.rst#migrating-from-1xx-to-2xx) for details. Most changes should not affect users.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* Fix naming issues by @urfeex in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/307\r\n  - In the ``urcl::ExampleRobotWrapper`` class the ``ur_driver_``, ``dashboard_client`` and\r\n    ``primary_client`` members are now private. Use ``getUrDriver()``, ``getDashboardClient()`` and\r\n    ``getPrimaryClient()`` to access them.\r\n  - In ``urcl::comm::ControlModeTypes`` two member functions have been renamed:\r\n    - ``is_control_mode_realtime`` -> ``isControlModeRealtime``\r\n    - ``is_control_mode_non_realtime`` -> ``isControlModeNonRealtime``\r\n  - In ``urcl::RobotReceiveTimeout`` the ``timeout_`` member is now private. Use\r\n    ``getAsMilliseconds()`` to access it.\r\n  - In ``urcl::UrDriverConfiguration`` two members have been renamed:\r\n    - ``rtde_initialization_attempts_`` -> ``rtde_initialization_attempts``\r\n    - ``rtde_initialization_timeout_`` -> ``rtde_initialization_timeout``\r\n* #303 updated the communication protocol on the trajectory point interface. If you have been implementing a custom client for that protocol or you have a custom URScript implementing the protocol, please look at the [updated documentation](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/blob/master/doc/architecture/trajectory_point_interface.rst#communication-protocol).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n* [start_ursim.sh] Always download and install the latest URCap(X) if not present by @urfeex in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/301\r\n* Add functionality to send MoveP and MoveC instructions to the robot by @urfeex in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/303\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n* [start_ursim.sh] Use direct web pages instead of GitHub API by @urfeex in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/308\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* Document robot setup for PolyScope X by @urfeex in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/302\r\n* Fix typo in freedrive example document by @xndcn in https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/pull/304\r\n\r\n## CI / repo / package\r\n* Polyscope x integration tests by @urfeex in
