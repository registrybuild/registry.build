Note that this uses the key generation seed (32\r\n    bytes) to represent private keys, rather than the serialization as defined\r\n    by the \"skEncode\" function in FIPS 204.\r\n*   Added SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s to Tink, according to the standard described at\r\n    https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final.\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n*   Removed rapidjson dependency.\r\n*   Use C++17 as minimum C++ version.\r\n*   Upgraded protobuf to 29.3.\r\n*   Upgraded rules_cc to 0.1.1\r\n*   Upgraded rules_proto to 7.1.0\r\n*   Upgraded platforms to 0.0.11\r\n*   Upgraded googletest to 1.16.0\r\n*   Upgraded boringssl to 0.20250415.0\r\n*   Upgraded abseil-cpp to 20250127.1\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   Make the `Key` class cloneable. Note that each subclass will now have to\r\n    implement the `Clone()` method.\r\n*   Make the `Parameters` class cloneable. Note that each subclass will have to\r\n    implement the `Clone()` method.\r\n*   Use proto library to parse JSON serialized keysets, instead of rapidjson.\r\n    All valid JSON-encoded keysets are still parsed the same way, but there are\r\n    some invalid keysets that may now fail to parse with a different error.\r\n*   Removed subtle::WycheproofUtil. Its functions use rapidjson objects as input\r\n    or output parameters and can't be supported anymore. Users of these\r\n    functions should copy WycheproofUtil into their own codebase.\r\n*   Removed subtle::X25519 and related functions. To the best of our knowledge,\r\n    there are no users of this struct and the related functions. In addition, it\r\n    is untested. If you need this, please file an issue.\r\n*   Added `SecretData` accessor method for `RestrictedBigInteger`.\r\n*   Most of the Key classes are now final. These cannot be subclassed as this\r\n    would break `operator==`.\r\n*   Moved `crypto::tink::util::SecretData` to `crypto:tink` in\r\n    `tink/secret_data.h` and make `crypto::tink::util::SecretData` a deprecated\r\n    alias of `crypto::tink::SecretData`.\r\n*   Moved away from the absl-internal `absl::big_endian::Load32` and\r\n    `absl::big_endian::Store32`. This is needed for Tink to work with future\r\n    versions of absl."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/186311514","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/186311514/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/186311514/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/tag/v2.3.0","id":186311514,"author":{"login":"cindylindeed","id":9029396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjkzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9029396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed","html_url":"https://github.com/cindylindeed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOHXj_qc4LGuNa","tag_name":"v2.3.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"v2.3.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-11-19T05:44:37Z","published_at":"2024-11-20T01:24:25Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/assets/207713001","id":207713001,"node_id":"RA_kwDOHXj_qc4MYXLp","name":"tink-cc-2.3.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"cindylindeed","id":9029396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjkzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9029396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed","html_url":"https://github.com/cindylindeed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cindylindeed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":2868915,"digest":null,"download_count":6652,"created_at":"2024-11-20T01:23:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T01:23:03Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc/releases/download/v2.3.0/tink-cc-2.3.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/tarball/v2.3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tink-crypto/tink-cc/zipball/v2.3.0","body":"#

This method was never intended to be public and there is no reason\r\n    to assume anyone uses it.\r\n\r\n*   Enabled building against pre-installed protobuf with CMake.\r\n*   Moved Bazel test-only deps to `tink_cc_testonly_deps()`.\r\n*   Dependency upgrades:\r\n    *   protobuf (=> 26.1)\r\n    *   googletest (=> 1.14)\r\n    *   absl (=> 20230802.1)\r\n    *   BoringSSL (=> 07fa2780386fbbc001937fabf116c1fe4ddd2705)\r\n    *   bazel_skylib (=> 1.5.0)\r\n    *   Bazel (=> 6.4.0)\r\n*   Added class to represent elliptic curve points.\r\n*   Added `SecretDataEquals`. `SecretData::operator==` is currently not\r\n    constant time, and should not be called by users. Tink 3.0 will change\r\n    this, but in the mean time, it should not be called and SecretDataEquals\r\n    should be used instead.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nTo see what we're working towards, check
