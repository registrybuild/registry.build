subset of the C99 and C++98 languages. The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate OPC UA-based communication into existing applications.

The plugins, as well as the server and client examples are in the public domain (CC0 license). They can be reused under any license and changes do not have to be published.\r\n\r\nNew features compared to the previous release series 1.2 include:\r\n\r\n- Support for OPC UA PubSub encryption (also TPM-based key handling)\r\n- Session authentication with x509 certificates (server-side)\r\n- Support for Event Filters\r\n- Support for Server Diagnostics\r\n- Binary/JSON encoding as a stable public API\r\n- Handling of Subscriptions with different priority\r\n- Greatly improved Nodeset Compiler, including support for structure values\r\n- Added UA_order function for all data types (equality test / absolute ordering for binary search trees, etc.)\r\n- Support for TLS-encrypted MQTT-based PubSub\r\n- Internally generate temporary self-signed certificates\r\n\r\nBesides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release. Particularly, the memory consumption of the information model was reduced by about 1/3 compared to the 1.2 release series.\r\n\r\nNote that the v1.3 release family contains new features compared to v1.0. These have not been part of the certification that was achieved for the example server based on the v1.0

is the fourth patch release for the 1.3 release family of open62541.\r\nThere were only bugfixes and no API-breaking changes applied for the patch release.\r\nNotables changes in this patch release are:\r\n\r\n- fix(plugin): Fix removal of AllowAll cert validation for OpenSSL\r\n- feat(plugin): Add OpenSSL 3.0 support (#5349)\r\n- fix(plugin): Disable padding by OpenSSL (is done internally)\r\n- fix(plugin): Reject all certificates for empty trust-list\r\n- fix(plugin): Fix warning for use of OPENSSL_API_COMPAT\r\n- feat(plugin): Add OpenSSL 3.0 support (#5349)\r\n- fix(plugin): Fix crash in OpenSSL when loaded with an empty certificate\r\n- fix(pubsub): Set correct block counter for aes-ctr encryption\r\n- fix(client): Wrong callback in UA_Client_Subscriptions_processPublishResponse\r\n- fix(core): DataValue statuscodes checks ignore additional information bits (#5375)\r\n- fix(plugin): Correctly update connection timeout statistics (#5344)\r\n- fix(core): Use of compound volatile operations (deprecated in C++20)\r\n\r\nopen62541 (http://open62541.org/) is an open source and free implementation of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) written in the common subset of the C99 and C++98 languages. The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate OPC UA-based communication into existing applications. The open62541 library is platform independent. All platform-specific functionality is implemented via exchangeable plugins. Plugin implementations are provided for the major operating systems.\r\n\r\nopen62541 is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPLv2). This allows the open62541 library to be combined and distributed as part of proprietary software. Only changes to the files of the open62541 library itself need to be licensed under the MPLv2 when copied and distributed. The plugins, as well as the server and client examples are in the public domain (CC0 license). They can be reused under any license and changes do not have to be published.\r\n\r\nNew features compared to the previous release series 1.2 include:\r\n\r\n- Support for OPC UA PubSub encryption (also TPM-based key handling)\r\n- Session authentication with x509 certificates (server-side)\r\n- Support for Event Filters\r\n- Support for Server Diagnostics\r\n- Binary/JSON encoding as a stable public API\r\n- Handling of Subscriptions with different priority\r\n- Greatly improved Nodeset Compiler, including support for structure values\r\n- Added UA_order function for all data types (equality test / absolute ordering for binary search trees, etc.)\r\n- Support for TLS-encrypted MQTT-based PubSub\r\n- Internally generate temporary self-signed certificates\r\n\r\nBesides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release. Particularly, the memory consumption of the information model was reduced by about 1/3 compared to the 1.2 release series.\r\n\r\nNote that the v1.3 release family contains new features compared to v1.0. These have not been part of the certification that was achieved for the example server based on the v1.0 release.\r\n\r\nopen62541 (http://open62541.org/) is an open source and free implementation of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) written in the common subset of the C99 and C++98 languages.
