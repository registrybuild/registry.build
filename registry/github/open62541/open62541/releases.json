The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate OPC UA-based communication into existing applications.

The plugins, as well as the server and client examples are in the public domain (CC0 license). They can be reused under any license and changes do not have to be published.\r\n\r\nNew features compared to the previous release series 1.2 include:\r\n\r\n- Support for OPC UA PubSub encryption (also TPM-based key handling)\r\n- Session authentication with x509 certificates (server-side)\r\n- Support for Event Filters\r\n- Support for Server Diagnostics\r\n- Binary/JSON encoding as a stable public API\r\n- Handling of Subscriptions with different priority\r\n- Greatly improved Nodeset Compiler, including support for structure values\r\n- Added UA_order function for all data types (equality test / absolute ordering for binary search trees, etc.)\r\n- Support for TLS-encrypted MQTT-based PubSub\r\n- Internally generate temporary self-signed certificates\r\n\r\nBesides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release.
