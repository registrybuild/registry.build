to the first major release of rules_ts since 1.0.0.\r\nWe'll update these release notes periodically as we get feedback from users.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\nWe now support Protocol Buffers and gRPC. See https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/blob/main/docs/proto.md\r\n\r\nWe no longer default to a Persistent Worker mode to make the developer round-trip fast, as this was buggy and we don't have the resources to maintain a custom TypeScript compiler wrapper. Instead, we recommend using a faster transpiler. The upgrade flow will print some error messages on the first run to help you migrate.\r\n\r\nWe now check for rules_ts updates as part of running `rules_ts_dependencies`, see https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/blob/main/docs/repositories.md#rules_ts_dependencies-check_for_updates. You can opt-out of the data collection by setting this attribute to `False`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- We now support only Bazel 6.0 or greater, since we rely on [validation actions](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/extending/rules#validation_actions)\r\n- We require that you select a value for the `skipLibCheck` flag, as there is no good default - you can either be fast or correct. Instructions are printed to the terminal on the first build.\r\n- We require that you select a value for the `transpiler` attribute. Again, there is no good default since the choices are to be fast or compatible. Documentation is at https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/blob/main/docs/transpiler.md\r\n- \"Persistent Worker\" mode is no longer enabled by default. It requires a custom `tsc` compiler program, and we don't have the resources or funding to deal with the [bugs this brings](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#non-deterministic-behavior). We think that choosing a faster transpiler is a better solution. If your organization would like support for worker mode, you can fund the maintenance work. Or, if you'd like to take over the persistent worker Node.js program, we are open to relocating the code to a separate repository.\r\n- The `supports_workers` attribute on `ts_project` is now a tri-state `[-1, 0, 1]` rather than a boolean.\r\n- `--define=VERBOSE_LOGS` no longer has an effect, use the `--@aspect_rules_ts//ts:verbose=true` flag instead\r\n- Replace usage of `load(\"@aspect_rules_ts//ts:repositories.bzl\", \"LATEST_VERSION\")` with `LATEST_TYPESCRIPT_VERSION`\r\n- The `ts_project` macro now produces a `ts_project` rule. Any bazel query expressions, aspect implementations, or other \"leaky abstractions\" that keyed on the kind of the underlying rule being \"ts_project_rule\" will need to be updated to the new name \"ts_project\".\r\n- json inputs that are not sources and do not have an input / output collision are now declared\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using [Bzlmod] with Bazel 6:\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_ts\", version = \"2.0.0\")\r\n\r\nrules_ts_ext = use_extension(\r\n    \"@aspect_rules_ts//ts:extensions.bzl\",\r\n    \"ext\",\r\n

this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"aspect_rules_ts\",\r\n
