BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️\r\n\r\nThe `rollup_bundle` rule is renamed to just `rollup`. This has been planned for a while to do before 1.0 and included in this release to go along with other breaking changes. `rollup_repositories` repository rule is removed and a new `node_modules` attribute is now required for `rollup`. This changes are BREAKING for all users.\r\n\r\nThe `//path/to:node_modules` tree target must be passed to the `rollup` rule via the `node_modules` attribute. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nrollup(\r\n    name = \"bundle\",\r\n    node_modules = \"//:node_modules\",\r\n    ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need `rollup` linked in the node_modules tree provided.\r\n\r\nThis change has the added benefits of not requiring users to keep the terser version used in their `package.json` in sync with their WORKSPACE and not requiring any changes to `rules_rollup` to support new releases of rollup.\r\n\r\nThis change is in the spirit of the changes in rules_webpack [v0.11.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_webpack/releases/tag/v0.11.0), rules_jasmine [v0.4.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jasmine/releases) and rules_terser [v0.14.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_terser/releases/tag/v0.14.0) and will also be rolled out to rules_jest in the near future so the patterns on the downstream rules_js rulesets we maintain are aligned both for maintainers and for users.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE
