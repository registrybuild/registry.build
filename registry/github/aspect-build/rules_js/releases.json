= \"2.7.0\")\n\n####### Node.js version #########\n# By default you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\n# Optionally you can pin a different node version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version =

Allows developers to use the matching pnpm version, for example:\n# bazel run -- @pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\n```\n\n## Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste

companies are successfully building with rules_js.\nIf you're getting value from the project, please let us know!\nJust comment on our [Adoption Discussion](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/discussions/1000).\n\n## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n```starlark\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_js\", version = \"2.6.2\")\n\n####### Node.js version #########\n# By default you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\n# Optionally you can pin a different node version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"18.14.2\")\n#################################\n\nnpm = use_extension(\"@aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"npm\", dev_dependency = True)\n\nnpm.npm_translate_lock(\n    name = \"npm\",\n    pnpm_lock = \"//:pnpm-lock.yaml\",\n    verify_node_modules_ignored = \"//:.bazelignore\",\n)\n\nuse_repo(npm, \"npm\")\n\npnpm = use_extension(\"@aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"pnpm\")\n\n# Allows developers to use the matching pnpm version, for example:\n# bazel run -- @pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\n```\n\n## Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"aspect_rules_js\",\n    sha256 =

https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2376\n* test: add node16 testing of fs patches by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2377\n* refactor: move AspectWatchProtocol to standalone library by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2374\n* refactor: ensure fs patch tests are run on real fs library by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2378\n* Changes by create-pull-request action by @github-actions[bot] in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2375\n* test: test fs patches via cjs and esm by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2380\n* refactor: improve fs typings by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2383\n* refactor: cleanup importers handling in _get_npm_imports by @dzbarsky in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/2386\n* chore: add missing e2e tests to workflows ci by @jbedard in

version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version =

= \"2.5.0\")\n\n####### Node.js version #########\n# By default you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\n# Optionally you can pin a different node version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"16.14.2\")\n#################################\n\nnpm = use_extension(\"@aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"npm\", dev_dependency = True)\n\nnpm.npm_translate_lock(\n    name = \"npm\",\n

Allows developers to use the matching pnpm version, for example:\n# bazel run -- @pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\n```\n\n## Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste
