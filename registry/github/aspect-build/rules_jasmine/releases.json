BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️\r\n\r\n`jasmine_repositories` repository rule is removed and a new `node_modules` attribute is now required for `jasmine_test`. This change is BREAKING for all users.\r\n\r\nThe `//path/to:node_modules` tree target must be passed to the `jasmine_test` rules via the `node_modules` attribute. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\njasmine_test(\r\n    name = \"test\",\r\n    node_modules = \"//:node_modules\",\r\n    ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need `jasmine` and `jasmine-reporters` linked in the node_modules tree provided. The `jasmine-reporters` requirements can be removed by setting `generate_junit_xml = False` on your `jasmine_test` targets. `jasmine-core` is also required if you use sharding.\r\n\r\nThis change has the added benefits of not requiring users to keep the jasmine version used in their `package.json` in sync with their WORKSPACE and not requiring any changes to `rules_jasmine` to support new releases of jasmine.\r\n\r\nThis change is in the spirit of the change in rules_webpack [v0.11.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_webpack/releases/tag/v0.11.0) and will also be rolled out to rules_jest, rules_rollup & rules_terser in the near future so the patterns on the downstream rules_js rulesets we maintain are aligned both for maintainers and for users.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE
