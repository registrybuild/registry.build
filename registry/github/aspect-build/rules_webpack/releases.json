BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️\r\n\r\n`webpack_repositories` repository rule is removed and a new `node_modules` attribute is now required for both `webpack_bundle` and `webpack_devserver`. This change is BREAKING for all users.\r\n\r\nAfter debugging errors with complex webpack configurations with clients we found that fetching webpack in `webpack_repositories` and linking into a `node_modules` tree within an external Bazel repository can lead to unexpected errors with some webpack plugins that don't expect webpack to be found in multiple `node_modules` trees. To fix this problem in the simplest and most general way, this release removes `webpack_repositories` and now expects users to provide the target to their own `node_modules` trees that must include the `webpack`, `webpack-cli` and, for the `webpack_devserver` rule, also the `webpack-dev-server` npm packages.\r\n\r\nThe `//path/to:node_modules` tree target must be passed to the `webpack_bundle` and `webpack_devserver` rules via the `node_modules` attribute. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebpack_bundle(\r\n    name = \"bundle\",\r\n    node_modules = \"//:node_modules\",\r\n    ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change has the added benefits of not requiring users to keep the webpack version used in their `package.json` in sync with their WORKSPACE and not requiring any changes to `rules_webpack` to support new releases of webpack.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE
