release updates the internal nanobind to v2.4.0. Note that no nanobind v2.3.0 was released by mistake, so this is the next release after v.2.2.0.\r\n\r\nThe only externally observable change is the addition of a `@nanobind_bazel//:nanobind` target that you can use to define your own nanobind-consuming rules and macros when depending on `@nanobind_bazel` in your Bazel module.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add CPython 3.13 to CI test matrix by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/45\r\n* ci: Patch MODULE.bazel in nanobind example by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/46\r\n* Fix job skip condition by interpreting Python version as int by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/47\r\n* Add alias forwarding internal `@nanobind` to users by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/49\r\n* Use `rules_python` free-threading config settings by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/50\r\n* Drop Python 3.8 and 3.9 from GitHub Actions test matrix by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/51\r\n* Bump to v2.4.0 by @nicholasjng in https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/pull/52\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/compare/v2.2.0...v2.4.0","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/180793458","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/180793458/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/180793458/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/tag/v2.2.0","id":180793458,"author":{"login":"nicholasjng","id":54248170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjQ4MTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54248170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng","html_url":"https://github.com/nicholasjng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOJ-JtSs4KxrBy","tag_name":"v2.2.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v2.2.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-10-19T08:27:17Z","published_at":"2024-10-19T08:28:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/assets/200185380","id":200185380,"node_id":"RA_kwDOJ-JtSs4L7pYk","name":"nanobind-bazel-2.2.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"nicholasjng","id":54248170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjQ4MTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54248170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng","html_url":"https://github.com/nicholasjng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicholasjng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":20133,"download_count":14870,"created_at":"2024-10-19T08:31:27Z","updated_at":"2024-10-19T08:31:28Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/releases/download/v2.2.0/nanobind-bazel-2.2.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/tarball/v2.2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/zipball/v2.2.0","body":"**NB:** Re-released due to a Bazel 6.x breakage from an unnecessary rules_cc update.\r\n\r\nThis release bumps nanobind to v2.2.0, which contains support for extension builds targeting free-threaded interpreters (Python 3.13+ only).\r\n\r\nIt also reverts semantic versioning again to match nanobind's, since the decoupling was too unexpected for library users (and versions were never off by one minor, anyway, as nanobind does not release that often).
