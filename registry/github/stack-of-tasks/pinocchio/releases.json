What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Added C++ visualization API, `pinocchio::pinocchio_visualizers` target ([#2574](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2574))\r\n- Added forward declaration for class `SE3Tpl`, and typedef `pinocchio::context::SE3` ([#2574](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2574))\r\n- Add macros PINOCCHIO_COMMON_TYPEDEF and PINOCCHIO_OPTIONS_DEFAULT ([#2574](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2574))\r\n- Add mimic joint support to the following algorithms: ([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n  - Forward kinematics\r\n  - Jacobians and frames\r\n  - Centroid algorithms (ccrba)\r\n  - RNEA\r\n  - CRBA\r\n  - Reachable workspace\r\n- Add `mimic` argument in `pinocchio::urdf::buildModel` to parse URDF mimic field (default to false) ([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n- Add `pinocchio::transformJointIntoMimic` to turn a joint into a mimic joint and `buildMimicModel` to transform multiple joints into mimic joints ([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n- Add `JointModelBase` methods: ([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n  - `nvExtended` to get the DoF of the extended model\r\n  - `idx_vExtended` to get the joint index in the extended vector of velocity\r\n  - `jointExtendedModel{Cols,Rows,Block}` to get joint columns/rows/block in extended model matrix\r\n  - `JointMapped{Config,Velocity}Selector` to get mimicked joint configuration/velocity from the mimicking joint\r\n- Add precomputed members in `DataTpl` to accelerate algorithms on mimic: ([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n  - `idx_vExtended_to_idx_v_fromRow`\r\n  - `mimic_subtree_joint`\r\n  - `mimic_parents_fromRow`\r\n  -

for GeometryObject([#2441](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2441))\r\n- Use [Google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark/tree/main) in benchmarks ([#2607](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2607))\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix `ModelTpl::check()` link ([#2624](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/pull/2624))\r\n- Add missing
