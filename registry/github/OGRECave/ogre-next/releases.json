Leaked summary looks like this:\r\n* [D3D11] Use HlmsManager::_changeRenderSystem() API to release and reaquire RS and device dependent resources on device lost event. Leaked summary looks much better:\r\n* [D3D11] Dump summary of leaked resources on device lost event, right now for PbsMaterials sample it looks like\r\n* [D3D11] device lost handling for D3D11WindowSwapChainBased, D3D11TextureGpu, D3D11RenderPassDescriptor\r\n* Implemented a lot of buffer management code related to VaoManager (WIP) StagingBuffer changes not pushed. Won't compile Affects OGRECave/ogre-next#44\r\n* Bind PSOs Started memory management in VaoManager.\r\n* Bugfix: Validation layers complain about uninitialized variables in blend block Bugfix: Backbuffer always starts in layout undefined Bugfix: Accidental new[] causing uninitialized variables (and leaks) Default to enablePrimitiveRestart = false;\r\n* Bugfix: Wrong if logic checking for success of SPIRV reflection Bugfix: Wrong size of the SPIRV bytecode sent to SPIRV-Reflect Bugfix: Removed dead function Linked against more Vulkan dependencies\r\n* Register VulkanProgramFactory so that GLSL shaders can be compiled Link against all glslang dependencies\r\n* Create dummy vkRenderPass for PSO creation Created VulkanCache HlmsPassPso now also contains resolve information\r\n* Initialize most of PSO entries.\r\n* Integrated glslang to compile GLSL into SPIRV (WIP) Integrated SPIRV-Reflect to obtain data from SPIRV bytecode (WIP) Started implementing PSO creation Descriptors are analyzed and merged, in order to create PSO Compiles, probably won't link in some compilers\r\n* Added FastArray::append\r\n* [Metal] Removed dead code\r\n* Handle swapchain changes Removed TODOs that have already been done\r\n* Bugfix: Tutorial00 would try to render a frame even after the window was closed Redirect Vulkan debug messages to the Log Fixed crashes and race conditions on shutdown\r\n* Fixed swapchain destruction on shutdown\r\n* Recycle semaphores It appears the are no longer leaks every frame during Vulkan rendering Fixed mFrameCount being incremented prematurely\r\n* Second attempt to prevent AppVeyor from trying to build the Vulkan branch\r\n* FastArray::erase and erasePOD shouldn't perform a potentially expensive memmove if there's nothing to remove\r\n* Recycle command buffers. This fixes the biggest memory leak. Semaphores are still being leaked though.\r\n* Perform some rudimentary level of GPU -> CPU synchronization. Now clear colour sustains itself! (doesn't crash) It does crash on exit though. Also it is leaking command buffers and semaphores per frame.\r\n* Move code out of VulkanDevice into VulkanQueue\r\n* Assume graphics queue is also present for now Semaphore logic was flipped The wrong cmd buffers were being submitted Clear colour appeared!!! Shows for one frame then crashes, but it's progress\r\n* Fixed multiple crashes VulkanVaoManager::getAvailableSempaphores was not tracking created semaphores for recycling (recycling still WIP)\r\n* Implemented VulkanVaoManager::getAvailableSempaphores Refactored common error checking into checkVkResult() macro\r\n* Massive update to Vulkan RS Implemented RenderPassDescriptors (WIP) Lots of improvements to VulkanDevice (WIP) Lots of improvements to VulkanWindow and related (WIP) Will build, but may not link on some compilers. Not all functions are implemented.\r\n* Create swapchain\r\n* Initialize queue priorities (error caught by validation layers)\r\n* Check return values from Vulkan for errors Fixed init error in Mesa (missing VK_KHR_surface extension passed to instance creation) Create XCB KHR surface (WIP) Enable validation layer in Debug (WIP, will fail to create device if validation layer is not present)\r\n* Set missing mQueues to nullptr\r\n* Release Vulkan devices on shutdown\r\n* Added VulkanDevice (WIP) Added GPU_IMGTEC vendor (PowerVR)\r\n* Started Vulkan RenderSystem It's mostly an empty skeleton based on NULL and Metal RenderSystem\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OGRECave/ogre-next/releases/55928035/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":23},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OGRECave/ogre-next/releases/55955425","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OGRECave/ogre-next/releases/55955425/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/OGRECave/ogre-next/releases/55955425/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next/releases/tag/v2.2.6","id":55955425,"author":{"login":"darksylinc","id":3395130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTUxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3395130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc","html_url":"https://github.com/darksylinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darksylinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODEMlic4DVc_h","tag_name":"v2.2.6","target_commitish":"v2-2","name":"v2.2.6

Completely refactored Texture code. It consumes a lot less RAM and supports background streaming\r\n* Voxel Cone Tracing (VCT): Semi-Realtime GI solution. Supports diffuse and specular. Can consume a lot of VRAM depending on quality. Lighting changes can be done in realtime. Changes to static objects in scene needs to rebuild voxels (not realtime)\r\n* Irradiance Field with Depth (IFD): Generic variant of DDGI using Voxels (consumes more VRAM) or Rasterization (slower to build). It supports diffuse only and is lower quality than VCT, but is much faster. And if completely static, consumes very little memory.\r\n* Per-pixel Cubemap probes\r\n* VR readiness: New sample showing how to integrate OpenVR SDK, deal with [running start](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/issues/263), performance optimizations such as Instanced Stereo, Hidden Area Mesh and Radial Density Mask\r\n* Mobile friendly: Added Load and Store
