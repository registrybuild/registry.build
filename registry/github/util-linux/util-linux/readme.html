 SCM (Source Code Management) Repository:

    Primary repository:
	  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git

    Backup repository:
	  git clone <a href="https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux.git">https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux.git</a>

    Web interfaces:
	  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git" rel="nofollow">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git</a>
	  <a href="https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux">https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux</a>

      Note: the GitHub repository may contain temporary development branches too.

      The kernel.org repository contains master (current development) and stable/*
      (maintenance) branches only. All master or stable/* changes are always pushed
      to both repositories at the same time.

    Repository Branches: 'git branch -a'
	  Master Branch:
	   - Continuously developed, no feature freeze or translation freezes.
	   - Day-to-day status is: 'it works for me'. This means that its
	     normal state is useful but not well tested.

	  Stable Branches:
	   - Public releases.
	   - Branch name: stable/v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.
	   - Created from the 'master' branch.
	   - The release candidates and final release are always based
             on the stable branch.
	   - Maintenance releases are part of, and belong to, their respective
	     stable branch. As such, they are tags(&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;maint&gt;) and
	     not branches of their own. They are not part of, visible in, or
	     have anything to do with the 'master' development branch. In git
	     terminology: maintenance releases are not reachable from 'master'.
	   - When initially cloned (as with the 'git clone' command given above),
	     these branches are created as 'remote tracking branches' and are
	     only visible by using the -a or -r options to 'git branch'. To
	     create a local branch, use the desired tag with this command:
	     'git checkout -b v2.29.2 v2.29.2'

    Tags: 'git tag'
	   - v&lt;version&gt; tag is created in the stable branch for every release.
	   - v&lt;version&gt;-devel is created in the master branch to start work on the next release.
	   - All tags are signed by the maintainer's PGP key.


WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:

    Development                     Releases
    (Master Branch)                 (Stable/vX.Y Branch)

    - Sync latest translations
      from translationproject.org
    - Tag v&lt;X.Y+1&gt;-devel            - Fork from master to stable/v&lt;X.Y&gt; branch
                                      - Code stabilization
                                    - RC1 (Tag v&lt;X.Y&gt;-rc1)
                                      - Backport bug fixes
                                    - RC2 (Tag v&lt;X.Y&gt;-rc2)
                                      - po/ and po-man/ translations available on
                                        translationproject.org/
                                      - Wait 7-17 days for translators
                                      - Sync latest translations
                                      - Backport bug fixes
                                    - Final release v&lt;X.Y&gt; (Tag v&lt;X.Y&gt;)
                                      ...
                                    - Release v&lt;X.Y&gt;.1
                                      ...
                                    - Release v&lt;X.Y&gt;.2
