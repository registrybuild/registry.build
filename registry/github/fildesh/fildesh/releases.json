`stdout` can be written to once per barrier (#155).\r\n- New `builtin` and `command` builtins that unambiguously invoke a Fildesh builtin or system command (#158).\r\n- New `capture_string` builtin that echoes input lines containing a particular string.\r\n- New `cmptxt` builtin that compares line-by-line, ignoring trivial differences in line endings.\r\n- New `sxpb2yaml` builtin that converts Sxpb format to YAML.\r\n- Sxpb supports multiline strings, bare strings, toplevel arrays, and many more improvements (#152).\r\n  - See https://grencez.dev/2024/sxpb-string-grammar-20240717 for

(https://github.com/fildesh/fildesh/commit/f513d6e98cf117265c2cde76d720d4ca06e20775).\r\n\r\nBreaking:\r\n- The `Filename` type has been renamed as `Filepath` (#161).\r\n- Public Bazel macros have been moved to their own files in `//tool/bazel/` (#146).\r\n- Sxpb arrays now look like `(a (()) 1 2 3)` (https://github.com/fildesh/fildesh/commit/e9421ebbb546cf38bf2051d02fdc38dcf71f8216).\r\n\r\nRemoval:\r\n- `sxproto2textproto` builtin (#142).\r\n- `$(name)`, `$(HF name)`, and `$(H: name)` syntax in

`world_var` (https://github.com/fildesh/fildesh/issues/66).\r\n* Environment variables can be obtained as strings by calling `$(getenv MY_ENV_VAR)` (https://github.com/fildesh/fildesh/issues/67).\r\n  * Fildesh also gains a `-setenv \"MY_ENV_VAR=some value\"` flag to set environment variables.\r\n* Scripts can be split into stages by placing `$(barrier)` between them (https://github.com/fildesh/fildesh/issues/61).\r\n  * It's somewhat restricted.
