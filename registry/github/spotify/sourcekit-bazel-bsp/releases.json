`--index-build-batch-size` to indicate how many targets should be built in parallel during background indexing.\r\n- Added a new `--top-level-rule-to-discover` parameter that allows filtering which types of rules should be considered when not passing `--targets` directly.\r\n- The BSP will now perform one aquery for the entire dependency graph, greatly improving the performance of background indexing.\r\n- The BSP now can index C and C++ files in Obj-C targets.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Log errors that are thrown in Serve.swift by @josh-arnold-1 in
