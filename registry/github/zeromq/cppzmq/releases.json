fixed issues when compiling with C++11\r\n* fixed and improved cmake build (in and out of source builds, `libzmq` discovery, fallback to pkg-config and more)\r\n* updated `README.md` with clear design goals, supported platforms\r\n* official CI support for Linux, MacOS and Windows\r\n* unit tests infrastructure\r\n* test code coverage brought to 77%\r\n* updated code style (more details in .clang-format)\r\n\r\n`socket_t`:\r\n* added support for draft ZMQ_SERVER and ZMQ_CLIENT sockets\r\n* added support for draft ZMQ_RADIO and ZMQ_DISH sockets\r\n\r\n`poller_t`:\r\n* `poller_t` became thin abstraction layer on `zmq_poller_*`\r\n* functionality with std::function handlers split and moved to a new `active_poller_t` in `zmq_addon.hpp`\r\n* simpler and safer implementation\r\n* made non-copyable, but properly movable\r\n* more consistent and robust error handling\r\n* event type part of handler definition\r\n* fixed a segfault issue when modifying poller_t from a handler\r\n* added `empty` method indicating presence of registered sockets\r\n\r\n`context_t`:\r\n* added methods for context options: `setctxopt(int option_, int optval_)` and `int getctxopt(int option_)`\r\n\r\n`message_t`: \r\n* easier construction from iterable type e.g. `std::string`, `std::array`\r\n* added `!=` and `==` operators and `equals` method marked as deprecated \r\n\r\n`multipart_t`:\r\n* added an `operator<<(std::ostream)` to easily print out `multipart_t` content\r\n\r\nFull list of pull requests merged in this release:\r\n- [**closed**] Problem: #209 and
