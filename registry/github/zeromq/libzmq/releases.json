version 4.3.3 stable, released on 2020/09/07\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n* Security advisories:\r\n  * CVE-2020-15166: Denial-of-Service on CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by\r\n    unauthenticated clients.\r\n    If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully\r\n    configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange\r\n    any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to\r\n    the library, but the server application never receives them.\r\n    For more information see the security advisory:\r\n    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m\r\n  * Stack overflow on server running PUB/XPUB socket (CURVE disabled).\r\n    The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive\r\n    function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are\r\n    NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the\r\n    length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote\r\n    clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An\r\n    attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such\r\n    that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.\r\n    For more information see the security advisory:\r\n    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8\r\n  * Memory leak in PUB server induced by malicious client(s) without CURVE/ZAP.\r\n    Messages with metadata are never processed by PUB sockets, but the metadata\r\n    is kept referenced in the PUB object and never freed.\r\n    For more information see the security advisory:\r\n    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw\r\n  * Memory leak in client induced by malicious server(s) without CURVE/ZAP.\r\n    When a pipe processes a delimiter and is already not in active state but\r\n    still has an unfinished message, the message is leaked.\r\n    For more information see the security advisory:\r\n    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87\r\n  * Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packets (CURVE disabled).\r\n    By crafting a packet which is not valid ZMTP v2/v3, and which has two\r\n    messages larger than 8192 bytes, the decoder can be tricked into changing\r\n    the recorded size of the 8192 bytes static buffer, which then gets overflown\r\n    by the next message. The content that gets written in the overflown memory\r\n    is entirely decided by the sender.\r\n    For more information see the security advisory:\r\n    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6\r\n\r\n* Note for packagers: an external, self-contained sha1 library is now\r\n  included in the source tree under external/sha1/ - it is licensed\r\n  under BSD-3-Clause and thus it is fully compatible with libzmq's\r\n  license.\r\n  It is only used if WebSockets support is enabled, and if neither GnuTLS nor\r\n  NSS are available.\r\n\r\n* Note for packagers: an internal reimplementation of strlcpy is now included,\r\n  for wider platform compatibility.\r\n  libbsd can be used and is enabled by default if available instead of the\r\n  internal implementation, for better security maintenance in distros.\r\n\r\n* Note for packagers: ZeroMQConfig.cmake is now installed in the arch-dependent\r\n  subdirectory - eg: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type:\r\n  - ZMQ_CHANNEL is a thread-safe alternative to ZMQ_PAIR.\r\n  See doc/zmq_socket.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket option:\r\n  - ZMQ_ONLY_FIRST_SUBSCRIBE will cause only the first part of a multipart\r\n    message to be processed as a subscribe/unsubscribe message, and the rest\r\n    will be forwarded as user data to the application.\r\n  - ZMQ_RECONNECT_STOP will cause a connecting socket to stop trying to\r\n    reconnect in specific circumstances. See the manpage for details.\r\n  - ZMQ_HELLO_MSG to set a message that will be automatically sent to a new\r\n    connection.\r\n  - ZMQ_DISCONNECT_MSG to set a message that will be automatically received when\r\n    a peer disconnects.\r\n  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_ctx_get_ext/zmq_ctx_set_ext APIs were added\r\n  to allow enhancing the context options with variable data inputs.\r\n  See doc/zmq_ctx_get_ext.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_set_ext.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) transport options WS and WSS added for support\r\n  of WebSockets (and secure WebSockets via TLS) via the ZWS 2.0 protocol.\r\n  WSS requires the GnuTLS library for TLS support. ZMQ_WSS_ specific socket\r\n  options were added to support TLS.\r\n  WebSockets support is disabled by default if DRAFT APIs are disabled.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type, PEER, which is thread safe and a\r\n  related zmq_connect_peer function which atomically and thread-safely connects\r\n  and returns a routing-id.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_msg_init_buffer API was added to allow\r\n  the construction of a message by copying from an existing buffer.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_poller_size API was added to allow querying\r\n  the number of sockets/fds registered in a zmq_poller.\r\n\r\n* ZMTP 3.1 peers will receive subscribe/cancel on PUB/SUB via commands rather\r\n  than using the first byte of the payload.\r\n\r\n* zmq_z85_decode now checks that the input string's length is at least 5 characters\r\n  and always a multiple of 5 as per API specification.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3566 - malformed CURVE message can cause memory leak\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3567 - missing ZeroMQ_INCLUDE_DIR in ZeroMQConfig.cmake when only\r\n                static lib is built\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3576 - CURVE plaintext secrets now stored in libsodium's secure

version 4.3.2 stable, released on 2019/07/08\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n* CVE-2019-13132: a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a\r\n  libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE\r\n  encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and\r\n  overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in\r\n  the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration\r\n  are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no\r\n  known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.\r\n  Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_socket_monitor_versioned API that supports\r\n  a versioned monitoring events protocol as a parameter. Passing 1 results in\r\n  the same behaviour as zmq_socket_monitor.\r\n  Version 2 of the events protocol allows new events, new metadata, different\r\n  socket types for the monitors and more. It is described in details in\r\n  doc/zmq_socket_monitor_versioned.txt\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_socket_monitor_pipes_stats that triggers\r\n  a new ZMQ_EVENT_PIPES_STATS to be delivered via zmq_socket_monitor_versioned\r\n  v2 API, which contains the current status of all the queues owned by the\r\n  monitored socket. See doc/zmq_socket_monitor_versioned.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_poller_fd that returns the FD of a thread\r\n  safe socket. See doc/zmq_poller.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:\r\n  - ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL_LAST_VALUE is similar to ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL but allows to avoid\r\n    duplicates when using last value caching.\r\n  - ZMQ_SOCKS_USERNAME and ZMQ_SOCKS_PASSWORD that implement SOCKS5 proxy\r\n    authentication.\r\n  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* Implemented background thread names for Windows, when the Visual Studio\r\n  debugger is being used.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3358 - test_security_zap failing due to SIGBUS on SPARC64, hard-coded\r\n                IPC socket binds in tests cause race conditions\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3361 - enabling GSSAPI support (when using autools) does not work due\r\n                to regression introduced in 4.2.3\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3362 - remove documentation for ZMQ_THREAD_PRIORITY context option\r\n                getter, it's not implemented\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3363 - tests fail to build due to stricter compiler printf validation\r\n                in new versions of GCC\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3367 - try to infer cacheline size at build time, first with\r\n                getconf LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE, and then by reading\r\n                /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/coherency_line_size\r\n                (autoconf only), and only then falling back to the previous\r\n                default of 64 bytes.

       Prefer c++11 atomic primitives to compiler intrinsics, when\r\n                both are available, as the former is more reliable.\r\n                Set test_pair_ipc and test_rebind_ipc to XFAIL on GNU/Hurd due\r\n                to non-functioning getsockname on AF_UNIX.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3370 - Make queue length and HWM state observable\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3373 - performance regression in zmq_poll on CentOS 6/7\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3375 - assign names to all pthreads created by the library to ease\r\n                debugging\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3376 - assigned random TIPC port is not returned by ZMQ_LAST_ENDPOINT\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3385 - TCP port in ZMQ_LAST_ENDPOINT depends on global locale\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3404 - use std::condition_variable_any when possible\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3436 - reconnect interval exponential backoff and may lead to integer\r\n                overflows\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3440 - improve zmq_proxy performance by batching of up to 1000\r\n                consecutive messages (if any) and add perf/proxy_thr tool\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3451 - fix support of /dev/poll on Solaris\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3452 - strnlen may not be available\r\n\r\n* Fixed #1462 - test failure in test_filter_ipc due to invalid system groups\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3269 - Boost.ASIO integration stopped working with v4.3.0\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3479 - ZeroMQ does not build for QNX 6.6 with CMake\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3481 - add <ios> include to fix uClibc++ compilation\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3491 - build broken on Fedora 30\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3494 - ZeroMQConfig.cmake fails if shared libraries are not built\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3498 - syntax error on Windows related to socket descriptor type\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3500 - PLAIN HELLO message incorrectly uses WELCOME literal, regression\r\n                introduced in 4.3.0\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3517 - configure errors because of syntax errors in the use of test\r\n                shell command\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3521 - document how to achieve high performance with the PGM transport\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3526 - failure case behavior unclear in zmq_msg_send documentation\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3537 - fix build on z/OS by using pthread_equal instead of comparing\r\n

to and execute from an address indicated by the attacker.\r\n  This issue has been present since v4.2.0. Older releases are not affected.\r\n  NOTE: The attacker needs to know in advance valid addresses in the peer's\r\n  memory to jump to, so measures like ASLR are effective mitigations.\r\n  NOTE: this attack can only take place after authentication, so peers behind\r\n  CURVE/GSSAPI are not vulnerable to unauthenticated attackers.\r\n  See https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351 for more details.\r\n  Thanks to Guido Vranken for uncovering the issue and providing the fix!\r\n\r\n* Note for packagers: as pkg-config's Requires.private is now used to properly\r\n  propagate dependencies for static builds, the libzmq*-dev or zeromq-devel or\r\n  equivalent package should now depend on the libfoo-dev or foo-devel packages\r\n  of all the libraries that zmq is linked against, or pkg-config --libs libzmq\r\n  will fail due to missing dependencies on end users machines.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3351 - remote code execution vulnerability.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3343 - race condition in ZMQ_PUSH when quickly disconnecting and\r\n                reconnecting causes last part of multi-part message to get\r\n                \"stuck\" and resent by mistake to the new socket.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3336 - set Requires.private in generate pkg-config file.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3334 - set TCP_NODELAY after connect() on Windows for the I/O socket.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3326 - assert on Android when opening a socket and disabling WiFi.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3320 - build failure on OpenBSD with GCC."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeromq/libzmq/releases/14241263","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeromq/libzmq/releases/14241263/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zeromq/libzmq/releases/14241263/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.0","id":14241263,"author":{"login":"sappo","id":493242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzI0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo","html_url":"https://github.com/sappo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sappo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE0MjQxMjYz","tag_name":"v4.3.0","target_commitish":"eff190d5031d313451505f323d3dd1c38ab9c25c","name":"libzmq

version 4.3.0 stable, released on 2018/11/28\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n* The following DRAFT APIs have been marked as STABLE and will not change\r\n  anymore:\r\n  - ZMQ_MSG_T_SIZE context option (see doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt)\r\n  - ZMQ_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_ADD and ZMQ_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_REMOVE (Posix only)\r\n    context options, to add/remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads.\r\n    See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.\r\n  - ZMQ_THREAD_NAME_PREFIX (Posix only) context option, to add a specific\r\n    integer prefix to the background threads names, to easily identify them.\r\n    See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.\r\n  - ZMQ_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE and ZMQ_GSSAPI_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE\r\n    socket options, for the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional\r\n    definitions for principal name types:\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_HOSTBASED\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_USER_NAME\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_KRB5_PRINCIPAL\r\n    See doc/zmq_gssapi.txt for details.\r\n  - ZMQ_BINDTODEVICE socket option (Linux only), which will bind the\r\n    socket(s) to the specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:\r\n    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt\r\n    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP_NET_RAW\r\n  - zmq_timers_* APIs. These functions can be used for cross-platforms timed\r\n    callbacks. See doc/zmq_timers.txt for details.\r\n  - The following socket monitor events:\r\n    - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_NO_DETAIL: unknown errors during handshake.\r\n    - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEEDED: Handshake completed with authentication.\r\n    - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_PROTOCOL: Protocol errors with peers or ZAP.\r\n    - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_AUTH: Failed authentication requests.\r\n    See doc/zmq_socket_monitor.txt for more details and error codes.\r\n  - zmq_stopwatch_intermediate which returns the time elapsed without stopping\r\n    the stopwatch.\r\n  - zmq_proxy_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to retrieve stats about the amount\r\n    of messages and bytes sent and received by the proxy.\r\n    See doc/zmq_proxy_steerable.txt for more information.\r\n\r\n* The build-time configuration option to select the poller has been split, and\r\n  new API_POLLER (CMake) and --with-api-poller (autoconf) options will now\r\n  determine what system call is used to implement the zmq_poll/zmq_poller APIs.\r\n  The previous POLLER and --with-poller options now only affects the\r\n  internal I/O thread. In case API_POLLER is not specified, the behaviour keeps\r\n  backward compatibility intact and will be the same as with previous releases.\r\n\r\n* The non-default \"poll\" poller for the internal I/O thread (note: NOT for the\r\n  zmq_poll/zmq_poller user APIs!) has been disabled on Windows as WSAPoll does\r\n  not report connection failures. For more information see:\r\n  - https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/10/10/wsapoll-is-broken/\r\n  - https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-10/0038.html\r\n  - https://bugs.python.org/issue16507\r\n\r\n* New epoll implementation for Windows, using the following implementation:\r\n  https://github.com/piscisaureus/wepoll/tree/v1.5.4\r\n  To use this, select \"epoll\" as the poller option in the build system.\r\n  Note for distributors: the wepoll source code is embedded and distributed.\r\n  It is licensed under the BSD-2-Clause and thus it is compatible with LGPL-3.0.\r\n  Note that, if selected at build time, the license text must be distributed\r\n  with the binary in accordance to the license terms. A copy can be found at:\r\n  external/wepoll/license.txt\r\n\r\n* The pre-made Visual Studio solutions file are deprecated, and users are\r\n  encouraged to use the CMake solution generation feature instead.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:\r\n  - ZMQ_ROUTER_NOTIFY to deliver a notification when a peer connects and/or\r\n    disconnects in the form of a routing id plus a zero-length frame.\r\n  - ZMQ_MULTICAST_LOOP to control whether the data sent should be looped back\r\n    on local listening sockets for UDP multicast sockets (ZMQ_RADIO).\r\n  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New perf tool, perf/benchmark_radix_tree, to measure the performance of the\r\n  different internal implementations of the trie algorithm used to track\r\n  subscriptions. Requires a compiler that supports C++11.\r\n\r\n* New autoconf flag \"--enable-force-CXX98-compat\" which will force -std=gnu++98\r\n  and, if the compiler supports them (clang++ at the moment), it will also add\r\n  -Wc++98-compat -Wc++98-compat-pedantic so that compatibility with C++98 can\r\n  be tested.\r\n\r\n* Many, many coding style, duplication and static analysis improvements.\r\n\r\n* Many, many improvements to the CMake build system, especially on Windows.\r\n\r\n* Many, many improvements to unit tests.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3036 - Compilation error when -pedantic is used.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3028 - Failure when zmq_poller_destroy is called after zmq_ctx_term.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2989 - CMake: Linker PDB install rule does not work when Visual Studio\r\n                generators are used.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3045 - configure.ac: search for dladdr only when using libunwind.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3060 - REQ sockets terminate TCP connection after first heartbeat if\r\n                ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL is set.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2212 - UDP: need ability to specify bind address separately from\r\n                multicast address for multi-homed hosts.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2891 - UDP: address name resolution is limited to dotted IPv4 rather\r\n                than being capable of IPv4, IPv6, and hostname lookup.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3085 - autoconf/CMake getrandom test does not check if it's working but\r\n                only for its presence.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3090 - compilation broken with Solaris Studio.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3094 - UDP: pass interface via IP[V6]_MULTICAST_IF if provided.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3061 - implement ZMTP 3.1 ping/pong context sending/receiving.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2188 - Added documentation for new zmq_poller API.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3088 - zmq_poller_add/zmq_poller_modify should reject invalid events\r\n                arguments.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3042 - Fixed compilation on ARM with ZMQ_ATOMIC_PTR_MUTEX.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3107 - test_immediate_3/test_reconnect_inproc do not terminate with\r\n                POLL as the I/O thread poller under Windows.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3046 - Aborts when iOS abuses EBADF to report a socket has been\r\n                reclaimed.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3136 - Cannot set ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TTL to more than 655.3 seconds.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3083 - link with -latomic when needed.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3162 - build failure with MUSL libc.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3158 - -1 value of ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL was not correctly handled on some\r\n                platforms.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3170 - improved documentation for ZMQ_PAIR.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3168 - correctly use symbols map on Debian/kFreeBSD and Debian/HURD\r\n                to avoid exporting standard library symbols.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3168 - correctly process ZMTP 3.1 cancel/subscribe commands.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3171 - improve documentation for ZMQ_CONFLATE.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2876 - stack overflow on Windows 64.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3191 - race condition with received message causes\r\n                ZMQ_CONNECT_ROUTING_ID to be assigned to wrong socket.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3005 - added documentation for new zmq_timers_* API.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3222 - use /Z7 debug on Release builds too on Windows (CMake).\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3226 - possible PGM receiver crash.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3236 - UDP dish socket can't bind to a multicast port already in use.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3242 - improve HWM documentation.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2488 - improve zmq_msg_send doc return value documentation.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3268 - HWM in ZMQ_DGRAM socket does not respect multipart message.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3284 - added support for ZMQ_MULTICAST_HOPS with UDP sockets.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3245 - use-after-free reported in zmq::pipe_t::terminate.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #1400 - use patricia trie for subscription to improve performances and\r\n                memory usage. Note: only active in DRAFT builds for now.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3263 - fix abort on Windows when a large TCP read is requested and\r\n                fails.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #3312 - fix build on Android

version 4.2.3 stable, released on 2017/12/13\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n* API change: previously ZMQ_POLLOUT on a ZMQ_ROUTER socket returned always\r\n  true due to how the type works. When ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY is set, sending\r\n  fails when the peer is not available, but ZMQ_POLLOUT always returns true\r\n  anyway, which does not make sense. Now when ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY is set,\r\n  ZMQ_POLLOUT on a ZMQ_ROUTER will return true only if at least one peer is\r\n  available.\r\n  Given ZMQ_POLLOUT with ZMQ_ROUTER was not usable at all previously, we do\r\n  not consider this a breakage warranting a major or minor version increase.\r\n\r\n* ZMQ_IDENTITY has been renamed to ZMQ_ROUTING_ID and ZMQ_CONNECT_RID has been\r\n  renamed to ZMQ_CONNTECT_ROUTING_ID to disambiguate. ZMQ_IDENTITY and\r\n  ZMQ_CONNECT_RID are still available to keep backward compatibility, and will\r\n  be removed in a future release after further advance notice.\r\n\r\n* DRAFT API change: zmq_poller_wait, zmq_poller_wait_all and zmq_poller_poll\r\n  have been changed to be inline with other existing APIs that have a timeout\r\n  to return EAGAIN instead of ETIMEDOUT as the errno value.\r\n  See #2713 for details.\r\n\r\n* Existing non-DRAFT socket types ZMQ_REP/REQ, ZMQ_ROUTER/DEALER and\r\n  ZMQPUB/SUB, that were previously declared deprecated, have been reinstated\r\n  as stable and supported. See #2699 for details.\r\n\r\n* Tweetnacl: add support for, and use preferably if available, getrandom() as\r\n  a simpler and less error-prone alternative to /dev/urandom on OSes where it\r\n  is available (eg: Linux 3.18 with glibc 2.25).\r\n\r\n* Curve: all remaining traces of debug output to console are now removed, and\r\n  new DRAFT events are available to properly debug CURVE, PLAIN, GSSAPI and\r\n  ZAP events and failures. See below for details on the new events.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:\r\n  - ZMQ_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE and ZMQ_GSSAPI_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE, for\r\n    the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional definitions for principal\r\n    name types:\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_HOSTBASED\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_USER_NAME\r\n    - ZMQ_GSSAPI_NT_KRB5_PRINCIPAL\r\n    See doc/zmq_gssapi.txt for details.\r\n  - ZMQ_BINDTODEVICE (Linux only), which will bind the socket(s) to the\r\n    specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:\r\n    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt\r\n    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP_NET_RAW\r\n  - ZMQ_ZAP_ENFORCE_DOMAIN, enables strict RFC 27 compatibility mode and makes\r\n    the ZAP Domain mandatory when using security. See:\r\n    https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27/ZAP\r\n  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) context options:\r\n  - ZMQ_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_ADD and ZMQ_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_REMOVE (Posix only),\r\n    to add and remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads. Useful to pin\r\n    the background threads to specific CPUs.\r\n  - ZMQ_THREAD_NAME_PREFIX (Posix only), to add a specific integer prefix to the\r\n    background threads names, to easily identify them for debugging purposes.\r\n  See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) message property name definitions to facilitate\r\n  the use of zmq_msg_gets:\r\n  - ZMQ_MSG_PROPERTY_ROUTING_ID\r\n  - ZMQ_MSG_PROPERTY_SOCKET_TYPE\r\n  - ZMQ_MSG_PROPERTY_USER_ID\r\n  - ZMQ_MSG_PROPERTY_PEER_ADDRESS\r\n  See doc/zmq_msg_gets.txt for details.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) API zmq_socket_get_peer_state, to be used to\r\n  query the state of a specific peer (via routing-id) of a ZMQ_ROUTER socket.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) Socket Monitor events:\r\n  - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_NO_DETAIL, unknown system error and returns errno\r\n  - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEEDED, handshake was successful\r\n  - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_PROTOCOL, protocol errors between peers or server\r\n    and ZAP handler. Returns one of ZMQ_PROTOCOL_ERROR_* - see manpage for list\r\n  - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_AUTH, failed authentication, returns ZAP status\r\n  These events trigger when the ZMTP security mechanism handshake is\r\n  completed or failed. See doc/zmq_socket_monitor.txt for more information.\r\n\r\n* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_proxy_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to\r\n  retrieve stats about the amount of messages and bytes sent and received by\r\n  the proxy. See doc/zmq_proxy_steerable.txt for more information.\r\n\r\n* Add new autoconf --disable-libunwind option to stop building with libunwind\r\n  even if it is available.\r\n\r\n* Add new autoconf --disable-Werror option to avoid building with the Werror\r\n  flag.\r\n\r\n* Use pkg-config as the first method for finding and building with external\r\n  optional dependencies such as libnorm, libpgm and gssapi.\r\n\r\n* On Posix platform where the feature is available, name the ZMQ background\r\n  threads to simplify debugging: \"ZMQbg/<num_thread>\"\r\n\r\n* Improve performance of zmq_poller_* (and zmq_poll and zmq_proxy when building\r\n  with DRAFT APIs enabled).\r\n\r\n* The TCP unit tests have been refactored to bind and connect to random ports\r\n  rather than hard-coded ones, to allow running tests in parallel.\r\n  There are 6 exceptions where it is necessary to use an hard-coded port to\r\n  test specific code paths that would not be exercised when binding to a\r\n  wildcard port. These are listed in tests/testutil.hpp so that distributions\r\n  can easily patch them if they wish to and so that they can be unique across\r\n  all the tests, allowing parallel runs.\r\n  The IPC unit tests have been changed as well to use unique socket file names\r\n  per test, where before there were some clashes.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2349 - fix building with libsodium when using CMake\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2334 - do not assert when tuning socket options fails due to network\r\n  errors, but simply retry again when connecting or send a socket monitor\r\n  ZMQ_EVENT_ACCEPT_FAILED event when binding\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2341 - fix source files path in VS2015 solution\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2344 - Note that on Windows with VS2012 it is mandatory to increase\r\n  the default stack size to at least 2MB\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2348 - ZMQ_ROUTER send with ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY can be stuck in case of\r\n  network problem\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2358 - occasional abort on zmq_connect on Windows\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2370 - zmq_curve_keypair should return an error on failure rather\r\n  than ignoring them and always returning 0\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2452 - __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS before precompiled headers causes VC++\r\n  warning\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2457 - fix building with libsodium in Visual Studio solutions\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2466 - add const qualifier to internal and public API that does not\r\n  modify parameters\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2471 - do more checks for OOM conditions when dynamic allocations is\r\n  used\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2476 - assertion causes abort after ZAP stop at shutdown\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2479 - improve zmq_poller performance on Windows\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2481 - potential memory leaks due to ZMTP handshake failures\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2531 - ZMQ_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL sockopt has no effect on client side\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2535 - add BUILD_SHARED and BUILD_STATIC options to CMake, both on by\r\n  default, to toggle shared and static library builds\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2537 - use SYSTEM_CLOCK on OSX and CLOCK_MONOTONIC elsewhere for\r\n  internal timers to avoid races\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2540 - new zmq_poller used by zmq_poll without DRAFTs\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2552 - Fix WITH_DOC CMake build to avoid checking for asciidoc if the\r\n  option is disabled\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2567 - Memory leak in REP socket handling\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2579 - Compilation issue on Windows with CMake + ninja\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2588 - SIGBUS under 64-bit SunOS Sparc\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2590 - crash when using ZMQ_IMMEDIATE and ZMQ_LINGER to non-zero\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2601 - XPUB_MANUAL subscriptions not removed on peer term\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2602 - intermittent memory leak for ZMQ_REQ/REP send/recv\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2608 - CURVE server (connect) fails when client rebinds\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2610 - print backtraces in mutual exclusion to avoid mixing\r\n  different traces\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2621 - add missing CMake files to distributable tarball\r\n\r\n* Fixed #2630 - improve compatibility with OpenBSD w.r.t.

0MQ version 4.2.0 stable, released on 2016/11/04\n- For Pieter. Thanks for making all of this possible.\n  \n  \"Tell them I was a writer.\n  A maker of software.\n  A humanist. A father.\n  And many things.\n  But above all, a writer.\n  Thank You. :)\"\n  - Pieter Hintjens\n- This release introduces new APIs, but it is ABI compatible with\n  libzmq 4.1.2 and up.\n- Note for ARM and SPARC users: an alignment problem in zmq_msg_t that could in\n  some cases and on some CPUs cause a SIGBUS error was solved, but it requires\n  a rebuild of your application against the 4.2.0 version of include/zmq.h.\n  To clarify, this change does not affect the internals of the library but only\n  the public definition of zmq_msg_t, so there is no ABI incompatibility.\n- Security with Curve is now available by default thanks to Tweetnacl sources:\n  https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/index.html\n  Libsodium is still fully supported but has to be enabled with the build flag\n  --with-libsodium. Distribution and package maintainers are encouraged to use\n  libsodium so that the security implementation can be audited and maintained\n  separately.\n- New Context options:\n  - ZMQ_MAX_MSGSZ\n  - ZMQ_BLOCKY\n  \n  See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.\n- New Socket options:\n  - ZMQ_HANDSHAKE_IVL\n  - ZMQ_SOCKS_PROXY\n  - ZMQ_XPUB_NODROP\n  - ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL\n  - ZMQ_XPUB_WELCOME_MSG\n  - ZMQ_STREAM_NOTIFY\n  - ZMQ_INVERT_MATCHING\n  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL\n  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TTL\n  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT\n  - ZMQ_XPUB_VERBOSER\n  - ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\n  - ZMQ_TCP_MAXRT\n  - ZMQ_THREAD_SAFE\n  - ZMQ_MULTICAST_MAXTPDU\n  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_SIZE\n  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE\n  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE\n  - ZMQ_VMCI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\n  - ZMQ_USE_FD\n  \n  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.\n- New CURVE helper function to derive z85 public key from secret key:\n  zmq_curve_public\n- New cross-platform atomic counter helper functions:\n  zmq_atomic_counter_new, zmq_atomic_counter_set, zmq_atomic_counter_inc,\n  zmq_atomic_counter_dec, zmq_atomic_counter_value, zmq_atomic_counter_destroy\n  See doc/zmq_atomic_*.txt for details.\n- New DRAFT APIs early-release mechanism. New APIs will be introduced early\n  in public releases, and until they are stabilized and guaranteed not to\n  change anymore they will be unavailable unless the new build flag\n  --enable-drafts is used. This will allow developers and early adopters to\n  test new APIs before they are finalized.\n  NOTE: as the name implies, NO GUARANTEE is made on the stability of these APIs.\n  They might change or disappear entirely. Distributions are recommended NOT to\n  build with them.\n  \n  New socket types have been introduced in DRAFT state:\n    ZMQ_SERVER, ZMQ_CLIENT, ZMQ_RADIO, ZMQ_DISH, ZMQ_GATHER, ZMQ_SCATTER,\n    ZMQ_DGRAM\n  All these sockets are THREAD SAFE, unlike the existing socket types. They do\n  NOT support multipart messages (ZMQ_SNDMORE/ZMQ_RCVMORE).\n  ZMQ_RADIO, ZMQ_DISH and ZMQ_DGRAM also support UDP as transport,\n  both unicast and multicast. See doc/zmq_udp.txt for more details.\n  New methods to support the new socket types functionality:\n    zmq_join, zmq_leave, zmq_msg_set_routing_id, zmq_msg_routing_id,\n    zmq_msg_set_group, zmq_msg_group\n  See doc/zmq_socket.txt for more details.\n  \n  New poller mechanism and APIs have been introduced in DRAFT state:\n    zmq_poller_new, zmq_poller_destroy, zmq_poller_add, zmq_poller_modify,\n    zmq_poller_remove, zmq_poller_wait, zmq_poller_wait_all, zmq_poller_add_fd\n    zmq_poller_modify_fd, zmq_poller_remove_fd\n  and a new supporting struct typedef: zmq_poller_event_t\n  They support existing socket type, new thread-safe socket types and file\n  descriptors (cross-platform).\n  Documentation will be made available in the future before these APIs are declared\n  stable.\n  \n  New cross-platform timers helper functions have been introduced in DRAFT state:\n    zmq_timers_new, zmq_timers_destroy, zmq_timers_add, zmq_timers_cancel,\n    zmq_timers_set_interval, zmq_timers_reset, zmq_timers_timeout,\n    zmq_timers_execute\n  and a new supporting callback typedef: zmq_timer_fn\n- Many, many bug fixes. The most important fixes are backported and captured in the\n  4.1.x and 4.0.x changelogs.\n\n# 0MQ version 4.2.0 rc1, released on 2016/11/01\n- Many changes, see ChangeLog.\n\n# 0MQ version 4.1.6
