The `Tags` class has been removed. You now pass a `char const*` directly to the macros.\r\n  Additionally, macros previously named `WITH_TAGS` have been renamed to `_TAGS`. For example, `LOG_INFO_WITH_TAGS` is\r\n  now `LOG_INFO_TAGS`.\r\n- Renamed `backend_cpu_affinity` to `cpu_affinity` in `BackendOptions` to improve consistency.\r\n- Simplified project structure by removing the extra quill directory and made minor CMake improvements; `include/quill` is now directly in the root.\r\n- Added support for `std::string` with custom allocator. ([#524](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/524))\r\n- Added a new log level `NOTICE`, for capturing significant events that aren't errors or warnings. It fits between `INFO` and `WARNING` for logging important runtime events that require attention. ([#526](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/526))\r\n- Enhanced static assert error message for unsupported codecs, providing clearer guidance for STL and user-defined types.\r\n- Improved frontend performance by caching the `ThreadContext` pointer in `Logger` class to avoid repeated function calls. On Linux, this is now further optimised with `__thread` for thread-local storage, while other platforms still use `thread_local`.\r\n- Minor performance enhancement in the frontend by replacing `std::vector<size_t>` with an `InlinedVector<uint32_t, 12>` for caching sizes (e.g. string arguments).\r\n- Fixed order of evaluation for `Codec::pair<T1,T2>::compute_encoded_size()` to prevent side effects observed on MSVC\r\n- Introduced the `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` option in `PatternFormatter`. This option, now enabled by default, appends metadata such as timestamps and log levels to every line of multiline log entries, ensuring consistent log output. To restore the previous behavior, set this option to false when creating a `Logger` using `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)`. Note that this option is ignored when logging JSON using named arguments in the format message. ([#534](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/534))\r\n- `JSON` sinks now automatically remove any `\\n` characters from format messages, ensuring the emission of valid `JSON` messages even when `\\n` is present in the format.\r\n- Replaced `static` variables with `static constexpr` in the `ConsoleColours` class.\r\n- Fixed compiler errors in a few rarely used macros. Added a comprehensive test for all macros to prevent similar issues in the future.\r\n- Expanded terminal list for color detection in console applications on Linux\r\n- Fixed an issue where `char*` and `char[]` types could be incorrectly selected by the Codec template in `Array.h`\r\n- The library no longer defines `__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__`, as the bounds-checking functions from the extensions are no longer needed.\r\n- `StringFromTime` constructor no longer relies on the system's current time, improving performance in simulations where timestamps differ from system time. ([#541](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/541))\r\n- The `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)` function now accepts a `PatternFormatterOptions` parameter, simplifying the API. This is a breaking change. To migrate quickly, wrap the existing formatting parameters in a `PatternFormatterOptions` object.\r\n\r\n  **Before:**\r\n  ```c++\r\n    quill::Logger* logger =\r\n      quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger(\"root\", std::move(file_sink),\r\n                                            \"%(time) [%(thread_id)] %(short_source_location:<28) \"\r\n                                            \"LOG_%(log_level:<9) %(logger:<12) %(message)\",\r\n                                            \"%H:%M:%S.%Qns\", quill::Timezone::GmtTime);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  **After:**\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    quill::Logger* logger =\r\n      quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger(\"root\", std::move(file_sink), quill::PatternFormatterOptions {\r\n                                            \"%(time) [%(thread_id)] %(short_source_location:<28) \"\r\n                                            \"LOG_%(log_level:<9) %(logger:<12) %(message)\",\r\n

For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    struct TCStruct\r\n    {\r\n      int a;\r\n      double b;\r\n      char c[12];\r\n      \r\n      friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, TCStruct const& arg)\r\n      {\r\n        os << \"a: \" << arg.a << \", b: \" << arg.b << \", c: \" << arg.c;\r\n        return os;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template <>\r\n    struct fmtquill::formatter<TCStruct> : fmtquill::ostream_formatter\r\n    {\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template <>\r\n    struct quill::Codec<TCStruct> : quill::TriviallyCopyableTypeCodec<TCStruct>\r\n    {\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n      // init code ...\r\n      \r\n      TCStruct tc;\r\n      tc.a = 123;\r\n      tc.b = 321;\r\n      tc.c[0] = '\\0';\r\n      LOG_INFO(logger, \"{}\", tc);\r\n    }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Added support for passing arithmetic or enum c style arrays when `std/Array.h` is included. For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    #include \"quill/std/Array.h\"\r\n  \r\n    int a[6] = {123, 456};\r\n    LOG_INFO(logger, \"a {}\", a);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Added support for `void const*` formatting. For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n      int a = 123;\r\n      int* b = &a;\r\n      LOG_INFO(logger, \"{}\", fmt::ptr(b));\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Added support for formatting `std::chrono::time_point` and `std::chrono::duration` with the inclusion\r\n  of `quill/std/Chrono.h`\r\n\r\n   ```c++\r\n   #include \"quill/std/Chrono.h\"\r\n  \r\n   std::chrono::system_clock::time_point now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n   LOG_INFO(logger, \"time is {}\", now);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n- Removed unused method from `ConsoleSink`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/167476453/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":2,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/166401325","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/166401325/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/166401325/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v5.1.0","id":166401325,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4J6xUt","tag_name":"v5.1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v5.1.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-07-21T10:58:59Z","published_at":"2024-07-21T11:55:18Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/assets/180905598","id":180905598,"node_id":"RA_kwDODfWAZs4KyGZ-","name":"quill-5.1.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":2014237,"download_count":23,"created_at":"2024-07-21T11:55:39Z","updated_at":"2024-07-21T11:55:40Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/download/v5.1.0/quill-5.1.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v5.1.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v5.1.0","body":"- Fix unit tests on FreeBSD ([#496](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/496))\r\n- Resolved unused variable warning on MSVC.\r\n- Updated CMake to avoid adding `-fno-exceptions` to the entire target when `QUILL_NO_EXCEPTIONS=ON` ([#499](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/499))\r\n- Fix an issue where timestamps were incorrectly calculated when using `quill::Timezone::LocalTime`. This bug affected timezones that did not have an exact hour difference from UTC, leading to incorrect timestamp calculations. ([#498](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/498))\r\n- The newline character `\\n` is now considered printable by default and will no longer be sanitized. Users can now include new lines in their logs directly. In versions `4.4.1` and earlier, `\\n` was not sanitized, and this behavior is restored in this update, eliminating the need for a custom `check_printable_char` function in `BackendOptions`.\r\n- On Windows, when colors are enabled in `ConsoleSink`, `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` may fail in the debug console. Previously, this would result in an error being displayed but no logs being written. This issue is now resolved: the error is reported once, and logs will be written to the console without colors.\r\n- Improved performance of `StringFromTime` and `TimestampFormatter` used by the backend worker thread.\r\n- Replaced `std::mutex` with a spinlock, resulting in minor performance improvement for backend worker. This change also avoids including `<mutex>` in the frontend, particularly when following the [recommended_usage](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp)\r\n  example\r\n- Update bundled `libfmt` to `11.0.2`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/166401325/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/165300814","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/165300814/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/165300814/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v5.0.0","id":165300814,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4J2kpO","tag_name":"v5.0.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v5.0.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T13:09:21Z","published_at":"2024-07-13T13:17:54Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/assets/179372653","id":179372653,"node_id":"RA_kwDODfWAZs4KsQJt","name":"quill-5.0.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":1739162,"download_count":20,"created_at":"2024-07-13T13:18:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-13T13:18:17Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/download/v5.0.0/quill-5.0.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v5.0.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v5.0.0","body":"- Fix build failure on Windows Arm64 ([#485](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/485))\r\n\r\n- Previously, wide string support was included in `Codec.h`. Wide string functionality has now been moved to a separate header file, `WideStrings.h`. On Windows, logging wide strings now requires the inclusion of `quill/std/WideStrings.h`.\r\n\r\n- Added `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` preprocessor variable. This variable can be defined before including `LogMacros.h` or passed as a compiler flag. When `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` is defined, the library will flush the log on each log statement. This causes the caller thread to wait for the log to be processed and written to the log file by the backend thread before continuing, significantly impacting performance. This feature is useful for debugging the application when synchronized logs are required. ([#488](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/488))\r\n\r\n- Introduced `log_level_descriptions` and `log_level_short_codes` in `BackendOptions` to allow customization of `LogLevel` descriptions and short codes, replacing previously hardcoded values. This enhancement enables users to define their own descriptions and short codes for each log level. For instance, instead of displaying `LOG_WARNING`, it can now be configured to show `LOG_WARN`. ([#489](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/489))\r\n\r\n    ```c++  \r\n    quill::BackendOptions backend_options;\r\n    backend_options.log_level_descriptions[static_cast<uint32_t>(quill::LogLevel::Warning)] = \"WARN\";\r\n    quill::Backend::start(backend_options);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Introduced `LOGV_LEVEL`, `LOGV_LEVEL_LIMIT`, and `LOGV_LEVEL_WITH_TAGS` macros. These new macros simplify logging by automatically printing variable names and values without explicitly specifying each variable name or using `{}` placeholders in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int a = 123;\r\n    double b = 3.17;\r\n    LOGV_INFO(logger, \"A message with two variables\", a, b)\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `A message with two variables [a: 123, b: 3.17]`\r\n\r\n- Introduced `LOGJ_LEVEL`, `LOGJ_LEVEL_LIMIT`, and `LOGJ_LEVEL_WITH_TAGS` macros. These new macros simplify JSON logging by automatically embedding the name of each passed variable as a named argument in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int var_a = 123;\r\n    std::string var_b = \"test\";\r\n    LOGJ_INFO(logger, \"A json message\", var_a, var_b);\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `{\"log_level\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"A json message {var_a}, {var_b}\",\"var_a\":\"123\",\"var_b\":\"test\"}`\r\n\r\n- Enhanced the `filter` function to also receive the formatted `log_message` alongside the log_statement, enabling the comparison and filtering of `log_message` while disregarding elements like timestamps from the full `log_statement`. ([#493](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/493))\r\n\r\n- Renamed `log_message` to `log_statement` and `should_log_message` to `should_log_statement` in `Logger`\r\n- Replaced `%(log_level_id)` with `%(log_level_short_code)` in the `PatternFormatter`.\r\n\r\n- Fix a `CMakeLists` error for old `CMake` versions prior to `3.19`.

Refer\r\n  [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill?tab=readme-ov-file#performance) for updated and detailed benchmarks.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n- **Improved compile times**\r\n\r\nThe library has been restructured to minimize the number of required headers. Refactoring efforts have focused on\r\ndecoupling the frontend from the backend, resulting in reduced dependencies. Accessing the frontend logging functions\r\nnow does not demand inclusion of any backend logic components.\r\n\r\n     \"quill/Backend.h\" - It can be included once to start the backend logging thread, typically in main.cpp \r\n                         or in a wrapper library.\r\n     \r\n     \"quill/Frontend.h\"` - Used to create or obtain a `Logger*` or a `Sink`. It can be included in limited \r\n                           files, since an obtained `Logger*` has pointer stability and can be passed around.\r\n     \r\n     \"quill/Logger.h\", \"quill/LogMacros.h\" - These two files are the only ones needed for logging and will have \r\n                                             to be included in every file that requires logging functionality.\r\n\r\n- **Backend formatting for user-defined and standard library types**\r\n\r\nOne of the significant changes lies in the support for formatting both user-defined and standard library types.\r\nPreviously, the backend thread handled the formatting of these types sent by the frontend. It involved making a copy for\r\nany object passed to the `LOG_` macros as an argument using the copy constructor of a complex type instead of directly\r\nserializing the data to the SPSC queue. While this method facilitated logging copy-constructible user-defined types with\r\nease, it also posed numerous challenges for asynchronous logging:\r\n\r\n- Error-Prone Asynchronous Logging: Copying and formatting user-defined types on the backend thread in an\r\n  asynchronous logging setup could lead to errors. Previous versions attempted to address this issue with type\r\n  trait checks, which incurred additional template instantiations and compile times.\r\n- Uncertainty in Type Verification: It is challenging to confidently verify types, as some trivially copiable\r\n  types, such as `struct A { int* m; }`, could still lead to issues due to potential modifications by the user\r\n  before formatting.\r\n- Hidden Performance Penalties: Logging non-trivially copiable types could introduce hidden cache coherence\r\n  performance penalties due to memory allocations and deallocations across threads. For instance,\r\n  consider `std::vector<int>` passed as a log argument. The vector is emplaced into the SPSC queue by the frontend,\r\n  invoking the copy constructor dynamically allocating memory as the only members copied to SPSC queue\r\n  are `size`, `capacity`, and `data*`. The backend thread reads the object, formats it, and then invokes the destructor,\r\n  which in turn synchronizes the\r\n  freed memory back to the frontend.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, after years of professional use and based on experience, it has been observed that user-defined types\r\nare often logged during program initialization, with fewer occurrences on the hot path where mostly built-in types are\r\nlogged. In such scenarios, the overhead of string formatting on the frontend during initialization is not an issue.\r\n\r\nIn this new version, the use of the copy constructor for emplacing objects in the queue has been abandoned. Only POD\r\ntypes are copied, ensuring that only raw, tangible data is handled without any underlying pointers pointing to other\r\nmemory locations. The only exception to this are the pointers to `Metadata`, `LoggerBase` and `DecodeFunction`\r\nthat are passed internally for each log message. Log arguments sent from the frontend must undergo\r\nserialization beforehand. While this approach resolves the above issues, it does introduce more complexity when\r\ndealing with user-defined or standard library types.\r\n\r\nBuilt-in types and strings are logged by default, with the formatting being offloaded to the backend. Additionally,\r\nthere is built-in support for most standard library types, which can also be directly passed to the logger by\r\nincluding the relevant header from `quill/std`.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation for user-defined types is to format them into strings before passing them to the `LOG_` macros using\r\nyour preferred method. You can find an example of this [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/user_defined_types_logging.cpp).\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to extend the library by providing template specializations to serialize the user-defined types\r\nand offload their formatting to the backend. However, this approach should only be pursued if you cannot tolerate the\r\nformatting overhead in that part of your program. For further guidance, refer to [this example](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/advanced/advanced.cpp).\r\n\r\n- **Header-Only library**\r\n\r\nThe library is now header-only. This change simplifies exporting the library as a C++ module in the future. See\r\n[here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp) on how to build a wrapper static library which includes the backend and will minimise the compile times.\r\n\r\n- **Preprocessor flags moved to template parameters**\r\n\r\nMost preprocessor flags have been moved to template parameters, with only a few remaining as `CMake` options. This\r\nchange simplifies exporting the library as a C++ module in the future.\r\n\r\n- **Renamed Handlers to Sinks**\r\n\r\nTo enhance clarity, handlers have been renamed to sinks.\r\n\r\n- **PatternFormatter moved to Logger**\r\n\r\nThe `PatternFormatter` has been relocated from `Sink` to `Logger`, enabling a logger object to log in a specific\r\nformat. This allows for different formats within the same output file, a feature not previously possible.\r\n\r\n- **Split Configuration**\r\n\r\nThe configuration settings have been divided into `FrontendOptions` and `BackendOptions`.\r\n\r\n- **Refactoring of backend classes**\r\n\r\n`MacroMetadata` and many backend classes have undergone refactoring, resulting in reduced memory requirements.\r\n\r\n- **Improved wide strings handling on Windows**\r\n\r\nThe library now offers significant performance enhancements for handling wide strings on Windows platforms.\r\nIt's important to note that only wide strings containing ASCII characters are supported. Previously, wide strings were\r\nconverted to narrow strings at the frontend, impacting the critical path of the application.\r\nWith this update, the underlying wide char buffer is copied and the conversion to UTF-8 encoding is deferred to\r\nthe backend logging thread. Additionally, this update adds support for logging STL containers consisting of\r\nwide strings\r\n\r\n- **Default logger removal**\r\n\r\nThe default logger, along with the configuration inheritance feature during logger creation, has been removed. Now, when\r\ncreating a new logger instance, configurations such as the `Sink` and log pattern format must be explicitly specified\r\neach time. This simplifies the codebase.\r\n\r\n- **Global logger removal**\r\n\r\nThe static global logger* variable that was initialised during `quill::start()` used to obtain the default logger has\r\nbeen removed. It is possible to add this on the user side. If you require a global logger you can have a look\r\nat [this example](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp)\r\n\r\n- **Removal of printf style formatting support**\r\n\r\nThe support for `printf` style formatting has been removed due to its limited usage and the increased complexity. Users\r\nrequiring this feature should stay on `v3.x.x` versions to maintain compatibility.\r\n\r\n- **Removal of external libfmt usage**\r\n\r\nThe option to build the library with external `libfmt` has been removed. It becomes difficult to maintain and backwards\r\nsupport previous versions of `libfmt`. Instead, `libfmt` is now an internal component of the library, accessible under\r\nthe namespace `fmtquill`. You can use the bundled version of `fmtquill` by including the necessary headers from\r\n`quill/bundled/fmt`. Alternatively, you have the freedom to integrate your own version. Since `libfmt` is encapsulated\r\nwithin a distinct namespace, there are no conflicts even if you link your own `libfmt` alongside the logging library.\r\n\r\n#### Migration Guidance\r\n\r\n- Revise include files to accommodate the removal of `Quill.h`\r\n- Update the code that starts the backend thread and the logger/sink creation. You can refer to any of the\r\n  updated examples, such as [this one](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/file_logging.cpp)\r\n- When logging statements involving user-defined types, make sure these types are formatted into strings using\r\n  your preferred method. Refer to [this link](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/user_defined_types_logging.cpp) for guidance. Alternatively, if you prefer delaying the conversion to strings until the backend thread and only passing a binary copy of the user-defined type on the hot path, you can provide the necessary class template specializations for each user-defined type.

Previously, the timestamp was taken after checking if the queue had enough space to push the message, which could make it less accurate. Additionally, in the case of a blocking queue, the timestamp could be later in time. Now, the timestamp is taken and stored right after the log statement is issued, before checking for the queue size.\r\n- Reduced template instantiations during logging operations on the hot path. Fold expressions are now used for encoding/decoding arguments, minimizing template recursion overhead.\r\n- Removed compile-time format checks due to their significant impact on template instantiations, especially considering that only a few cases are invalid. For instance, while `fmt::format(\"{}\", 1, 2)` is considered valid, `fmt::format(\"{} {}\", 1)` is deemed invalid. In cases where an invalid format string is detected, the backend worker thread catches the generated exception and logs an error.\r\n- The throughput of the backend worker thread has been improved by approximately 5%.\r\n- Detect `tmux` as colour terminal.

([#353](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/353))\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n      union\r\n    {\r\n      char no_0[2];\r\n      char mid_0[6]{'1', '2', '3', '4', '\\0', 6};\r\n    } char_arrays;\r\n\r\n    // only output \"12\" even if there's no '\\0' at the end\r\n    LOG_INFO(logger, R\"(This is a log info example for char array without '\\0': {})\", char_arrays.no_0);\r\n\r\n    // output \"1234\" until the '\\0'\r\n    LOG_INFO(logger, R\"(This is a log info example for char array with '\\0' in middle: {})\",\r\n             char_arrays.mid_0);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Minor improvements in `BoundedQueue` and `UnboundedQueue` . Throughput is slightly improved.\r\n  Previous: 2.21 million msgs/sec average, total time elapsed: 1809 ms for 4000000 log messages.\r\n  New:      2.24 million msgs/sec average, total time elapsed: 1787 ms for 4000000 log messages.\r\n\r\n- Disable `fmt::join(data, \"\")` at compile time.

This\r\n  function proves helpful when you want to retrieve a handler and pass it to a new logger.\r\n\r\n- Fix build failure of Intel Compiler Classic. ([#332](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/332))\r\n\r\n- Introduced `QUILL_BLOCKING_QUEUE_RETRY_INTERVAL_NS` option for user-configurable retry interval in the blocking queue.\r\n  Default value is 800 nanoseconds. ([#330](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/330))\r\n\r\n- Improved backend thread handling. Now verifies that all producer SPSC queues are empty before entering `sleep`.\r\n\r\n- Fixed a race condition and potential crash in `quill::remove_logger(Logger*)` when called without prior `quill::flush()`.\r\n\r\n- Added protection to prevent removal of the root logger with `quill::remove_logger(Logger*)`.\r\n\r\n- Improved exception handling on the backend thread when calling `fmt::format()`.\r\n\r\n  While compile-time checks ensure that the format string and arguments match, runtime errors can still occur.\r\n  Previously, such exceptions would affect and drop subsequent log records. Now, exceptions are caught and logged\r\n  in the log file and reported via the backend thread notification handler (default is `cerr`).\r\n\r\n  For example, if a dynamic precision is used (`LOG_INFO(logger, \"Support for floats {:.{}f}\", 1.23456, 3.321312)`),\r\n  the log file will show the following error message:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  LOG_INFO root [format: \"Support for floats {:.{}f}\", error: \"precision is not integer\"]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Additionally, an error message will be printed to `cerr`\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  Quill ERROR: [format: \"Support for floats {:.{}f}\", error: \"precision is not integer\"]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug in timestamp formatting that occasionally displayed an hour component of 0 as\r\n  24. ([#329](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/329))\r\n\r\n- Added support for specifying a runtime log level, allowing dynamic log level configuration at runtime.\r\n  The new runtime log level feature provides flexibility when needed, with a minor overhead cost.\r\n  It is recommended to continue using the existing static log level macros for optimal\r\n  performance. ([#321](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/321))\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    std::array<quill::LogLevel, 4> const runtime_log_levels = {quill::LogLevel::Debug,\r\n                                                               quill::LogLevel::Info,\r\n                                                               quill::LogLevel::Warning,\r\n                                                               quill::LogLevel::Error};\r\n  \r\n    for (auto const& log_level : runtime_log_levels)\r\n    {\r\n      LOG_DYNAMIC(logger, log_level, \"Runtime {} {}\", \"log\", \"level\");\r\n    }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Added support for printf-style formatting with `_CFORMAT` macros. These macros use the `printf` format string syntax,\r\n  simplifying the migration of legacy codebases using `printf` statements.\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    std::array<uint32_t, 4> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};\r\n    LOG_INFO(logger, \"This is a log info example using fmt format {}\", arr);\r\n    \r\n    LOG_INFO_CFORMAT(logger, \"printf style %s supported %d %f\", \"also\", 5, 2.32);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Added a `metadata()` member function to the `TransitEvent` class. It provides access to the `Metadata` object\r\n  associated with the log record, simplifying syntax for retrieving log record metadata in custom Handlers.\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  void CustomHandler::write(fmt_buffer_t const& formatted_log_message, quill::TransitEvent const& log_event)\r\n  {\r\n    MacroMetadata const macro_metadata = log_event.metadata();\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Simplified file handler configuration. Now, instead of passing multiple arguments to the constructor,\r\n  you only need to provide a single `FileHandlerConfig` object. This change makes creating file handlers objects\r\n  much easier and more flexible.\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  quill::FileHandlerConfig file_handler_cfg;\r\n  file_handler_cfg.set_open_mode('w');\r\n  file_handler_cfg.set_append_to_filename(quill::FilenameAppend::StartDateTime);\r\n  \r\n  std::shared_ptr<quill::Handler> file_handler = quill::file_handler(\"application.log\", file_handler_cfg);\r\n  quill::Logger* logger_foo = quill::create_logger(\"my_logger\", std::move(file_handler));\r\n  \r\n  LOG_INFO(my_logger, \"Hello from {}\", \"application\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Combined the functionalities of `RotatingFileHandler` (rotating based on file size) and `TimeRotatingFileHandler`\r\n  (rotating on a time interval) into a single, more versatile `RotatingFileHandler`. Users can now conveniently rotate\r\n  logs based on both file size and time intervals simultaneously. The updated `RotatingFileHandler` offers a variety of\r\n  customization options for improved flexibility. For more information on available configurations,\r\n  refer to the `RotatingFileHandlerConfig` documentation.\r\n\r\n  For example\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    // Create a rotating file handler which rotates daily at 18:30 or when the file size reaches 2GB\r\n  std::shared_ptr<quill::Handler> file_handler =\r\n    quill::rotating_file_handler(filename,\r\n                                 []()\r\n                                 {\r\n                                   quill::RotatingFileHandlerConfig cfg;\r\n                                   cfg.set_rotation_time_daily(\"18:30\");\r\n                                   cfg.set_rotation_max_file_size(2'000'000'000);\r\n                                   return cfg;\r\n                                 }());\r\n\r\n  // Create a logger using this handler\r\n  quill::Logger* logger_bar = quill::create_logger(\"daily_logger\", std::move(file_handler));\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Improved compatibility with older versions of external `libfmt`. Quill now compiles for all versions\r\n  of `libfmt >= 8.0.0`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/114084444/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/113391496","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/113391496/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/113391496/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v2.0.3","id":113391496,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4GwjeI","tag_name":"v2.0.3","target_commitish":"branch_2.0.3","name":"v2.0.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-07-24T21:41:03Z","published_at":"2023-07-24T21:44:01Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v2.0.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v2.0.3","body":"This is an older release with the timestamp formatting fix https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/329 for a specific user.\r\nPlease do not use this release and use the latest versions instead","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/113391496/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/111555319","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/111555319/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/111555319/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v3.2.0","id":111555319,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4GpjL3","tag_name":"v3.2.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v3.2.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-07-09T00:57:40Z","published_at":"2023-07-10T00:07:59Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v3.2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v3.2.0","body":"- Addition of `std::is_trivially_copyable<T>` to default copy loggable types.
