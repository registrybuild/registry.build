New Features\r\n\r\n- There is a new macro-free mode that allows logging without macros. You have two options: either `#include \"quill/LogMacros.h\"` or `#include \"quill/LogFunctions.h\"`. The macro mode still remains the recommended and main method for logging. The new macro-free log has higher overhead than using macros. To use the macro-free mode, for example:\r\n\r\n  ```cpp\r\n  quill::debug(logger, \"A {} message with number {}\", \"test\", 123);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  See macro-free mode documentation [here](https://quillcpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/macro_free_mode.html) for details.\r\n\r\n- Added `BinaryDataDeferredFormatCodec` for efficient binary data logging. This codec allows efficient logging of variable-sized binary data by copying the raw bytes on the hot path and deferring the formatting to the backend thread. This is particularly useful for logging binary protocol messages (like SBE or custom binary formats), network packets, and raw binary data without impacting application performance. See the example [sbe_logging](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/sbe_binary_data/sbe_logging.cpp) and [binary_protocol_logging](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/binary_protocol_logging.cpp) for details. For documentation, see [here](https://quillcpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary_protocols.html).\r\n\r\n- The immediate flush feature has been enhanced to support interval-based flushing and moved to runtime. This feature helps with debugging by ensuring log statements are flushed to the sink, blocking the caller thread. ([#660](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/660))\r\n\r\n- Added the `QUILL_DISABLE_FILE_INFO` preprocessor flag and CMake option. This disables `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` information in log statements at compile time when location-related patterns (`%(file_name)`, `%(line_number)`, `%(short_source_location)`, `%(source_location)`) are not needed in the `PatternFormatter`. This removes embedded source path strings from built binaries from the security viewpoint.\r\n\r\n- Added the `QUILL_DETAILED_FUNCTION_NAME` CMake option. When enabled, this option uses compiler-specific detailed function signatures (such as `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__` on GCC/Clang or `__FUNCSIG__` on MSVC) instead of the standard `__FUNCTION__` in log macros. This provides more complete function information, including return types, namespaces, and parameter types. This option is only relevant when `%(caller_function)` is used in the pattern formatter. ([#785](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/785))\r\n\r\n- Added `source_location_path_strip_prefix` option in `PatternFormatterOptions` to customize the display of the `%(source_location)` attribute of `PatternFormatter`. When set, any paths that contain this prefix will have the prefix and everything before it stripped from the displayed path. For example, with prefix \"projects\", a source location like \"/home/user/projects/app/main.cpp:5\" would be displayed as \"app/main.cpp:5\". ([#772](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/772))\r\n\r\n- Added `source_location_remove_relative_paths` option in `PatternFormatterOptions` to remove relative path components from the `%(source_location)` attribute of `PatternFormatter`. When enabled, relative path components like \"../\" are processed and removed, simplifying paths from `__FILE__` which might contain relative paths like \"../../../test/main.cpp\". ([#778](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/778))\r\n\r\n- Added `process_function_name` customisation point in `PatternFormatterOptions`. This function allows custom processing of the function signature before it's displayed in logs. This makes more sense to use when `QUILL_DETAILED_FUNCTION_NAME` is used. This provides flexibility to trim, format, or otherwise modify function signatures to improve readability in log output when using the `%(caller_function)` pattern. ([#785](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/785))\r\n\r\n- Added helper macros for easy logging of user-defined types. Two new macros are available in `quill/HelperMacros.h`:\r\n  - `QUILL_LOGGABLE_DIRECT_FORMAT(Type)`: For types that contain pointers or have lifetime dependencies\r\n  - `QUILL_LOGGABLE_DEFERRED_FORMAT(Type)`: For types that only contain value types and are safe to copy\r\n\r\n  Note that these macros require you to provide either an `operator<<` for your type and they are just shortcuts to existing functionality. ([#777](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/777))\r\n\r\n  Example usage:\r\n  ```cpp\r\n  class User { /* ... */ };\r\n  std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, User const& user) { /* ... */ }\r\n  \r\n  // For types with pointers - will format immediately\r\n  QUILL_LOGGABLE_DIRECT_FORMAT(User)\r\n  \r\n  class Product { /* ... */ };\r\n  std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, Product const& product) { /* ... */ }\r\n  \r\n  // For types with only value members - can format asynchronously\r\n  QUILL_LOGGABLE_DEFERRED_FORMAT(Product)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Internally, refactored how runtime metadata are handled for more flexibility, providing three macros for logging with runtime metadata:\r\n  - `QUILL_LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA_DEEP` - Takes a deep copy of `fmt`, `file`, `function` and `tags`. Most flexible\r\n    option, useful for forwarding logs from another logging library.\r\n  - `QUILL_LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA_HYBRID` - Will take a deep copy of `fmt` and `tags` and will take `file` and\r\n    `function` as reference. This is used for the new macro-free mode.\r\n  - `QUILL_LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA_SHALLOW` - Will take everything as reference. This is used when logging with\r\n    compile-time metadata and using, for example, a dynamic log-level such as `LOG_DYNAMIC`.\r\n\r\n- When using a sink with overridden `PatternFormatterOptions`, the option `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` will now be correctly applied at the Sink level. Previously, this option was only available and effective at the Logger level `PatternFormatter`.\r\n\r\n- When a Sink with override `PatternFormatterOptions` is used and if no other sink exists using the `Logger` `PatternFormatterOptions`, then the backend thread will no longer perform a redundant format log statement.\r\n\r\n- When using a sink with overridden `PatternFormatterOptions`, the `log_statement` that is passed to the `Filter::filter()` will now be formatted based on the overridden options instead of using the `Logger` `PatternFormatterOptions`.\r\n\r\n- Update bundled `libfmt` to `v11.2.0`\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\n- If you were previously setting `QUILL_ENABLE_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` to `1`, this functionality has been moved to runtime with more flexibility. Instead of using a boolean flag, you can now specify the flush interval by calling `logger->set_immediate_flush(flush_every_n_messages)` on each logger instance. Set it to `1` for per-message flushing, or to a higher value to flush after that many messages. Setting it to `0` disables flushing which is the default behaviour. `QUILL_ENABLE_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` still exists as a compile-time preprocessor flag and is set to `1` by default. Setting `QUILL_ENABLE_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH 0` in the preprocessor will eliminate the `if` branch from the hot path and disable this feature entirely, regardless of the value passed to `set_immediate_flush(flush_every_n_messages)`.\r\n\r\n- The `QUILL_LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA` macro requires `file`, `function` and `fmt` to be passed as `char const*` and `line_number` as `uint32_t`. This is a breaking change from the previous version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/223882468/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":10,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/220532466","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/220532466/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/220532466/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v9.0.3","id":220532466,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4NJQ7y","tag_name":"v9.0.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"v9.0.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-05-23T02:38:45Z","published_at":"2025-05-23T02:40:38Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/assets/257312047","id":257312047,"node_id":"RA_kwDODfWAZs4PVkUv","name":"quill-9.0.3.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":3010264,"digest":null,"download_count":31,"created_at":"2025-05-23T02:40:56Z","updated_at":"2025-05-23T02:40:57Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/download/v9.0.3/quill-9.0.3.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v9.0.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v9.0.3","body":"-

API Changes\r\n\r\n- Replaced the `bool huge_pages_enabled` flag in `FrontendOptions` with `quill::HugePagesPolicy huge_pages_policy` enum, allowing huge page allocation to be attempted with a fallback to normal pages if unavailable. If you are using a custom `FrontendOptions` type, you will need to update it to use the new flag. ([#707](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/707))\r\n- Previously, `QueueType::UnboundedDropping` and `QueueType::UnboundedBlocking` could grow up to 2 GB in size. This limit is now configurable via `FrontendOptions::unbounded_queue_max_capacity`, which defaults to 2 GB.\r\n- `QueueType::UnboundedUnlimited` has been removed, as the same behavior can now be achieved by setting `FrontendOptions::unbounded_queue_max_capacity` to the maximum value.\r\n- The `ConsoleSink` constructor now optionally accepts a `ConsoleSinkConfig`, similar to other sinks. If no `ConsoleSinkConfig` is provided, a default one is used, logging to `stdout` with `ColourMode::Automatic`. For example:\r\n    ```c++\r\n    Frontend::create_or_get_sink<ConsoleSink>(\"console_sink\",\r\n                                              []()\r\n                                              {\r\n                                                ConsoleSinkConfig config;\r\n                                                config.set_colour_mode(ConsoleSinkConfig::ColourMode::Never);\r\n                                                config.set_stream(\"stderr\");\r\n                                                return config;\r\n                                              }());\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- The default log level for each `Logger` can now be configured using the environment variable `QUILL_LOG_LEVEL`. Supported values: `\"tracel3\"`, `\"tracel2\"`, `\"tracel1\"`, `\"debug\"`, `\"info\"`, `\"notice\"`, `\"warning\"`, `\"error\"`, `\"critical\"`, `\"none\"`. When set, the logger is initialized with the corresponding log level. If `logger->set_log_level(level)` is explicitly called in code, it will override the log level set via the environment variable.\r\n- Added the `LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA(logger, log_level, file, line_number, function, fmt, ...)` macro. This enables passing runtime metadata (such as file, line number, and function) along with a log message, providing greater flexibility when forwarding logs from other logging libraries. ([#696](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/696))\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA(logger, quill::LogLevel::Info, \"main.cpp\", 20, \"foo()\", \"Hello number {}\", 8);\r\n    ```\r\n- Added a runtime check to detect duplicate backend worker threads caused by inconsistent linkage (e.g., mixing static and shared libraries). If needed, this check can be disabled using the   `check_backend_singleton_instance` flag in `BackendOptions`. ([#687](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/687#discussioncomment-12349621))\r\n- Added the `QUILL_DISABLE_FUNCTION_NAME` preprocessor flag and CMake option. This allows disabling `__FUNCTION__` in `LOG_*` macros when `%(caller_function)` is not used in `PatternFormatter`, eliminating Clang-Tidy warnings when logging inside lambdas.\r\n- It is now possible to override a logger's `PatternFormatter` on a per-sink basis. This allows the same logger to output different formats for different sinks. Previously, achieving this required creating a custom sink type, but this functionality is now built-in. See the example: [sink_formatter_override](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/sink_formatter_override.cpp).\r\n- Added `Frontend::remove_logger_blocking(...)`, which blocks the caller thread until the specified logger is fully removed.\r\n- Added `Frontend::shrink_thread_local_queue(capacity)` and `Frontend::get_thread_local_queue_capacity()`. These functions allow dynamic management of thread-local SPSC queues when using an unbounded queue configuration. They enable on-demand shrinking of a queue that has grown due to bursty logging, helping to reduce memory usage, although in typical scenarios they won't be required.\r\n- Added the `SyslogSink`, which logs messages to the system's syslog.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::SyslogSink>(\r\n      \"app\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::SyslogSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_identifier(\"app\");\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```\r\n- Added the `SystemdSink`, which logs messages to systemd.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::SystemdSink>(\r\n      \"app\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::SystemdSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_identifier(\"app\");\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```  \r\n- Added the `AndroidSink`, which integrates with Android's logging system.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::AndroidSink>(\r\n      \"s1\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::AndroidSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_tag(\"app\");\r\n        config.set_format_message(true);\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Updated bundled `libfmt` to `11.1.4`.\r\n- When `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` in the `PatternFormatter` was set to false, fixed a bug where the last character of the log message was dropped and added protection for empty messages.\r\n- Updated `LOG_EVERY_N` macros to log on the first occurrence (0th call) instead of waiting until the Nth call.\r\n- Added a `nullptr` check for `char*` and `const char*` during encoding, ensuring the library handles `nullptr` values gracefully ([#735](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/735))\r\n- The `CsvWriter` could previously be used with `RotatingFileSink` via the constructor that accepted `std::shared_ptr<Sink>`, but rotated files did not include the CSV header. This has now been improved—when using the new constructor that accepts `quill::RotatingFileSinkConfig`, the CSV header is written at the start of each new rotated file. ([#700](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/700))\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    quill::RotatingFileSinkConfig sink_config;\r\n    sink_config.set_open_mode('w');\r\n    sink_config.set_filename_append_option(FilenameAppendOption::None);\r\n    sink_config.set_rotation_max_file_size(512);\r\n    sink_config.set_rotation_naming_scheme(RotatingFileSinkConfig::RotationNamingScheme::Index);\r\n    \r\n    quill::CsvWriter<OrderCsvSchema, quill::FrontendOptions> csv_writer{\"orders.csv\", sink_config};\r\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < 40; ++i)\r\n    {\r\n      csv_writer.append_row(132121122 + i, \"AAPL\", i, 100.1, \"BUY\");\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n- When using `CsvWriter` with `open_mode == 'a'`, the header will no longer be rewritten if the file already exists.\r\n- On Linux, setting a long backend thread name now truncates it instead of failing. ([#691](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/691))\r\n- Fixed BSD builds. ([#688](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/688))\r\n- Added adaptive termination for stable measurements in `rdtsc` calibration during init\r\n- Fixed `QUILL_ATTRIBUTE_HOT` and `QUILL_ATTRIBUTE_COLD` clang detection\r\n- CMake improvements: switched to range syntax for minimum required version and bumped minimum required CMake version to `3.12`. ([#686](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/686))\r\n- Correct the installation location of pkg-config files. They are now properly placed in `/usr/local/lib`. ([#715](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/715))\r\n- Removed deprecated `TriviallyCopyableTypeCodec`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/209725356/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/201847452","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/201847452/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/201847452/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v8.2.0","id":201847452,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4MB_Kc","tag_name":"v8.2.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v8.2.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-02-22T14:17:41Z","published_at":"2025-02-22T14:19:11Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/assets/231586909","id":231586909,"node_id":"RA_kwDODfWAZs4Nzbxd","name":"quill-8.2.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":2989005,"digest":null,"download_count":368,"created_at":"2025-02-22T14:19:25Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T14:19:26Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/download/v8.2.0/quill-8.2.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v8.2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v8.2.0","body":"- Added `DeferredFormatCodec` and `DirectFormatCodec` for easier logging of user-defined types and smoother migration from pre-`v4` versions. Previously, users had to define a custom `Codec` for every non-trivially copyable user-defined type they wanted to log.\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  template <>\r\n  struct quill::Codec<UserTypeA> : quill::DeferredFormatCodec<UserTypeA>\r\n  {\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  template <>\r\n  struct quill::Codec<UserTypeB> : quill::DirectFormatCodec<UserTypeB>\r\n  {\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  - `DeferredFormatCodec` now supports both trivially and non-trivially copyable types:\r\n    - For trivially copyable types, it behaves the same as `TriviallyCopyableTypeCodec`.\r\n    - For non-trivially copyable types, it works similarly to pre-`v4` by taking a copy of the object using the copy constructor and placement new.\r\n  - `DirectFormatCodec` formats the object immediately in the hot path, serving as a shortcut to explicitly formatting the object when logging.\r\n  - For advanced use cases, a custom `Codec` can still be defined for finer control over

Please rename it to `FileSinkConfig`, which retains the same API and is fully compatible.\r\n- Added `RotatingJsonFileSink`. Functions like `RotatingFileSink`, but specifically designed for rotating JSON log files. ([#637](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/637))\r\n- Simplified `ConsoleSink` by applying ANSI colour codes universally across all platforms, including Windows. The previous Windows-specific implementation has been removed. Note that `quill::ConsoleColours` has been replaced with `quill::ConsoleSink::Colours`, and `quill::ConsoleColours::ColourMode` has been renamed to `quill::ConsoleSink::ColourMode`.\r\n- Changed class member visibility in `FileSink`, `JsonSink`, and `RotatingSink` from private to protected, enabling easier customization through inheritance for user-defined implementations.\r\n- Added a new `sink_min_flush_interval` option in `BackendOptions`, which specifies the minimum time interval (in milliseconds) before the backend thread flushes the output buffers calling `flush_sink()` for all sinks, with a default value of 200ms; The backend thread ensures sinks aren't flushed more frequently than this interval, while explicit calls to `logger->flush_log()` trigger an immediate flush, and flushing may occur less frequently if the backend thread is busy, with this setting applying globally to all sinks. Setting this value to 0 disables the feature. ([#641](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/641))\r\n- Added a `StopWatch` utility for easy logging of elapsed time. It can log the time elapsed since construction in various formats.

The frontend will no longer include `windows.h`. By following the recommended usage example provided [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp) as guidance, you can create a wrapper library around Quill for the backend, allowing you to log on Windows without including `windows.h` in the frontend or main program.

Fixes:**\r\n\r\n- Fixed compile error in `BackendTscClock` ([#577](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/577))\r\n- Added a missing header include in `TriviallyCopyableCodec.h`. ([#560](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/560))\r\n- Fixed incorrect log level short codes introduced in v7 after adding the new log level `NOTICE`. Using `%(log_level_short_code)` in the pattern formatter could incorrectly map `LOG_ERROR` to `\"C\"` and LOG_WARNING to `\"E\"`. ([#564](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/564))\r\n- Fixed an overflow issue when logging more than `uint32_t::max()` bytes in a single log message. For example, attempting to log `std::string s(std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max(), 'a');` would previously cause a crash.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n\r\n- Optimised dynamic log level handling and size calculation for fundamental types, `std::string` and `std::string_view` on the hot path.\r\n- Several enhancements to the backend worker thread, resulting in an overall 10% backend throughput increase. Key optimizations include the simplification of `TransitEventBuffer`, reducing the memory footprint of `TransitEvent`, introducing support for custom buffer sizes in file streams and tuning `transit_events_soft_limit` and `transit_events_hard_limit` default values\r\n- Improved readability of queue allocation notification messages. Capacities are now displayed in KiB, e.g., `20:59:25 Quill INFO: Allocated a new SPSC queue with a capacity of 1024 KB (previously 512 KB) from thread 31158`.\r\n\r\n**New Features:**\r\n\r\n- Introduced support for custom buffer sizes in file streams for `FileSink` and `RotatingFileSink`. Buffer size is now configurable via `FileSinkConfig::set_write_buffer_size(size_value)` with a default of 64 KB.\r\n- Added an optional `fsync` interval to control the minimum time between consecutive `fsync` calls, reducing disk wear from frequent fsync operations. This option is only applicable when `fsync` is enabled. ([#557](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/557))\r\n- Implemented support for appending a custom timestamp format to log filenames via `StartCustomTimestampFormat`.\r\n  Example usage:\r\n  ```cpp\r\n  auto file_sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::FileSink>(\"logfile.log\", []()\r\n  {\r\n    quill::FileSinkConfig cfg;\r\n    cfg.set_filename_append_option(quill::FilenameAppendOption::StartCustomTimestampFormat, \"%m%d\");\r\n    return cfg;\r\n  }());\r\n  ```\r\n  This will create a log file named `logfile0919.log`, where `0919` represents the month and day.\r\n- When using `%(named_args)` in the pattern formatter or logging in JSON format, extra arguments without key names are now included in JSON output with keys corresponding to their positional indexes.

The `Tags` class has been removed. You now pass a `char const*` directly to the macros.\r\n  Additionally, macros previously named `WITH_TAGS` have been renamed to `_TAGS`. For example, `LOG_INFO_WITH_TAGS` is\r\n  now `LOG_INFO_TAGS`.\r\n- Renamed `backend_cpu_affinity` to `cpu_affinity` in `BackendOptions` to improve consistency.\r\n- Simplified project structure by removing the extra quill directory and made minor CMake improvements; `include/quill` is now directly in the root.\r\n- Added support for `std::string` with custom allocator. ([#524](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/524))\r\n- Added a new log level `NOTICE`, for capturing significant events that aren't errors or warnings. It fits between `INFO` and `WARNING` for logging important runtime events that require attention. ([#526](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/526))\r\n- Enhanced static assert error message for unsupported codecs, providing clearer guidance for STL and user-defined types.\r\n- Improved frontend performance by caching the `ThreadContext` pointer in `Logger` class to avoid repeated function calls. On Linux, this is now further optimised with `__thread` for thread-local storage, while other platforms still use `thread_local`.\r\n- Minor performance enhancement in the frontend by replacing `std::vector<size_t>` with an `InlinedVector<uint32_t, 12>` for caching sizes (e.g. string arguments).\r\n- Fixed order of evaluation for `Codec::pair<T1,T2>::compute_encoded_size()` to prevent side effects observed on MSVC\r\n- Introduced the `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` option in `PatternFormatter`. This option, now enabled by default, appends metadata such as timestamps and log levels to every line of multiline log entries, ensuring consistent log output. To restore the previous behavior, set this option to false when creating a `Logger` using `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)`. Note that this option is ignored when logging JSON using named arguments in the format message. ([#534](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/534))\r\n- `JSON` sinks now automatically remove any `\\n` characters from format messages, ensuring the emission of valid `JSON` messages even when `\\n` is present in the format.\r\n- Replaced `static` variables with `static constexpr` in the `ConsoleColours` class.\r\n- Fixed compiler errors in a few rarely used macros. Added a comprehensive test for all macros to prevent similar issues in the future.\r\n- Expanded terminal list for color detection in console applications on Linux\r\n- Fixed an issue where `char*` and `char[]` types could be incorrectly selected by the Codec template in `Array.h`\r\n- The library no longer defines `__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__`, as the bounds-checking functions from the extensions are no longer needed.\r\n- `StringFromTime` constructor no longer relies on the system's current time, improving performance in simulations where timestamps differ from system time. ([#541](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/541))\r\n- The `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)` function now accepts a `PatternFormatterOptions` parameter, simplifying the API. This is a breaking change. To migrate quickly, wrap the existing formatting parameters in a `PatternFormatterOptions` object.\r\n\r\n  **Before:**\r\n  ```c++\r\n    quill::Logger* logger =\r\n      quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger(\"root\", std::move(file_sink),\r\n                                            \"%(time) [%(thread_id)] %(short_source_location:<28) \"\r\n

This bug affected timezones that did not have an exact hour difference from UTC, leading to incorrect timestamp calculations. ([#498](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/498))\r\n- The newline character `\\n` is now considered printable by default and will no longer be sanitized.

Wide string functionality has now been moved to a separate header file, `WideStrings.h`. On Windows, logging wide strings now requires the inclusion of `quill/std/WideStrings.h`.\r\n\r\n- Added `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` preprocessor variable. This variable can be defined before including `LogMacros.h` or passed as a compiler flag. When `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` is defined, the library will flush the log on each log statement. This causes the caller thread to wait for the log to be processed and written to the log file by the backend thread before continuing, significantly impacting performance. This feature is useful for debugging the application when synchronized logs are required. ([#488](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/488))\r\n\r\n- Introduced `log_level_descriptions` and `log_level_short_codes` in `BackendOptions` to allow customization of `LogLevel` descriptions and short codes, replacing previously hardcoded values. This enhancement enables users to define their own descriptions and short codes for each log level. For instance, instead of displaying `LOG_WARNING`, it can now be configured to show `LOG_WARN`.

These new macros simplify logging by automatically printing variable names and values without explicitly specifying each variable name or using `{}` placeholders in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int a = 123;\r\n    double b = 3.17;\r\n    LOGV_INFO(logger, \"A message with two variables\", a, b)\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `A message with two variables [a: 123, b: 3.17]`\r\n\r\n- Introduced `LOGJ_LEVEL`, `LOGJ_LEVEL_LIMIT`, and `LOGJ_LEVEL_WITH_TAGS` macros. These new macros simplify JSON logging by automatically embedding the name of each passed variable as a named argument in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int var_a = 123;\r\n    std::string var_b = \"test\";\r\n    LOGJ_INFO(logger, \"A json message\", var_a, var_b);\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `{\"log_level\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"A json message {var_a}, {var_b}\",\"var_a\":\"123\",\"var_b\":\"test\"}`\r\n\r\n- Enhanced the `filter` function to also receive the formatted `log_message` alongside the log_statement, enabling the comparison and filtering of `log_message` while disregarding elements like timestamps from the full `log_statement`. ([#493](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/493))\r\n\r\n- Renamed `log_message` to `log_statement` and `should_log_message` to `should_log_statement` in `Logger`\r\n- Replaced `%(log_level_id)` with `%(log_level_short_code)` in the `PatternFormatter`.\r\n\r\n- Fix a `CMakeLists` error for old `CMake` versions prior to `3.19`.
