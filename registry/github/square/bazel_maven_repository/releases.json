Inter-artifact dependency detection (only from direct poms, not parents or other inference)\r\n  - Means to override the generated target for an artifact with an alternate build snippet\r\n    * Very useful for swapping out a target for a wrapper target which hooks up an annotation processor.\r\n  - Means to override, per-package, the inferred dependencies and swap them for something else.\r\n    * This is a companion feature to the above build file snippet substitution, since in rewriting the target, it\r\n       is possible to introduce deps cycles or other deps errors, and being able to tweak the dependency \r\n       scanning from poms helps avoid having to do a lot more (and a lot more verbose) snippet replacement.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n  - Dependency metadata inferred from `<dependencyManagement>` and `<properties>` sections of the\r\n     pom.xml files, or inherited from a `<parent>` artifact are not supported, so the tool will make some\r\n     mistakes in scoping and version.  The version errors really only affect error messages, but the scoping\r\n     can result in test artifacts being brought in.  Those artifacts with such inherited/implied deps properties\r\n     can be handled by simple build_substitutes.\r\n  - SNAPSHOT dependencies are still not supported. \r\n\r\nThis release is also the first under the square organization, as the repo has migrated to github.com/square/bazel_maven_repository.
