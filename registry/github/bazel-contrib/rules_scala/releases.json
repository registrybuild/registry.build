release requires bazel 0.2.1.\n\nThe main new features are:\n- add an XML test formatter that writes junit XML results where bazel wants them #24 \n- pass the JAVACMD to scalac so the java environment from bazel is used #19 \n- fix a bug with resources not adding all items #17 \n- deprecate using explicit suites in tests, autodetection of scalatests should work #7\n- support empty srcs to allow scala_library with only exports and runtime_deps #5 \n\nthanks to @johnynek @smparkes @dinowernli and @avibryant for contributions to this release.\n"}]
