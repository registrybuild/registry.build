Breaking changes\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce CPU and memory usage in the analysis phase and to improve the maintainability of the codebase, this release contains a number of breaking changes.\r\nAs the bulk of these changes are to the Go context API, **users of the `go_*` rules should not be affected** (with a very minor exception below).\r\n\r\nThe maintainers would like to give a special thanks to @dzbarsky for numerous contributions to this release!\r\n\r\n## Changes to rules\r\n\r\n- Support for inferring an importpath for libraries named `go_default_library` has been removed. Modern versions of Gazelle do not generate this target name, please ensure you are up to date. ([c8a7ebca3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/c8a7ebca3649e4207994413872c8db1913a02133))\r\n\r\n## Changes to the Go context API and behavior\r\n\r\n- Converted SDK files to depsets (`go.sdk.tools`, `go.sdk.headers`, `go.sdk.libs`, `go.sdk.srcs`). To migrate, either call `to_list()` on those properties or, preferably, use them as `depset`s in your downstream actions. To remain compatible with older versions, consider a conditional conversion such as `depset_or_list if type(depset_or_list) == type([]) else depset_or_list.to_list()` ([3994841a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/3994841ad80c48c06db8ce7d65c8a5cb9840e2d1))\r\n\r\n- `go.sdk_files` has been removed and can be replaced with `depset(direct = [go.sdk.go], transitive = [go.sdk.srcs, go.sdk.headers, go.sdk.libs, go.sdk.tools])` (which is a `depset`). Wherever possible, try to use only the subset of those files that's actually needed.\r\n\r\n- `GoSource` and `GoLibrary` providers have been merged and renamed to `GoInfo`. The previous names are now aliases, but can result in errors about duplicate providers when both are returned from the same rule. `go.new_library` and `go.library_to_source` are now deprecated. To migrate, use `go.new_go_info`. To remain compatible with older versions that require both providers, consider checking whether `GoSource != GoLibrary`. ([564f8204](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/commit/564f82048774e8f18253258eeb4ee6f9874c1909))\r\n\r\n- Some fields on the Go context object are marked deprecated. `go_context` will still add them to the context object, unless it is invoked with `include_deprecated_properties = False`. This default will be flipped in the future and eventually this codepath will be removed. ([aa96a1174](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/aa96a1174a05c45a57875bb47d5b5b0c8f03be0e)) You can migrate as follows:\r\n\r\n    -   `go.root` -> `go.env[\"GOROOT\"]`\r\n    -   `go.go` -> `go.sdk.go`\r\n    -   `go.sdk_root` -> `go.sdk.root_file`\r\n    -   `go.sdk_tools` -> `go.sdk.tools`\r\n    -   `go.package_list` -> `go.sdk.package_list`\r\n    -   `go.tags` -> `go.mode.tags`\r\n    -   `go.stamp` -> `go.mode.stamp`\r\n    -   `go.cover_format` -> `go.mode.cover_format`\r\n    -   `go.pgoprofile` -> `go.mode.pgoprofile`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `get_nogo` from the Go context object ([0f88f8c8](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/0f88f8c82f4d6f60290de1e9164c6f1e53677ed5))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `exe_extension` and `shared_extension` from the Go context object. ([c419453a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/c419453aef92dbed583995719d27ed89c0c345c8))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `GoSource.cc_info`. If you need to access the `CcInfo` from a Go target, you will need to apply the `_go_cc_aspect` from `go/private/rules/binary.bzl`. Please let us know if it's needed and we can move it to public API. ([a01ba7c72](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/a01ba7c725bcbbb37288c997fc7919fb9b7cb89c))\r\n\r\n-   `go_binary` and `go_test` targets no longer expose `GoInfo`, `GoSource` or `GoLibrary` providers. If you need a dedicated provider to attach an aspect to, please let us know. ([2d2266](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/2d22666b0a6eb7f21d97a4681e777c60bcfb778b))\r\n\r\n-   The Go context's `mode` property is now a `GoConfigInfo` provider instead of a bare struct. `go.mode.link` has been renamed to `go.mode.linkmode` ([5933f872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/5933f8727950a7544352105bf5ca4e01732c8f99))\r\n\r\n-   If you are relying on `go_context` to read an `_stdlib` attribute from your `attr`s, please ensure the attribute is not transitioned, as it will no longer handle a list value. ([9214edcd126](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/9214edcd1265665d3ffdfa73a982b8930e96b97f))\r\n \r\n-   `go_context` now accepts keyword arguments for the following fields: `go_context_data`, `importpath`, `importmap`, `embed`, `importpath_aliases`. If these properties are omitted, the function will continue to fall back to reading them from `attr`. Consider passing these explicitly to improve code clarity and analysis phase performance. ([6749a3819](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/6749a3819a00ee5c1ce147a941f6d553629ecb03),

([56d415d](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/56d415d0a774aa7e4679dbcf9d6c1541ed29093f))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `orig_srcs` ([520bee50](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/520bee5039bcaf831ed3e79c513f35f629c04624))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `cgo_exports` ([86c3f3ae97](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/86c3f3ae975a20f78f95922dfe5a01e361fcd56f))\r\n\r\n-   Converted `cover` to a `depset` ([692d008c96](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/692d008c96baf06b02dfebb9551430d71906ca9d))\r\n\r\n-   `deps` is now a list of `GoArchive`s instead of `Target`s ([a32f3e1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/a32f3e18ba26f18e5f9449e7925a194591e2f8dd))\r\n\r\n`GoArchive`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `mode`, use `source.mode` instead ([bfd99a663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/bfd99a663bd518e8fe8eb6f8338bdf3c6e3a507a))\r\n\r\n\r\n`GoArchiveData`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `data_files`, use with `runfiles` instead, which is a `runfiles` object ([60f55c91ce](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/60f55c91ce965d0a334fd21acbcc13673c8f876e))\r\n\r\n\r\n`CgoContextInfo`\r\n\r\n-   Converted `cc_toolchain_files` to a `depset` ([3994841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/3994841ad80c48c06db8ce7d65c8a5cb9840e2d1))\r\n\r\n# `WORKSPACE`

Breaking changes\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce CPU and memory usage in the analysis phase and to improve the maintainability of the codebase, this release contains a number of breaking changes.\r\nAs the bulk of these changes are to the Go context API, **users of the `go_*` rules should not be affected** (with a very minor exception below).\r\n\r\nThe maintainers would like to give a special thanks to @dzbarsky for numerous contributions to this release!\r\n\r\n## Changes to rules\r\n\r\n- Support for inferring an importpath for libraries named `go_default_library` has been removed. Modern versions of Gazelle do not generate this target name, please ensure you are up to date. ([c8a7ebca3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/c8a7ebca3649e4207994413872c8db1913a02133))\r\n\r\n## Changes to the Go context API and behavior\r\n\r\n- Converted SDK files to depsets (`go.sdk.tools`, `go.sdk.headers`, `go.sdk.libs`, `go.sdk.srcs`). To migrate, either call `to_list()` on those properties or, preferably, use them as `depset`s in your downstream actions. To remain compatible with older versions, consider a conditional conversion such as `depset_or_list if type(depset_or_list) == type([]) else depset_or_list.to_list()` ([3994841a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/3994841ad80c48c06db8ce7d65c8a5cb9840e2d1))\r\n\r\n- `go.sdk_files` has been removed and can be replaced with `depset(direct = [go.sdk.go], transitive = [go.sdk.srcs, go.sdk.headers, go.sdk.libs, go.sdk.tools])` (which is a `depset`). Wherever possible, try to use only the subset of those files that's actually needed.\r\n\r\n- `GoSource` and `GoLibrary` providers have been merged and renamed to `GoInfo`. The previous names are now aliases, but can result in errors about duplicate providers when both are returned from the same rule. `go.new_library` and `go.library_to_source` are now deprecated. To migrate, use `go.new_go_info`. To remain compatible with older versions that require both providers, consider checking whether `GoSource != GoLibrary`. ([564f8204](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/commit/564f82048774e8f18253258eeb4ee6f9874c1909))\r\n\r\n- Some fields on the Go context object are marked deprecated. `go_context` will still add them to the context object, unless it is invoked with `include_deprecated_properties = False`. This default will be flipped in the future and eventually this codepath will be removed. ([aa96a1174](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/aa96a1174a05c45a57875bb47d5b5b0c8f03be0e)) You can migrate as follows:\r\n\r\n    -   `go.root` -> `go.env[\"GOROOT\"]`\r\n    -   `go.go` -> `go.sdk.go`\r\n    -   `go.sdk_root` -> `go.sdk.root_file`\r\n    -   `go.sdk_tools` -> `go.sdk.tools`\r\n    -   `go.package_list` -> `go.sdk.package_list`\r\n    -   `go.tags` -> `go.mode.tags`\r\n    -   `go.stamp` -> `go.mode.stamp`\r\n    -   `go.cover_format` -> `go.mode.cover_format`\r\n    -   `go.pgoprofile` -> `go.mode.pgoprofile`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `get_nogo` from the Go context object ([0f88f8c8](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/0f88f8c82f4d6f60290de1e9164c6f1e53677ed5))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `exe_extension` and `shared_extension` from the Go context object. ([c419453a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/c419453aef92dbed583995719d27ed89c0c345c8))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `GoSource.cc_info`. If you need to access the `CcInfo` from a Go target, you will need to apply the `_go_cc_aspect` from `go/private/rules/binary.bzl`. Please let us know if it's needed and we can move it to public API. ([a01ba7c72](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/a01ba7c725bcbbb37288c997fc7919fb9b7cb89c))\r\n\r\n-   `go_binary` and `go_test` targets no longer expose `GoInfo`, `GoSource` or `GoLibrary` providers. If you need a dedicated provider to attach an aspect to, please let us know. ([2d2266](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/2d22666b0a6eb7f21d97a4681e777c60bcfb778b))\r\n\r\n-   The Go context's `mode` property is now a `GoConfigInfo` provider instead of a bare struct. `go.mode.link` has been renamed to `go.mode.linkmode` ([5933f872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/5933f8727950a7544352105bf5ca4e01732c8f99))\r\n\r\n-   If you are relying on `go_context` to read an `_stdlib` attribute from your `attr`s, please ensure the attribute is not transitioned, as it will no longer handle a list value. ([9214edcd126](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/9214edcd1265665d3ffdfa73a982b8930e96b97f))\r\n \r\n-   `go_context` now accepts keyword arguments for the following fields: `go_context_data`, `importpath`, `importmap`, `embed`, `importpath_aliases`. If these properties are omitted, the function will continue to fall back to reading them from `attr`. Consider passing these explicitly to improve code clarity and analysis phase performance.

([56d415d](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/56d415d0a774aa7e4679dbcf9d6c1541ed29093f))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `orig_srcs` ([520bee50](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/520bee5039bcaf831ed3e79c513f35f629c04624))\r\n\r\n-   Removed `cgo_exports` ([86c3f3ae97](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/86c3f3ae975a20f78f95922dfe5a01e361fcd56f))\r\n\r\n-   Converted `cover` to a `depset` ([692d008c96](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/692d008c96baf06b02dfebb9551430d71906ca9d))\r\n\r\n-   `deps` is now a list of `GoArchive`s instead of `Target`s ([a32f3e1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/a32f3e18ba26f18e5f9449e7925a194591e2f8dd))\r\n\r\n`GoArchive`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `mode`, use `source.mode` instead ([bfd99a663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/bfd99a663bd518e8fe8eb6f8338bdf3c6e3a507a))\r\n\r\n\r\n`GoArchiveData`\r\n\r\n-   Removed `data_files`, use with `runfiles` instead, which is a `runfiles` object ([60f55c91ce](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/60f55c91ce965d0a334fd21acbcc13673c8f876e))\r\n\r\n\r\n`CgoContextInfo`\r\n\r\n-   Converted `cc_toolchain_files` to a `depset` ([3994841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/commit/3994841ad80c48c06db8ce7d65c8a5cb9840e2d1))\r\n\r\n## `WORKSPACE`

What's Changed\r\nStarting this release, rules_go no longer ship with `@go_googleapis` repo. Together with Gazelle v0.32.0, it means that all Go code importing generated code from Google APIs will depend on `@org_golang_google_genproto`, which is resolved by Go modules. For proto files importing Google APIs proto and generating Go code, users need to:\r\n\r\n1. Add an `http_archive` rule to download Google APIs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"googleapis\",\r\n    sha256 = \"9d1a930e767c93c825398b8f8692eca3fe353b9aaadedfbcf1fca2282c85df88\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"googleapis-64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/archive/64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@googleapis//:repository_rules.bzl\", \"switched_rules_by_language\")\r\n\r\nswitched_rules_by_language(\r\n    name = \"com_google_googleapis_imports\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of Google APIs archive needs to be compatible with the pre-generated code in `@org_golang_google_genproto`.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve the proto manually. If Gazelle is being used, directives like the following need to be added to a parent directory of the proto files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto proto google/rpc/status.proto @googleapis//google/rpc:status_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/rpc/status.proto  @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/rpc/status\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto google/longrunning/operations.proto @googleapis//google/longrunning:operations_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/longrunning/operations.proto @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/longrunning\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther changes included in this release\r\n\r\n* detect_sdk_version: Support 1.21's new VERSION file format by @evanj in
