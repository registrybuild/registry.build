BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n- Uncompressed archives in the tars attribute is no longer compressed when creating the image, this might make images bigger compared to 1.x. Use pkg_tar#extension or tar#compress attribute to compress the layers beforehand.\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n# For pkg_tar\r\npkg_tar(\r\n  extension = \"tar.gz\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n# For tar\r\ntar(\r\n   compress = \"gzip\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Digests of images created 1.x rules_oci will not match 2.x rules_oci, as we are no longer use `crane` tool to create the images. However, images should stay the same semantically. You can use [diffoci](https://github.com/reproducible-containers/diffoci) to make sure they are the same semantically!\r\n- Default output of  `oci_tarball` is no longer a tarball, use a `filegroup` target to get the tarball.  See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/pull/548\r\n- `oci_tarball` is renamed to `oci_load` to better reflect it's purpose. \r\n- Bazel 5 is no longer supported, and is not tested by the CI, we will not be accepting fixes for it.\r\n- Delimiter for `cmd` and `entrypoint` changed from `,` to `\\n`. See: https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/pull/663\r\n\r\n\r\n## SIGNIFICANT CHANGES\r\n\r\n- `OCIImage` action no longer spins an ephemeral registry instance to mutate images locally, making it slightly faster. See design [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZEB9QFxyrydhLiafYbaJ0D7Jd2FZRZjvoTtx0B8-yY/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n- oci_image now supports `zstd` compression\r\n- Now oci_pull fetches blobs in parallel on `Bazel >= 7.1`\r\n\r\n## API Removals\r\n\r\n- oci_pull no longer has a `config_path` attribute, use `config` attribute instead. It was deprecated in 1.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\r\n\r\n1. Add `common --enable_bzlmod` to `.bazelrc`.\r\n\r\n2. Add to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_oci\", version = \"2.0.0\")\r\n# For testing, we also recommend

Use pkg_tar#extension or tar#compress attribute to compress the layers beforehand.\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n# For pkg_tar\r\npkg_tar(\r\n  extension = \"tar.gz\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n# For tar\r\ntar(\r\n   compress = \"gzip\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Digests of images created 1.x rules_oci will not match 2.x rules_oci, as we are no longer using crane to create the images. However, images should stay the same semantically. You can use [diffoci](https://github.com/reproducible-containers/diffoci) to make sure they are the same semantically! \r\n- Default output of  `oci_tarball` is no longer a tarball, use a `filegroup` target to get the tarball.  See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/pull/548\r\n- `oci_tarball` is renamed to `oci_load` to better reflect it's purpose. \r\n- Bazel 5 is no longer supported, and tested by the CI, we will not be accepting fixes for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## SIGNIFICANT CHANGES\r\n\r\n- OCIImage action no longer spins an ephemeral registry instance to mutate images locally, making it slightly faster.\r\n- oci_image now supports `zstd` compression\r\n- Now oci_pull fetches blobs in parallel on `Bazel >= 7.1`\r\n\r\n## API Removals\r\n\r\n- oci_pull no longer has a `config_path` attribute, use `config` attribute instead. It was deprecated in 1.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/compare/v2.0.0-beta2...v2.0.0-rc0","mentions_count":3},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/169172086","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/169172086/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/169172086/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta2","id":169172086,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOGgrN6M4KFVx2","tag_name":"v2.0.0-beta2","target_commitish":"main","name":"v2.0.0-beta2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-08-07T15:59:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T18:16:42Z","published_at":"2024-08-07T18:16:41Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/assets/184499837","id":184499837,"node_id":"RA_kwDOGgrN6M4K_z59","name":"rules_oci-v2.0.0-beta2.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":87081,"digest":null,"download_count":244949,"created_at":"2024-08-07T18:16:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T18:16:42Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta2/rules_oci-v2.0.0-beta2.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/tarball/v2.0.0-beta2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/zipball/v2.0.0-beta2","body":"## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\n\n1.

BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n- Uncompressed archives in the tars attribute is no longer compressed when creating the image, this might make images bigger compared to 1.x. Use pkg_tar#compression or tar#compress attribute to compress the layers beforehand.\r\n- Digests of images created 1.x rules_oci will not match 2.x rules_oci, as we are no longer using crane to create the images. However, images should stay the same semantically.\r\n- Default output of  `oci_tarball` is no longer a tarball, use a `filegroup` target to get the tarball.  See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/pull/548\r\n- Bazel 5 is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## CHANGES\r\n\r\n- OCIImage action no longer spins an ephemeral registry instance to mutate images locally, making it slightly faster.\r\n- oci_image now supports zstd compression\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\r\n\r\n1.
