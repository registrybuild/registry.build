Changelog\r\n\r\nAfter updating to this release, please repin any of your lock files, as the format of this file has changed slightly. This can be done using `bazel run @unpinned_maven//:pin`. Not repinning isn't an error, but you may see some warnings during the build.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n  * @shs96c added `maven_install.fail_if_repin_required` which optionally allows builds to [fail if the list of maven dependencies has changed](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#requiring-lock-file-repinning-when-the-list-of-artifacts-changes) but the lock file has not been regenerated (#509)\r\n  * @shs96c added a `deploy_env` attribute to `java_export`, which behaves similarly to the one in [java_binary](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.0.0/be/java.html#java_binary.deploy_env) (#534)\r\n  * The `REPIN` environment variable used when repinning deps is also used by other rulesets, such as [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust). @gibfahn added `RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_REPIN` to allow only repinning the java deps (#555)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n  * @dhalperi updated `bazel run @maven//:outdated`, which is used to [list artifacts that could be updated](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#outdated-artifacts), by handling the case where artifact metadata is missing a `release` or `latest` tag (#508)\r\n  * @shs96c added code to generate pseudo-compile jars for downloaded dependencies. This should stop warnings about `bad path element` appearing during compilation (#518)\r\n  * @cheister fixed proxy parsing when the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable doesn't have a scheme (#541) (#542)\r\n  * @sitaktif noted that symlinks don't work well when using a Remote Build Environment. They replace symlinks in `maven_publish`'s `DefaultInfo` (#552)\r\n  * @cheister fixed the `stamp_enabled` flag so it continues to work as expected (#543)\r\n\r\n## Project health\r\n\r\n  * @shs96c made documentation `bzl_library` publicly visible. Rules that depend on `rules_jvm_external` can now be documented with [stardoc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc) (#527)\r\n  * @Bencodes updated jetifier to 1.0.0-beta10 (#548)\r\n  * @illicitonion updated the logic for telling users where to place their lock files (#558)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nIn your WORKSPACE file, add:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nRULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = \"4.1\"\r\nRULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = \"f36441aa876c4f6427bfb2d1f2d723b48e9d930b62662bf723ddfb8fc80f0140\"\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_jvm_external\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_jvm_external-%s\" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,\r\n    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip\" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_jvm_external//:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_jvm_external_deps\")\r\n\r\nrules_jvm_external_deps()\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_jvm_external//:setup.bzl\", \"rules_jvm_external_setup\")\r\n\r\nrules_jvm_external_setup()\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl\", \"maven_install\")\r\n\r\nmaven_install(\r\n    artifacts = [\r\n        \"junit:junit:4.13.2\",\r\n        \"androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1\",\r\n        \"org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library:2.2\",\r\n    ],\r\n    repositories = [\r\n        \"https://maven.google.com\",\r\n        \"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your BUILD file, reference the targets directly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\njava_library(\r\n    name = \"java_test_deps\",\r\n    exports = [\r\n        \"@maven//:junit_junit\",\r\n        \"@maven//:org_hamcrest_hamcrest_library\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nandroid_library(\r\n    name = \"android_test_deps\",\r\n    exports = [\r\n        \"@maven//:junit_junit\",\r\n        \"@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```","mentions_count":7},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/releases/36040295","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/releases/36040295/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/releases/36040295/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/releases/tag/4.0","id":36040295,"author":{"login":"jin","id":347918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin","html_url":"https://github.com/jin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM2MDQwMjk1","tag_name":"4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"4.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-01-06T03:08:16Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T11:29:50Z","published_at":"2021-01-06T11:24:50Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/tarball/4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm_external/zipball/4.0","body":"Project update: we have @cheister joining the project as a co-maintainer!

To use it, run `bazel run @maven//:outdated`. (#465)\r\n- @ablyes added the ability to handle `@` in usernames. (#457)\r\n- @gibfahn added the ability to load MavenPublishInfo from `defs.bzl`. (#440)\r\n- @gibfahn added a provider to `maven_publish` targets to export the information being published for improved interoperability with other rules (#439)\r\n- @divanorama enabled COURSIER_OPTS to be available for the internal coursier invocation (#496)\r\n- @erickj added a `fetch_javadoc` attribute to maven_install to fetch javadoc targets, similar to `fetch_sources` for source jars. (#494) (#495)\r\n- @dmivankov enabled @unpinned_maven//:pin to be always visible regardless of `strict_visibility` in order to be used in run-based rules like `multirun`. (#492)\r\n- @zacharya19 added google cloud storage support to java_export (#463)\r\n- @shs96c introduced an optional `deps` and a `setup` macro to allow rules_jvm_external to pull in its own external dependencies, like for Google Cloud Storage support (#481)\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- @shs96c reworked how maven project jars are calculated to correctly include and exclude classes, in the context of situations like Protobuf dependencies and aspects. See the PR for more information. (#475)\r\n- @cheister fixed `Target-Label` manifest stamping with a custom AddJarManifestEntry class, which maintains consistent timestamps of the jar manifest to make local and remote caching work correctly. \r\n- @dmivankov fixed an issue with correctly computing leading zeroes in `java_export` checksums (#453)\r\n- @alexeagle fixed the path of `jq` in `@maven//:pin` to make it runnable (#454)\r\n- @dmivankov fixed the spelling of the auth scheme as \"Basic\" for Artifactory headers (#452)\r\n- @gibfahn fixed a bug with `tags` in the java_export rule (#444)\r\n- @shs96c fixed an issue with `--frames`, publishing rules on JDK 13 (#460)\r\n\r\n#### Project health\r\n\r\n- @cheister applied a cleanup to use BUILD instead of BUILD.bazel and buildifer these BUILD files (#470)\r\n- @cheister refactored MergeJar to use JarHelper jar entry timestamp logic (#469)\r\n- @jin added a regression test to ensure version intervals keep working.
