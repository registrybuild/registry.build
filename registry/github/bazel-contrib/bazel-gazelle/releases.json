this release, Gazelle no longer resolves Go and proto imports of Google APIs to `@go_googleapis`. Instead, Go packages from Google APIs will be treated as regular Go packages, and resolve to `@org_golang_google_genproto`, which contains the pre-generated Go code, with its version determined by Go modules. For proto files importing Google APIs proto and generating Go code, users need to:\r\n\r\n1. Add an `http_archive` rule to download Google APIs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"googleapis\",\r\n    sha256 = \"9d1a930e767c93c825398b8f8692eca3fe353b9aaadedfbcf1fca2282c85df88\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"googleapis-64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/archive/64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@googleapis//:repository_rules.bzl\", \"switched_rules_by_language\")\r\n\r\nswitched_rules_by_language(\r\n    name = \"com_google_googleapis_imports\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of Google APIs archive needs to be compatible with the pre-generated code in `@org_golang_google_genproto`.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve the proto manually. If Gazelle is being used, directives like the following need to be added to a parent directory of the proto files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto proto google/rpc/status.proto @googleapis//google/rpc:status_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/rpc/status.proto  @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/rpc/status\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto google/longrunning/operations.proto @googleapis//google/longrunning:operations_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/longrunning/operations.proto @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/longrunning\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Decouple Google APIs by @linzhp in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1561\r\n* resolve: Add a resolve_regexp directive by @DolceTriade in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1542\r\n* Remove module dependency on go_googleapis by @linzhp in

Go changes\r\n\r\n  - Introduce static dependency resolution mode which prevents Gazelle from calling out the network. `go_repository` rules now default to this mode, showing [significant performance improvements](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/1190#issuecomment-1069673991) for some repo rules by @blico in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1201\r\n  - `go_repository` rules no longer log Gazelle warnings, unless `debug` mode is explictly set by @blico in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1205\r\n  - Support `canonical_id` attribute for `go_repository` by @kmicklas in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1121\r\n\r\n## Proto changes\r\n\r\n  - Add per-file mode for `proto_library` generation by @wolfd in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1033\r\n  \r\n## General changes\r\n\r\n  - [gazelle_generation_test](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/master/extend.md#gazelle_generation_test) utility for running the gazelle binary on a set of test workspaces by @aptenodytes-forsteri in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1183\r\n  - Introduced `rule.AddAlias` func to support loading aliased symbols by @dorfire in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1127\r\n  - `FixLoad` now generates `load` statements for helper functions by @illicitonion in

Thanks @linzhp.\r\n\r\n## `WORKSPACE` code\r\n\r\n    load(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\n    http_archive(\r\n        name = \"bazel_gazelle\",\r\n        sha256 = \"62ca106be173579c0a167deb23358fdfe71ffa1e4cfdddf5582af26520f1c66f\",\r\n        urls = [\r\n            \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.23.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.23.0.tar.gz\",\r\n            \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.23.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.23.0.tar.gz\",\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    load(\"@bazel_gazelle//:deps.bzl\", \"gazelle_dependencies\")\r\n\r\n    gazelle_dependencies()\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/35672141","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/35672141/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/35672141/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/v0.22.3","id":35672141,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM1NjcyMTQx","tag_name":"v0.22.3","target_commitish":"release-0.22","name":"v0.22.3","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2020-12-23T18:58:38Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T19:09:09Z","published_at":"2020-12-23T19:09:09Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/29922694","id":29922694,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI5OTIyNjk0","name":"bazel-gazelle-v0.22.3.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1596252,"digest":null,"download_count":101094,"created_at":"2020-12-23T19:08:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T19:08:57Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.22.3/bazel-gazelle-v0.22.3.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/tarball/v0.22.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/zipball/v0.22.3","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* `-mode=diff` treats empty build files correctly.

Similarly, a test will be named `foo_test` instead of `go_default_test`.\r\n  * Gazelle will attempt to detect the naming convention used in existing projects, so it shouldn't unexpectedly change the naming convention.\r\n  * To specify the naming convention explicitly, use the `# gazelle:go_naming_convention` directive or the `-go_naming_convention` flag. Valid values are `import`, `go_default_library`, and `import_alias`. Gazelle will rename existing targets the next time it runs after a change.\r\n  * `go_repository` uses the `import_alias` naming convention by default, so either the old or new names may be used.\r\n  * Thanks to @tomlu for implementing this.\r\n* Added `# gazelle:go_generate_proto` directive, which instructs the Go extension whether to generate `go_proto_library` rules for `proto_library` generated by the proto extension (thanks @linzhp).\r\n* Improved Windows compatibility (thanks @tomlu).\r\n* Language extensions can now provide dependency resolution for other extensions by implementing the `resolve.CrossResolver` interface. This is now used for resolve proto imports in Go (thanks @blico).\r\n* In the `update-repos` command, the `-build_directives` flag may be used to set the `build_directives` attribute on generated repositories (thanks @Helcaraxan).\r\n* In the `update-repos` command, new rules and macros will be inserted higher in `WORKSPACE`, above `go_rules_dependencies` and `gazelle_dependencies` if possible, to make it easier to override indirect dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* `gazelle_binary` no longer supports mode attributes such as `goos`, `race`, and `gotags`. These depended on internal implementation details in rules_go. If you need to build a `gazelle_binary` for a platform other than the host, use command-line flags such as `--platforms` and `--@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:race` or use a transition.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE code\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"bazel_gazelle\",\r\n    sha256 = \"d4113967ab451dd4d2d767c3ca5f927fec4b30f3b2c6f8135a2033b9c05a5687\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.22.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.22.0.tar.gz\",\r\n        \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.22.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.22.0.tar.gz\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@bazel_gazelle//:deps.bzl\", \"gazelle_dependencies\")\r\ngazelle_dependencies()\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/v0.21.1","id":26997379,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI2OTk3Mzc5","tag_name":"v0.21.1","target_commitish":"release-0.21","name":"v0.21.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2020-05-28T15:48:00Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T16:37:28Z","published_at":"2020-05-28T16:37:28Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/21147858","id":21147858,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDIxMTQ3ODU4","name":"bazel-gazelle-v0.21.1.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1541328,"digest":null,"download_count":6579730,"created_at":"2020-05-28T15:51:18Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T15:51:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.21.1/bazel-gazelle-v0.21.1.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/tarball/v0.21.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/zipball/v0.21.1","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed visibility for Go libraries in `internal` directories. Previously,\r\n  internal visibility was applied to packages in subdirectories of `internal`,\r\n  directories, not `internal` directories themselves. Thanks to @robfig.\r\n* `go_repository` no longer runs `cat`, and `genrules` are replaced with native\r\n  rules to reduce dependence on msys2 on Windows.
