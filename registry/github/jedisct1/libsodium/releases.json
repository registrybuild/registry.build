point release includes all the changes from 1.0.19-stable, mainly addressing compilation issues and improvements to the .NET packages.\r\n\r\n - Building with `zig build` now requires Zig 0.12.\r\n - When using the traditional build system, -O3 is used instead of -Ofast.\r\n - Improved detection of the compiler flags required on aarch64.\r\n - Improved compatibility with custom build systems on aarch64.\r\n - apple-xcframework: VisionOS packages are not built if Xcode doesn't include that SDK.\r\n - `crypto_kdf_hkdf_sha512_statebytes()` was added.\r\n - When using Visual Studio, runtime CPU feature detection is now enabled on Windows/aarch64.\r\n - There were issues with C++ guards affecting usage of libsodium using Swift on Windows. This has been fixed.\r\n - Emscripten: `crypto_aead_aegis*()` functions are now exported in JavaScript builds\r\n - Emscripten: unsupported `--memory-init-file` option has been removed.\r\n - apple-xcframework: the minimal deployment target can be set to iOS 11+.\r\n - .NET packages now include precompiled libraries for Windows/arm64, iOS, TvOS and Catalyst.\r\n - .NET precompiled libraries now work on any CPUs, using only runtime feature detection.\r\n - SYSV assembly should not be used when targeting Windows (reported by @meiyese, thanks!)\r\n - Compatibility issues with LLVM

release includes all the changes from `1.0.18-stable`, as well as two additions:\r\n\r\n - New AEADs: AEGIS-128L and AEGIS-256 are now available in the `crypto_aead_aegis128l_*()` and `crypto_aead_aegis256_*()` namespaces. AEGIS is a family of authenticated ciphers for high-performance applications, leveraging hardware AES acceleration on `x86_64` and `aarch64`. In addition to performance, AEGIS ciphers have unique properties making them easier and safer to use than AES-GCM. They can also be used as high-performance MACs.\r\n - The HKDF key derivation mechanism, required by many standard protocols, is now available in the `crypto_kdf_hkdf_*()` namespace. It is implemented for the SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions.\r\n - The `osx.sh` build script was renamed to `macos.sh`.\r\n - Support for android-mips was removed.\r\n\r\nFrom 1.0.18-stable:\r\n\r\n - Visual Studio: support for Windows/ARM64 builds has been added.\r\n - Visual Studio: AVX512 implementations are enabled on supported CPUs.\r\n - Visual Studio: an MSVC 2022 solution was added.\r\n - Apple XCFramework: support for VisionOS was added.\r\n - Apple XCFranework: support for Catalyst was added.\r\n - Apple XCFramework: building the simulators is now optional.\r\n - iOS: bitcode is not generated any more, as it was deprecated by Apple.\r\n - watchOS: support for arm64 was added.\r\n - The Zig toolchain can now be used as a modern build system to replace autoconf/automake/libtool/make/ccache and the compiler. This enables faster compilation times, easier cross compilation, and static libraries optimized for any CPU.\r\n - The Zig toolchain is now the recommended way to compile `libsodium` to WebAssembly/WASI(X).\r\n - libsodium can now be added as a dependency to Zig projects.\r\n - Memory fences were added to remove some gadgets that could be used alongside speculative loads.\r\n - The AES-GCM implementation was completely rewritten. It is now faster, and also available on aarch64, including Windows/ARM64.\r\n - Compatibility with CET instrumentation / IBT / Shadow Stack was added.\r\n - Emscripten: the `crypto_pwhash_*()` functions have been removed from Sumo builds, as they reserve a substantial amount of JavaScript memory, even when not used.\r\n - Benchmarks now use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` if possible.\r\n - WebAssembly: tests can now run using Bun, WasmEdge, Wazero, wasm3 and wasmer-js. Support for WAVM and Lucet have been removed, as these projects have reached EOL.\r\n - .NET: the minimum supported macOS version is now 1.0.15; this matches Microsoft guidelines.\r\n - .NET: all the packages are now built using Zig, on all platforms. This allows us to easily match Microsoft's requirements, including supported glibc versions. However, on x86_64, targets are expected to support at least the AVX instruction set.\r\n - .NET: packages for ARM64 are now available.\r\n - C23 `memset_explicit()` is now used, when available.\r\n - Compilation now uses `-Ofast` or `-O3` instead of `-O2` by default.\r\n - Portability improvements to help compile libsodium to modern game consoles.\r\n - JavaScript: a default `unhandledRejection` handler is not set any more.\r\n - Slightly faster 25519 operations.\r\n - OpenBSD: leverage

Special thanks to @facekapow and @pepyakin who helped to make it happen.\r\n - Internal consistency checks failing and primitives used with dangerous/out-of-bounds/invalid parameters used to call abort(3). Now, a custom handler *that doesn't return* can be set with the `set_sodium_misuse()` function. It still aborts by default or if the handler ever returns. This is not a replacement for non-fatal, expected runtime errors. This handler will be only called in unexpected situations due to potential bugs in the library or in language bindings.\r\n - `*_MESSAGEBYTES_MAX` macros (and the corresponding `_messagebytes_max()` symbols) have been added to represent the maximum message size that can be safely handled by a primitive. Language bindings are encouraged to check user inputs against these maximum lengths.\r\n - The test suite has been extended to cover more edge cases.\r\n - `crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519()` now rejects points that are not on the curve, or not in the main subgroup.\r\n - Further changes have been made to ensure that smart compilers will not optimize out code that we don't want to be optimized.\r\n - Visual Studio solutions are now included in distribution tarballs.\r\n - The `sodium_runtime_has_*` symbols for CPU features detection are now defined as weak symbols, i.e. they can be replaced with an application-defined implementation. This can be useful to disable AVX* when temperature/power consumption is a concern.\r\n - `crypto_kx_*()` now aborts if called with no non-NULL pointers to store keys to.\r\n - SSE2 implementations of `crypto_verify_*()` have been added.\r\n - Passwords can be hashed using a specific algorithm with the new `crypto_pwhash_str_alg()` function.\r\n - Due to popular demand, base64 encoding (`sodium_bin2base64()`) and decoding (`sodium_base642bin()`) have been implemented.\r\n - A new `crypto_secretstream_*()` API was added to safely encrypt files and multi-part messages.\r\n - The `sodium_pad()` and `sodium_unpad()` helper functions have been added in order to add & remove padding.\r\n - An AVX512 optimized implementation of Argon2 has been added (written by Ondrej Mosnáček, thanks!)\r\n - The `crypto_pwhash_str_needs_rehash()` function was added to check if a password hash string matches the given parameters, or if it needs an update.\r\n - The library can now be compiled with recent versions of emscripten/binaryen that don't allow multiple variables declarations using a single `var` statement.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/7053299","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/7053299/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/7053299/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/tag/1.0.13","id":7053299,"author":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTcwNTMyOTk=","tag_name":"1.0.13","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.13","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-07-15T15:45:37Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T18:26:18Z","published_at":"2017-07-15T18:26:18Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/assets/4336494","id":4336494,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDQzMzY0OTQ=","name":"libsodium-1.0.13.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1895139,"digest":null,"download_count":357672,"created_at":"2017-07-15T18:24:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T18:25:11Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.13/libsodium-1.0.13.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/assets/4336496","id":4336496,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDQzMzY0OTY=","name":"libsodium-1.0.13.tar.gz.minisig","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":311,"digest":null,"download_count":302,"created_at":"2017-07-15T18:25:35Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T18:25:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.13/libsodium-1.0.13.tar.gz.minisig"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/tarball/1.0.13","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/zipball/1.0.13","body":"- Javascript: the sumo builds now include all symbols.

- Ed25519ph was implemented, adding a multi-part signature API (`crypto_sign_init()`, `crypto_sign_update()`, `crypto_sign_final_*()`).\r\n - New constants and related accessors have been added for Scrypt and Argon2.\r\n - XChaCha20 has been implemented. Like XSalsa20, this construction extends the ChaCha20 cipher to accept a 192-bit nonce. This makes it safe to use ChaCha20 with random nonces.\r\n - `crypto_secretbox`, `crypto_box` and `crypto_aead` now offer variants leveraging XChaCha20.\r\n - SHA-2 is about 20% faster, which also gives a speed boost to signature and signature verification.\r\n - AVX2 implementations of Salsa20 and ChaCha20 have been added. They are twice as fast as the SSE2 implementations. The speed gain is even more significant on Windows, that previously didn't use vectorized implementations.\r\n - New high-level API: `crypto_kdf`, to easily derive one or more subkeys from a master key.\r\n - Siphash with a 128-bit output has been implemented, and is available as `crypto_shorthash_siphashx_*`.\r\n - New `*_keygen()` helpers functions have been added to create secret keys for all constructions. This improves code clarity and can prevent keys from being partially initialized.\r\n - A new `randombytes_buf_deterministic()` function was added to deterministically fill a memory region with pseudorandom data. This function can especially be useful to write reproducible tests.\r\n - A `crypto_kx_*()` API was added to compute shared session keys.\r\n - AVX2 detection is more reliable.\r\n - The pthreads library is not required any more when using MingW.\r\n - `contrib/Findsodium.cmake` was added as an example to include libsodium in a project using cmake.\r\n - Compatibility with gcc 2.x has been restored.\r\n - Minimal builds can be checked using `sodium_library_minimal()`.\r\n - The `--enable-opt` compilation switch has become compatible with more platforms.\r\n - Android builds are now using clang on platforms where it is available.\r\n\r\n![Pie from

`sodium_init()` is now thread-safe, and can be safely called multiple times.\n- Android binaries now properly support 64-bit Android, targeting platform 24, but without breaking compatibility with platforms 16 and 21.\n- Better support for old gcc versions.\n- On FreeBSD, core dumps are disabled on regions allocated with sodium allocation functions.\n- AVX2 detection was fixed, resulting in faster BLAKE2b hashing on platforms where it was not properly  detected.\n- The Sandy2x Curve25519 implementation was not as fast as expected on some platforms. This has been fixed.\n- The NativeClient target was improved. Most notably, it now supports optimized implementations, and uses `pepper_49` by default.\n- The library can be compiled with recent Emscripten versions. Changes have been made to produce smaller code, and the default heap size was reduced in the standard version.\n- The code can now be compiled on SLES11 service pack 4.\n- Decryption functions can now accept a NULL pointer for the output. This checks the MAC without writing the decrypted message.\n- `crypto_generichash_final()` now returns `-1` if called twice.\n- Support for Visual Studio 2008 was improved.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/2949952","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/2949952/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/2949952/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/tag/1.0.10","id":2949952,"author":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI5NDk5NTI=","tag_name":"1.0.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.10","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-04-04T19:55:44Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:34Z","published_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:34Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/assets/1508661","id":1508661,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE1MDg2NjE=","name":"libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1827211,"digest":null,"download_count":978065,"created_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:31Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.10/libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/assets/1508662","id":1508662,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE1MDg2NjI=","name":"libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz.minisig","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jedisct1","id":124872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1","html_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedisct1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":311,"digest":null,"download_count":269,"created_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T20:01:31Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.10/libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz.minisig"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/tarball/1.0.10","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jedisct1/libsodium/zipball/1.0.10","body":"- This release only fixes a compilation issue reported with some older gcc versions.
