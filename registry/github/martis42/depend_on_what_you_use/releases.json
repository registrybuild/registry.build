This should help mitigate many of the performance problems of DWYU in large projects and/or complex CC targets.`\r\n\r\nFurthermore, DWYU offers now a new approach for deducing which header files belong to the toolchain and thus do not require a dedicated dependency, so we can get rid of the manually created hard coded list of headers.\r\n\r\nThose new features are for now opt-in. Please test them and create a bug report if they don't behave as expected. The plan is to make those new things the default in a future release and eventually deprecate the old solutions.\r\nFor details how to activate those new features, see [Noteworthy Changes](#Noteworthy-Changes) below.\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod (Recommended)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\", version = \"0.10.0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE (Legacy)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\",\r\n    sha256 = \"8d552c2b7c8e65e4b7bcf02949f6df7a0fd249f3e475961d360eee98de466e11\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"depend_on_what_you_use-0.10.0\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/releases/download/0.10.0/depend_on_what_you_use-0.10.0.tar.gz\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_1.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_1 = \"setup_step_1\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_1()\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_2.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_2 = \"setup_step_2\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_2()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy Changes\r\n\r\n- First step for the new C++ based implementation. For workspaces with many small CC targets this should offer a significant speed increase. Also workspaces with few or very complex targets still shouldsee a measurable improvement. To use the partly C++ based implementation use the aspect config option `use_cpp_implementation=True`.  For details see https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/397\r\n- Enable automatically discovering the header files provided by your CC toolchain. Those are then ignored during the DWYU analysis, since one does not require a direct dependency for those. For most users this should not change much, as the hard coded list we used until now should already have covered most common cases. This new approach makes this more generic for supporting all kinds of platform and system specific headers as well. For using this new approach - before it becomes the default in a future release - use the aspect config option `ignore_cc_toolchain_headers=True`.  For details see https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/372\r\n- You can now choose different names than `@depend_on_what_you_use` when using DWYU in your stack, see https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/381\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* chore(deps): update pre-commit hook pre-commit/mirrors-mypy to v1.16.0 by @renovate[bot] in

Changes\r\n\r\n- Improved performance while comparing include statements to headers provided by dependencies. Thanks to @arvid-norlander for this contribution! https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/352\r\n- Allow disabling the preprocessor with a new aspect option `experimental_no_preprocessor`. While the preprocessor allows us to handle conditional includes and generally all sorts of preprocessor directives and macros, the implementation we use its quite slow. For projects without manipulation of include statements on preprocessor level this can significantly reduce the time required for the DWYU analysis (up to factor 100 in benchmarks)

Changes\r\n\r\n- Automatic fixes: Change how arguments are forwarded to buildozer. This is done to achieve a consistent API to how arguments are forwarded to the bazel commands. https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/251\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy Changes\r\n\r\n- Analysis: Update standard library headers which are ignored by DWYU https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/248\r\n- Automatic fixes: Support `cquery` to find missing dependencies. Also we allow  now forwarding arguments to the bazel commands which are executed by the apply_fixes script https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/249, https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/252\r\n- Analysis: Fix bug for analyzing implementation_deps when using target mappings https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/254\r\n- Automatic fiixes: Add a new method for discovering DWYU report files which should be more efficient for large workspaces. This is based on creating an execution log for the analysis done by the DWYU aspect and then forwarding this log to the apply_fixes script https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/255\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* chore(deps): update quality tooling dependencies by @renovate in

 This release is a major milestone for DWYU :tada:\r\n\r\nThis is the first release without a leading 0.0. While DWYU is not yet ready for 1.0.0, its overall feature set is now mostly stable. No bug reports with major gaps in functionality have been reported and thus we are confident to leave the \"_beta testing_\" phase.\r\n\r\nThis is also the first release supporting [bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod). Also we added [examples](https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/tree/main/examples) demonstrating DWYU usage.\r\n\r\nPlease note this release has some breaking changes as defined below.\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod (Recommended)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\", version = \"0.1.0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE (Legacy)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\",\r\n    sha256 = \"746de76cb6a8d5e0d6e60c91bcc73ffd6088fff4152552c3e0aee6219c1d809d\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"depend_on_what_you_use-0.1.0\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/releases/download/0.1.0/depend_on_what_you_use-0.1.0.tar.gz\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_1.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_1 = \"setup_step_1\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_1()\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_2.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_2 = \"setup_step_2\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_2()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The **minimum Bazel version is now 5.4.0**\r\n- The output group has been renamed.  Replace `--output_groups=cc_dwyu_output` with `--output_groups=dwyu` in your DWYU commands https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/170\r\n- The name for the DWYU aspect option to provide a config file for ignored include paths changed from `config = \"//<your_config_file>.json\"` to `ignored_includes = \"//<your_config_file>.json\"` https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/181\r\n- Renamed the `--bazel-bin` apply_fixes CLI option to `--search-path` to make it more obvious how flexibly it can be used https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/221\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy Changes\r\n\r\n- Windows and macOS are now explicitly tested in the CI to ensure DWYU behaves on those platforms as
