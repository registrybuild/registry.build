Thanks to @arvid-norlander for this contribution! https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/352\r\n- Allow disabling the preprocessor with a new aspect option `experimental_no_preprocessor`. While the preprocessor allows us to handle conditional includes and generally all sorts of preprocessor directives and macros, the implementation we use its quite slow. For projects without manipulation of include statements on preprocessor level this can significantly reduce the time required for the DWYU analysis (up to factor 100 in benchmarks)

Changes\r\n\r\n- Automatic fixes: Change how arguments are forwarded to buildozer. This is done to achieve a consistent API to how arguments are forwarded to the bazel commands. https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/251\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy Changes\r\n\r\n- Analysis: Update standard library headers which are ignored by DWYU https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/248\r\n- Automatic fixes: Support `cquery` to find missing dependencies. Also we allow  now forwarding arguments to the bazel commands which are executed by the apply_fixes script https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/249, https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/252\r\n- Analysis: Fix bug for analyzing implementation_deps when using target mappings https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/254\r\n- Automatic fiixes: Add a new method for discovering DWYU report files which should be more efficient for large workspaces. This is based on creating an execution log for the analysis done by the DWYU aspect and then forwarding this log to the apply_fixes script https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/255\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* chore(deps): update quality tooling dependencies by @renovate in

 This release is a major milestone for DWYU :tada:\r\n\r\nThis is the first release without a leading 0.0. While DWYU is not yet ready for 1.0.0, its overall feature set is now mostly stable. No bug reports with major gaps in functionality have been reported and thus we are confident to leave the \"_beta testing_\" phase.\r\n\r\nThis is also the first release supporting [bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod). Also we added [examples](https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/tree/main/examples) demonstrating DWYU usage.\r\n\r\nPlease note this release has some breaking changes as defined below.\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod (Recommended)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\", version = \"0.1.0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE (Legacy)\r\n\r\nAdd to your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"depend_on_what_you_use\",\r\n    sha256 = \"746de76cb6a8d5e0d6e60c91bcc73ffd6088fff4152552c3e0aee6219c1d809d\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"depend_on_what_you_use-0.1.0\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/releases/download/0.1.0/depend_on_what_you_use-0.1.0.tar.gz\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_1.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_1 = \"setup_step_1\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_1()\r\n\r\nload(\"@depend_on_what_you_use//:setup_step_2.bzl\", dwyu_setup_step_2 = \"setup_step_2\")\r\ndwyu_setup_step_2()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The **minimum Bazel version is now 5.4.0**\r\n- The output group has been renamed.  Replace `--output_groups=cc_dwyu_output` with `--output_groups=dwyu` in your DWYU commands https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/170\r\n- The name for the DWYU aspect option to provide a config file for ignored include paths changed from `config = \"//<your_config_file>.json\"` to `ignored_includes = \"//<your_config_file>.json\"` https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/181\r\n- Renamed the `--bazel-bin` apply_fixes CLI option to `--search-path` to make it more obvious how flexibly it can be used https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/221\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy Changes\r\n\r\n- Windows and macOS are now explicitly tested in the CI to ensure DWYU behaves on those platforms as expected.\r\n- You can now specify a custom list of tags to make DWYU skip analyzing targets https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/159\r\n- Support depending on DWYU via bzlmod\r\n- Ensure code quality with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (most checks are active)\r\n- There is now a set of [examples](https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/tree/main/examples)\r\n- Add verbosity option to the aspect https://github.com/martis42/depend_on_what_you_use/pull/209\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add missing index entry to new feature by @martis42 in
