for C++11 and newer (#51)\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Change default of span_FEATURE_COMPARISON to 0 (#30)\r\n- Change defaults of span_CONFIG_EXTENT_TYPE, span_CONFIG_SIZE_TYPE to std::size_t (#30)\r\n- Rename as_writeable_bytes() to as_writable_bytes() (#30, thanks to @nolange)\r\n- Rename index_type to size_type, p1872 (#30, thanks to @ThePhD); p1872 - span should have size_type, not index_type\r\n- [skip ci] Improve MSVC version table (nonstd-lite-project issue 38); https://github.com/martinmoene/nonstd-lite-project/issues/38\r\n- Avoid std::equal volatile comparisons for libc++ (#44); libc++ doesn't allow us to perform std::equal on volatile and non-volatile types. We can work around this by iterating over the span and manually comparing.\r\n- Introduce span_CONFIG_EXTENT_TYPE, fix constraint (thanks to @ThePhD)\r\n- Use #include in code on Godbolt (#49)\r\n- Suppress clang's warning -Wmismatched-tags (#50, thanks to @vlovich)\r\n- Skip tuple_element_t test for VS2013 (#51)\r\n- Readme: Add several ISO C++ Committee Trip Reports\r\n- Readme: Point to

structured bindings (#30)\r\n- Provide base templates of tuple_size, tuple_element (#30); also remove && variants of get<>(spn)\r\n- Fix span_HAVE_DEDUCTION_GUIDES for MSVC (#38, thanks to @melak47), Use span_COMPILER_MSVC_VER instead of span_COMPILER_MSVC_VERSION\r\n- Use 'class' for tuple_size, tuple_element (#50, thanks to @vlovich)\r\n- Fix typo in INDEX_TYPE deprecation note; span_CONFIG_INDEX_TYPE was changed to span_CONFIG_SIZE_TYPE in 0c95c299 but due to a typo, this was not described correctly in the README.md\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nonstd-lite/span-lite/releases/20487069","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nonstd-lite/span-lite/releases/20487069/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nonstd-lite/span-lite/releases/20487069/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nonstd-lite/span-lite/releases/tag/v0.6.0","id":20487069,"author":{"login":"flexferrum","id":1494258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTQyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1494258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum","html_url":"https://github.com/flexferrum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexferrum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIwNDg3MDY5","tag_name":"v0.6.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release
