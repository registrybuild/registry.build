release fixes a difference that could arise when building the Spring Boot jar on different platforms (Linux, Mac). Spring Boot loader seems to use the order of insertion into the Spring Boot executable jar as the classloading order at runtime. Therefore we need to be more explicit about the order in which entries are inserted into the Spring Boot executable, and not leave it to the platform implementation of *jar* to determine the order. More details are in Issue #72.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/1.0.8","id":35322873,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM1MzIyODcz","tag_name":"1.0.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.8 December 2020 Features, Features, Features","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-12-15T23:59:37Z","published_at":"2020-12-16T00:22:45Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/29607660","id":29607660,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI5NjA3NjYw","name":"bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.8.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":70892,"download_count":22,"created_at":"2020-12-16T00:15:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T00:15:12Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/1.0.8/bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.8.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/1.0.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/1.0.8","body":"This is a pre-release of the [1.1.0 planned release](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule/projects/4) (coming soon).

This release achieved the following for [duplicate class checking](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule/blob/master/tools/springboot/README.md#duplicate-classes-detection):\r\n\r\n- the output has been improved when it detects a duplicate class and fails\r\n- if you have a [captive python install](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule/tree/master/tools/python_interpreter) in your workspace as a python toolchain, it will use that to run the script instead of system python\r\n- the allowlist.txt file for listing jar files that are excluded from dupe class checking is now configurable per instance of the springboot rule; previously it was embedded in the springboot rule itself\r\n- it now operates entirely in python; previously it was half done in Bash, half in python.\r\n- it executes as a top level subrule within the Spring Boot rule macro; previously it was embedded in the packaging step\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Spring Boot jar rule [now supports the visibility attribute](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule/commit/fc47aaab20d8a7f95e4f95244493bb2e11a47065).

We need to rework the dupe class checker feature for Issue #44, which is scheduled for our current sprint, so we might be able to solve #29 at the same time."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/31728941","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/31728941/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/31728941/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/1.0.2","id":31728941,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTMxNzI4OTQx","tag_name":"1.0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.2 September 2020: cleaned up allowlist feature for dupe checking","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-09-23T22:48:06Z","published_at":"2020-09-23T22:51:22Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/26110810","id":26110810,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI2MTEwODEw","name":"bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.2.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":51110,"download_count":17360,"created_at":"2020-09-23T22:51:07Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T22:51:18Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/1.0.2/bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.2.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/1.0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/1.0.2","body":"Patch release to clean up the allowlist.txt file, which is an input into dupe checking.
