To support this feature, the rule prefixes the generated names in the macro to prevent filename/target collisions. Unfortunately, this broke support for the *git.properties* file in Spring Boot because it loads [the file based on name](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/endpoints.html#actuator.endpoints.info.git-commit-information). With the prefixing, the filename became *mytarget_git.properties* which is ignored by Spring. This release fixes that problem (#259). In addition to fixing the bug, tests were added to detect file packaging problems in the future.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement was recently added to *rules_spring*. It is a new example, and so is not present in the release jar. But it is worth mentioning here that there is now an example for BuildProperties (#113) support in Spring Boot applications.\r\n\r\n**Bzlmod:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_spring\", version = \"2.6.2\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**WORKSPACE:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_spring\",\r\n    sha256 = \"a1305e2283fea77ebe2aa29dd03ffb2ac8c248b9a3d1d7fd28ff6478962dd27b\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/2.6.2/rules-spring-2.6.2.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/193815653/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/192057744","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/192057744/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/192057744/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/2.6.1","id":192057744,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBsP4ss4LcpGQ","tag_name":"2.6.1","target_commitish":"main","name":"2.6.1 Dec 2024 Bug Fixes for Multiarch, JAVABIN, debug","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-12-23T06:24:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T20:02:33Z","published_at":"2024-12-23T06:31:59Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/215297525","id":215297525,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBsP4ss4M1S31","name":"rules-spring-2.6.1.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":112624,"digest":null,"download_count":14448,"created_at":"2024-12-23T06:26:52Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T06:26:52Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/2.6.1/rules-spring-2.6.1.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/2.6.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/2.6.1","body":"**Warning:** this release contains bug https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/issues/259, which is an issue with git.properties support.

Instead of *packagename_apprun*, the target is now *packagename_targetname_apprun*.\r\n\r\nAnd an enhancement, and a bug fix, related to JVM flags used during Bazel run executions of *springboot()* targets:\r\n\r\n- Added new attribute *bazelrun_jvm_flag_list* as the new preferred form of *bazelrun_jvm_flags*. It has the same purpose but is more bazel-like: it is an array of JVM args, instead of a space separated string. *bazelrun_jvm_flags* is now deprecated. #234\r\n- Discovered that *ADD_OPENS* and *ADD_EXPORTS* Bazel run script variables were not working correctly in some cases. There was no delimiter between ADD_OPENS and JVM_FLAGS in the arg list and so in some cases jvm flags were being mistaken for adds. This didn't cause any actual problems because they just get appended together on the command line in the end, but it was messy. I removed those two variables since ADDs can just be specified together as additional JVM_FLAGS in a single list. This will only impact users that have custom launcher scripts - please refresh your launcher script with updates from the default one. #234\r\n\r\n**Bzlmod:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n# rules_spring is not in Bazel Central Registry yet, so use the specific commit\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_spring\", version = \"2.5.2\")\r\ngit_override(\r\n    module_name = \"rules_spring\",\r\n    remote = \"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring\",\r\n    commit=\"9458a305f2978673cdeb26962d38fd0d4f7b7ad7\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**WORKSPACE:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_spring\",\r\n    sha256 = \"e08254a8dac77b1d3f85ada556038605c4106dbf09f92f26a06df511d16e6471\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/2.5.2/rules-spring-2.5.2.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/191960787/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/189872415","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/189872415/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/189872415/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/2.5.1","id":189872415,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBsP4ss4LUTkf","tag_name":"2.5.1","target_commitish":"main","name":"2.5.1 Dec 2024 Bzlmod fix, bazelrun script fixes","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-12-10T05:03:48Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T05:38:40Z","published_at":"2024-12-10T05:12:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/212293058","id":212293058,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBsP4ss4Mp1XC","name":"rules-spring-2.5.1.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":110256,"digest":null,"download_count":11952,"created_at":"2024-12-10T05:10:54Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T05:10:54Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/2.5.1/rules-spring-2.5.1.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/2.5.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/2.5.1","body":"This is a bug fix release:\r\n\r\n- Fixes an error in the Bzlmod MODULE.bazel of 2.5.0 related to the dev dependency *rules_jvm_external* #229 \r\n- Fixes an issue with the bazelrun script, due to the first line being a blank line #143 (@drmercer-lucid)\r\n- Fixes a packaging problem with the bazelrun script when *--nolegacy_external_runfiles* is used #227 (@drmercer-lucid)\r\n- Stood up a [public test repo](https://github.com/plaird/rules_spring_demoapp) for testing *rules_spring* releases; previously we relied on an internal monorepo for all testing.

This replaces the previous default behavior, which was to use `JAVA_HOME`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are two new options for overriding this behavior.  See the [launcher JVM docs](https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/blob/main/springboot/bazelrun.md#launcher-jvm)  for more details.\r\n\r\n**Javax => Jakarta Migration Support**\r\n\r\nThis release includes a new **javax detector** that is not enabled by default.  It detects any jar in the `springboot` dependency graph that contains a class from a *javax* package.  It consults an ignorelist (that you provide) to determine if this is known jar.  If not, it will fail the build.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't heard of the javax -> jakarta migration that is up-ending the Java community, this may seem like a strange feature.  For more information, please see [our new docs](https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/blob/main/springboot/javax.md) on this topic.
