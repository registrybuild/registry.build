The release and prior dev versions have been running in multiple large scale applications for months, and the cumulative improvements are substantial in many cases.\r\n\r\nGiven the long and successful production runs, this release is likely a good candidate for applications to upgrade, from both jemalloc 5.0 and before.  For performance-critical applications, the newly added [TUNING.md](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/blob/dev/TUNING.md) provides guidelines on jemalloc tuning.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Implement transparent huge page support for internal metadata.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add ```opt.thp``` to allow enabling / disabling transparent huge pages for all mappings.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add maximum background thread count option.  (@djwatson)\r\n- Allow ```prof_active``` to control ```opt.lg_prof_interval``` and ```prof.gdump```.  (@interwq)\r\n- Allow arena index lookup based on allocation addresses via mallctl.  (@lionkov)\r\n- Allow disabling initial-exec TLS model.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @KenMacD)\r\n- Add ```opt.lg_extent_max_active_fit``` to set the max ratio between the size of the active extent selected (to split off from) and the size of the requested allocation.  (@interwq, @davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Add ```retain_grow_limit``` to set the max size when growing virtual address space.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add mallctl interfaces:\r\n  + ```arena.<i>.retain_grow_limit```  (@interwq)\r\n  + ```arenas.lookup```  (@lionkov)\r\n  + ```max_background_threads```  (@djwatson)\r\n  + ```opt.lg_extent_max_active_fit```  (@interwq)\r\n  + ```opt.max_background_threads```  (@djwatson)\r\n  + ```opt.metadata_thp```  (@interwq)\r\n  + ```opt.thp```  (@interwq)\r\n  + ```stats.metadata_thp```  (@interwq)\r\n\r\nPortability improvements:\r\n- Support GNU/kFreeBSD configuration.  (@paravoid)\r\n- Support m68k, nios2 and SH3 architectures.  (@paravoid)\r\n- Fall back to ```FD_CLOEXEC``` when ```O_CLOEXEC``` is unavailable.  (@zonyitoo)\r\n- Fix symbol listing for cross-compiling.  (@tamird)\r\n- Fix high bits computation on ARM.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @paravoid)\r\n- Disable the ```CPU_SPINWAIT``` macro for Power.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @marxin)\r\n- Fix MSVC 2015 & 2017 builds.  (@rustyx)\r\n- Improve RISC-V support.  (@EdSchouten)\r\n- Set name mangling script in strict mode.  (@nicolov)\r\n- Avoid ```MADV_HUGEPAGE``` on ARM.  (@marxin)\r\n- Modify configure to determine return value of ```strerror_r```.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @cferris1000)\r\n- Make sure CXXFLAGS is tested with CPP compiler.  (@nehaljwani)\r\n- Fix 32-bit build on MSVC.  (@rustyx)\r\n- Fix external symbol on MSVC.  (@maksqwe)\r\n- Avoid a printf format specifier warning.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add configure option ```--disable-initial-exec-tls``` which can allow jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @KenMacD)\r\n- AArch64: Add ILP32 support.  (@cmuellner)\r\n- Add ```--with-lg-vaddr``` configure option to support cross compiling.  (@cmuellner, @davidtgoldblatt)\r\n\r\nOptimizations and refactors:\r\n- Improve active extent fit with ```extent_max_active_fit```.  This considerably reduces fragmentation over time and improves virtual memory and metadata usage.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @interwq)\r\n- Eagerly coalesce large extents to reduce fragmentation.  (@interwq)\r\n- ```sdallocx```: only read size info when page aligned (i.e. possibly sampled), which speeds up the sized deallocation path significantly.  (@interwq)\r\n- Avoid attempting new mappings for in place expansion with retain, since it rarely succeeds in practice and causes high overhead.  (@interwq)\r\n- Refactor OOM handling in ```newImpl```.  (@wqfish)\r\n- Add internal fine-grained logging functionality for debugging use.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Refactor arena / tcache interactions.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Refactor extent management with dumpable flag.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Add runtime detection of lazy purging.  (@interwq)\r\n- Use pairing heap instead of red-black tree for extents_avail.  (@djwatson)\r\n- Use ```sysctl``` on startup in FreeBSD.  (@trasz)\r\n- Use thread local prng state instead of atomic.  (@djwatson)\r\n- Make decay to always purge one more extent than before, because in practice large extents are usually the ones that cross the decay threshold.  Purging the additional extent helps save memory as well as reduce VM fragmentation.  (@interwq)\r\n- Fast division by dynamic values.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Improve the fit for aligned allocation.  (@interwq, @edwinsmith)\r\n- Refactor extent_t bitpacking.  (@rkmisra)\r\n- Optimize the generated assembly for ticker operations.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Convert stats printing to use a structured text emitter.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Remove preserve_lru feature for extents management.  (@djwatson)\r\n- Consolidate two memory loads into one on the fast deallocation path.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @interwq)\r\n\r\nBug fixes (most of the issues are only relevant to jemalloc 5.0):\r\n- Fix deadlock with multithreaded fork in OS X.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Validate returned file descriptor before use.  (@zonyitoo)\r\n- Fix a few background thread initialization and shutdown issues.  (@interwq)\r\n- Fix an extent coalesce + decay race by taking both coalescing extents off the LRU list.  (@interwq)\r\n- Fix potentially unbound increase during decay, caused by one thread keep stashing memory to purge while other threads generating new pages.  The number of pages to purge is checked to prevent this.  (@interwq)\r\n- Fix a FreeBSD bootstrap assertion.  (@strejda, @interwq)\r\n- Handle 32 bit mutex counters.  (@rkmisra)\r\n- Fix a indexing bug when creating background threads.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @binliu19)\r\n- Fix arguments passed to extent_init.  (@yuleniwo, @interwq)\r\n- Fix addresses used for ordering mutexes.  (@rkmisra)\r\n- Fix ```abort_conf``` processing during bootstrap.  (@interwq)\r\n- Fix include path order for out-of-tree builds.  (@cmuellner)\r\n\r\nIncompatible changes:\r\n- Remove ```--disable-thp```.  (@interwq)\r\n- Remove mallctl interfaces:\r\n  + ```config.thp```  (@interwq)\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n  - Add ```TUNING.md```.

(@interwq)\r\n- Only abort on ```dlsym(3)``` error if the failure impacts an enabled feature (lazy locking and/or background threads).  This mitigates an initialization failure bug for which we still do not have a clear reproduction test case.  (@interwq)\r\n- Modify tsd management so that it neither crashes nor leaks if a thread's only allocation activity is to call ```free()``` after TLS destructors have been executed.  This behavior was observed when operating with GNU libc, and is unlikely to be an issue with other libc implementations.  (@interwq)\r\n- Mask signals during background thread creation.

(@interwq)\r\n- Fix extent_grow_retained() to use the specified hooks when the ```arena.<i>.extent_hooks``` mallctl is used to override the default hooks. (@interwq)\r\n- Add missing reentrancy support for custom extent hooks which allocate. (@interwq)\r\n- Post-```fork(2)```, re-initialize the list of tcaches associated with each arena to contain no tcaches except the forking thread's.

This change has few externally visible effects, but the internal impacts are... extensive.  Many other internal changes combine to make this the most cohesively designed version of jemalloc so far, with ample opportunity for further enhancements.\r\n\r\nContinuous integration is now an integral aspect of development thanks to the efforts of @davidtgoldblatt, and the dev branch tends to remain reasonably stable on the tested platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows).  As a side effect the official release frequency may decrease over time.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Implement optional per-CPU arena support; threads choose which arena to use based on current CPU rather than on fixed thread-->arena associations.  (@interwq)\r\n- Implement two-phase decay of unused dirty pages.  Pages transition from dirty-->muzzy-->clean, where the first phase transition relies on ```madvise(... MADV_FREE)``` semantics, and the second phase transition discards pages such that they are replaced with demand-zeroed pages on next access.  (@jasone)\r\n- Increase decay time resolution from seconds to milliseconds.  (@jasone)\r\n- Implement opt-in per CPU background threads, and use them for asynchronous decay-driven unused dirty page purging.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add mutex profiling, which collects a variety of statistics useful for diagnosing overhead/contention issues.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add C++ new/delete operator bindings.  (@djwatson)\r\n- Support manually created arena destruction, such that all data and metadata are discarded.  Add ```MALLCTL_ARENAS_DESTROYED``` for accessing merged stats associated with destroyed arenas.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add ```MALLCTL_ARENAS_ALL``` as a fixed index for use in accessing merged/destroyed arena statistics via mallctl.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add opt.abort_conf to optionally abort if invalid configuration options are detected during initialization.  (@interwq)\r\n- Add opt.stats_print_opts, so that e.g. JSON output can be selected for the stats dumped during exit if opt.stats_print is true.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add ```--with-version=VERSION``` for use when embedding jemalloc into another project's git repository.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add ```--disable-thp``` to support cross compiling.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add ```--with-lg-hugepage``` to support cross compiling.  (@jasone)\r\n- Add mallctl interfaces (various authors):\r\n  + ```background_thread```\r\n  + ```opt.abort_conf```\r\n  + ```opt.retain```\r\n  + ```opt.percpu_arena```\r\n  + ```opt.background_thread```\r\n  + ```opt.{dirty,muzzy}_decay_ms```\r\n  + ```opt.stats_print_opts```\r\n  + ```arena.<i>.initialized```\r\n  + ```arena.<i>.destroy```\r\n  + ```arena.<i>.{dirty,muzzy}_decay_ms```\r\n  + ```arena.<i>.extent_hooks```\r\n  + ```arenas.{dirty,muzzy}_decay_ms```\r\n  + ```arenas.bin.<i>.slab_size```\r\n  + ```arenas.nlextents```\r\n  + ```arenas.lextent.<i>.size```\r\n  + ```arenas.create```\r\n  + ```stats.background_thread.{num_threads,num_runs,run_interval}```\r\n  + ```stats.mutexes.{ctl,background_thread,prof,reset}.{num_ops,num_spin_acq,num_wait,max_wait_time,total_wait_time,max_num_thds,num_owner_switch}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.{dirty,muzzy}_decay_ms```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.uptime```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.{pmuzzy,base,internal,resident}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.{dirty,muzzy}_{npurge,nmadvise,purged}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.bins.<j>.{nslabs,reslabs,curslabs}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.bins.<j>.mutex.{num_ops,num_spin_acq,num_wait,max_wait_time,total_wait_time,max_num_thds,num_owner_switch}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.<i>.lextents.<j>.{nmalloc,ndalloc,nrequests,curlextents}```\r\n  + ```stats.arenas.i.mutexes.{large,extent_avail,extents_dirty,extents_muzzy,extents_retained,decay_dirty,decay_muzzy,base,tcache_list}.{num_ops,num_spin_acq,num_wait,max_wait_time,total_wait_time,max_num_thds,num_owner_switch}```\r\n\r\nPortability improvements:\r\n- Improve reentrant allocation support, such that deadlock is less likely if e.g. a system library call in turn allocates memory.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @interwq)\r\n- Support static linking of jemalloc with glibc.  (@djwatson)\r\n\r\nOptimizations and refactors:\r\n- Organize virtual memory as \"extents\" of virtual memory pages, rather than as naturally aligned \"chunks\", and store all metadata in arbitrarily distant locations.  This reduces virtual memory external fragmentation, and will interact better with huge pages (not yet explicitly supported).  (@jasone)\r\n- Fold large and huge size classes together; only small and large size classes remain.  (@jasone)\r\n- Unify the allocation paths, and merge most fast-path branching decisions. (@davidtgoldblatt, @interwq)\r\n- Embed per thread automatic tcache into thread-specific data, which reduces conditional branches and dereferences.  Also reorganize tcache to increase fast-path data locality.  (@interwq)\r\n- Rewrite atomics to closely model the C11 API, convert various synchronization from mutex-based to atomic, and use the explicit memory ordering control to resolve various hypothetical races without increasing synchronization overhead.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Extensively optimize rtree via various methods:\r\n  + Add multiple layers of rtree lookup caching, since rtree lookups are now part of fast-path deallocation.  (@interwq)\r\n  + Determine rtree layout at compile time.  (@jasone)\r\n  + Make the tree shallower for common configurations.  (@jasone)\r\n  + Embed the root node in the top-level rtree data structure, thus avoiding one level of indirection.  (@jasone)\r\n  + Further specialize leaf elements as compared to internal node elements, and directly embed extent metadata needed for fast-path deallocation.  (@jasone)\r\n  + Ignore leading always-zero address bits (architecture-specific).  (@jasone)\r\n- Reorganize headers (ongoing work) to make them hermetic, and disentangle various module dependencies.  (@davidtgoldblatt)\r\n- Convert various internal data structures such as size class metadata from boot-time-initialized to compile-time-initialized.  Propagate resulting data structure simplifications, such as making arena metadata fixed-size.  (@jasone)\r\n- Simplify size class lookups when constrained to size classes that are multiples of the page size.  This speeds lookups, but the primary benefit is complexity reduction in code that was the source of numerous regressions.  (@jasone)\r\n- Lock individual extents when possible for localized extent operations, rather than relying on a top-level arena lock.  (@davidtgoldblatt, @jasone)\r\n- Use first fit layout policy instead of best fit, in order to improve packing.

Many people worked on this release, to an extent that even with the omission here of minor changes (see git revision history), and of the people who reported and diagnosed issues, so much of the work was contributed that starting with this release, changes are annotated with author credits to help reflect the collaborative effort involved.\n\nNew features:\n- Implement decay-based unused dirty page purging, a major optimization with mallctl API impact.  This is an alternative to the existing ratio-based unused dirty page purging, and is intended to eventually become the sole purging mechanism.  New mallctls:\n  - `opt.purge`\n  - `opt.decay_time`\n  - `arena.<i>.decay`\n  - `arena.<i>.decay_time`\n  - `arenas.decay_time`\n  - `stats.arenas.<i>.decay_time`\n  \n  (@jasone, @cevans87)\n- Add `--with-malloc-conf`, which makes it possible to embed a default options string during configuration.  This was motivated by the desire to specify `--with-malloc-conf=purge:decay` , since the default must remain `purge:ratio` until the 5.0.0 release.  (@jasone)\n- Add MS Visual Studio 2015 support.  (@rustyx, @yuslepukhin)\n- Make *allocx() size class overflow behavior defined.  The maximum size class is now less than `PTRDIFF_MAX` to protect applications against numerical overflow, and all allocation functions are guaranteed to indicate errors rather than potentially crashing if the request size exceeds the maximum size class.  (@jasone)\n- jeprof:\n  - Add raw heap profile support.  (@jasone)\n  - Add `--retain` and `--exclude` for backtrace symbol filtering.  (@jasone)\n\nOptimizations:\n- Optimize the fast path to combine various bootstrapping and configuration checks and execute more streamlined code in the common case.  (@interwq)\n- Use linear scan for small bitmaps (used for small object tracking).  In addition to speeding up bitmap operations on 64-bit systems, this reduces allocator metadata overhead by approximately 0.2%.  (@djwatson)\n- Separate `arena_avail` trees, which substantially speeds up run tree operations.  (@djwatson)\n- Use memoization (boot-time-computed table) for run quantization.  Separate `arena_avail` trees reduced the importance of this optimization.  (@jasone)\n- Attempt mmap-based in-place huge reallocation.  This can dramatically speed up incremental huge reallocation.  (@jasone)\n\nIncompatible changes:\n- Make `opt.narenas` `unsigned` rather than `size_t`.  (@jasone)\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix `stats.cactive` accounting regression.  (@rustyx, @jasone)\n- Handle unaligned keys in `hash()`.  This caused problems for some ARM systems.  (@jasone, Christopher Ferris)\n- Refactor arenas array.  In addition to fixing a fork-related deadlock, this makes arena lookups faster and simpler.  (@jasone)\n- Move retained memory allocation out of the default chunk allocation function, to a location that gets executed even if the application installs a custom chunk allocation function.  This resolves a virtual memory leak.  (@buchgr)\n- Fix a potential `tsd` cleanup leak.  (Christopher Ferris, @jasone)\n- Fix run quantization.  In practice this bug had no impact unless applications requested memory with alignment exceeding one page.  (@jasone, @djwatson)\n- Fix LinuxThreads-specific bootstrapping deadlock.  (Cosmin Paraschiv)\n- jeprof:\n  - Don't discard curl options if timeout is not defined.  (@djwatson)\n  - Detect failed profile fetches.  (@djwatson)\n- Fix `stats.arenas.<i>.{dss,lg_dirty_mult,decay_time,pactive,pdirty}` for `--disable-stats` case.

is a bugfix release that is somewhat high risk due to the amount of refactoring required to address deep xallocx() problems.  As a side effect of these fixes, xallocx() now tries harder to partially fulfill requests for optional extra space.  Note that a couple of minor heap profiling optimizations are included, but these are better thought of as performance fixes that were integral to discovering most of the other bugs.\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- Avoid a chunk metadata read in arena_prof_tctx_set(), since it is in the fast path when heap profiling is enabled.  Additionally, split a special case out into arena_prof_tctx_reset(), which also avoids chunk metadata reads.\r\n- Optimize irallocx_prof() to optimistically update the sampler state.  The prior implementation appears to have been a holdover from when rallocx()/xallocx() functionality was combined as rallocm().\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fix TLS configuration such that it is enabled by default for platforms on which it works correctly.\r\n- Fix arenas_cache_cleanup() and arena_get_hard() to handle allocation/deallocation within the application's thread-specific data cleanup functions even after arenas_cache is torn down.\r\n- Fix xallocx() bugs related to size+extra exceeding HUGE_MAXCLASS.\r\n- Fix chunk purge hook calls for in-place huge shrinking reallocation to specify the old chunk size rather than the new chunk size.  This bug caused no correctness issues for the default chunk purge function, but was visible to custom functions set via the \"arena.&lt;i&gt;.chunk_hooks\" mallctl.\r\n- Fix heap profiling bugs:\r\n  - Fix heap profiling to distinguish among otherwise identical sample sites with interposed resets (triggered via the \"prof.reset\" mallctl).  This bug could cause data structure corruption that would most likely result in a segfault.\r\n  - Fix irealloc_prof() to prof_alloc_rollback() on OOM.\r\n  - Make one call to prof_active_get_unlocked() per allocation event, and use the result throughout the relevant functions that handle an allocation event.  Also add a missing check in prof_realloc().  These fixes protect allocation events against concurrent prof_active changes.\r\n  - Fix ixallocx_prof() to pass usize_max and zero to ixallocx_prof_sample() in the correct order.\r\n  - Fix prof_realloc() to call prof_free_sampled_object() after calling prof_malloc_sample_object().  Prior to this fix, if tctx and old_tctx were the same, the tctx could have been prematurely destroyed.\r\n- Fix portability bugs:\r\n  - Don't bitshift by negative amounts when encoding/decoding run sizes in chunk header maps.  This affected systems with page sizes greater than 8 KiB.\r\n  - Rename index_t to szind_t to avoid an existing type on Solaris.\r\n  - Add JEMALLOC_CXX_THROW to the memalign() function prototype, in order to match glibc and avoid compilation errors when including both jemalloc/jemalloc.h and malloc.h in C++ code.\r\n  - Don't assume that /bin/sh is appropriate when running size_classes.sh during configuration.\r\n  - Consider __sparcv9 a synonym for __sparc64__ when defining LG_QUANTUM.\r\n  - Link tests to librt if it contains clock_gettime(2).\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1684270","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1684270/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1684270/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/tag/4.0.0","id":1684270,"author":{"login":"jasone","id":245970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone","html_url":"https://github.com/jasone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2ODQyNzA=","tag_name":"4.0.0","target_commitish":"dev","name":"4.0.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-08-17T20:23:41Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T20:41:02Z","published_at":"2015-08-17T20:41:02Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/assets/796194","id":796194,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDc5NjE5NA==","name":"jemalloc-4.0.0.tar.bz2","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jasone","id":245970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone","html_url":"https://github.com/jasone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-bzip2","state":"uploaded","size":385037,"digest":null,"download_count":7028,"created_at":"2015-08-17T20:39:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T20:39:51Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/download/4.0.0/jemalloc-4.0.0.tar.bz2"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/tarball/4.0.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/zipball/4.0.0","body":"This version contains many speed and space optimizations, both minor and major.  The major themes are generalization, unification, and simplification.  Although many of these optimizations cause no visible behavior change, their cumulative effect is substantial.\n\nNew features:\n- Normalize size class spacing to be consistent across the complete size range.  By default there are four size classes per size doubling, but this is now configurable via the --with-lg-size-class-group option.  Also add the --with-lg-page, --with-lg-page-sizes, --with-lg-quantum, and --with-lg-tiny-min options, which can be used to tweak page and size class settings.  Impacts:\n  - Worst case performance for incrementally growing/shrinking reallocation is improved because there are far fewer size classes, and therefore copying happens less often.\n  - Internal fragmentation is limited to 20% for all but the smallest size classes (those less than four times the quantum).  (1B + 4 KiB) and (1B + 4 MiB) previously suffered nearly 50% internal fragmentation.\n  - Chunk fragmentation tends to be lower because there are fewer distinct run sizes to pack.\n- Add support for explicit tcaches.  The \"tcache.create\", \"tcache.flush\", and \"tcache.destroy\" mallctls control tcache lifetime and flushing, and the MALLOCX_TCACHE(tc) and MALLOCX_TCACHE_NONE flags to the *allocx() API control which tcache is used for each operation.\n- Implement per thread heap profiling, as well as the ability to enable/disable heap profiling on a per thread basis.  Add the \"prof.reset\", \"prof.lg_sample\", \"thread.prof.name\", \"thread.prof.active\", \"opt.prof_thread_active_init\", \"prof.thread_active_init\", and \"thread.prof.active\" mallctls.\n- Add support for per arena application-specified chunk allocators, configured via the \"arena.&lt;i&gt;.chunk_hooks\" mallctl.\n- Refactor huge allocation to be managed by arenas, so that arenas now function as general purpose independent allocators.  This is important in the context of user-specified chunk allocators, aside from the scalability benefits.  Related new statistics:\n  - The \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.huge.allocated\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.huge.nmalloc\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.huge.ndalloc\", and \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.huge.nrequests\" mallctls provide high level per arena huge allocation statistics.\n  - The \"arenas.nhchunks\", \"arenas.hchunk.&lt;i&gt;.size\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.hchunks.&lt;j&gt;.nmalloc\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.hchunks.&lt;j&gt;.ndalloc\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.hchunks.&lt;j&gt;.nrequests\", and \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.hchunks.&lt;j&gt;.curhchunks\" mallctls provide per size class statistics.\n- Add the 'util' column to malloc_stats_print() output, which reports the proportion of available regions that are currently in use for each small size class.\n- Add \"alloc\" and \"free\" modes for for junk filling (see the \"opt.junk\" mallctl), so that it is possible to separately enable junk filling for allocation versus deallocation.\n- Add the jemalloc-config script, which provides information about how jemalloc was configured, and how to integrate it into application builds.\n- Add metadata statistics, which are accessible via the \"stats.metadata\", \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.metadata.mapped\", and \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.metadata.allocated\" mallctls.\n- Add the \"stats.resident\" mallctl, which reports the upper limit of physically resident memory mapped by the allocator.\n- Add per arena control over unused dirty page purging, via the \"arenas.lg_dirty_mult\", \"arena.&lt;i&gt;.lg_dirty_mult\", and \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.lg_dirty_mult\" mallctls.\n- Add the \"prof.gdump\" mallctl, which makes it possible to toggle the gdump feature on/off during program execution.\n- Add sdallocx(), which implements sized deallocation.  The primary optimization over dallocx() is the removal of a metadata read, which often suffers an L1 cache miss.\n- Add missing header includes in jemalloc/jemalloc.h, so that applications only have to #include &lt;jemalloc/jemalloc.h&gt;.\n- Add support for additional platforms:\n  - Bitrig\n  - Cygwin\n  - DragonFlyBSD\n  - iOS\n  - OpenBSD\n  - OpenRISC/or1k\n\nOptimizations:\n- Maintain dirty runs in per arena LRUs rather than in per arena trees of dirty-run-containing chunks.  In practice this change significantly reduces dirty page purging volume.\n- Integrate whole chunks into the unused dirty page purging machinery.  This reduces the cost of repeated huge allocation/deallocation, because it effectively introduces a cache of chunks.\n- Split the arena chunk map into two separate arrays, in order to increase cache locality for the frequently accessed bits.\n- Move small run metadata out of runs, into arena chunk headers.  This reduces run fragmentation, smaller runs reduce external fragmentation for small size classes, and packed (less uniformly aligned) metadata layout improves CPU cache set distribution.\n- Randomly distribute large allocation base pointer alignment relative to page boundaries in order to more uniformly utilize CPU cache sets.  This can be disabled via the --disable-cache-oblivious configure option, and queried via the \"config.cache_oblivious\" mallctl.\n- Micro-optimize the fast paths for the public API functions.\n- Refactor thread-specific data to reside in a single structure.  This assures that only a single TLS read is necessary per call into the public API.\n- Implement in-place huge allocation growing and shrinking.\n- Refactor rtree (radix tree for chunk lookups) to be lock-free, and make additional optimizations that reduce maximum lookup depth to one or two levels.  This resolves what was a concurrency bottleneck for per arena huge allocation, because a global data structure is critical for determining which arenas own which huge allocations.\n\nIncompatible changes:\n- Replace --enable-cc-silence with --disable-cc-silence to suppress spurious warnings by default.\n- Assure that the constness of malloc_usable_size()'s return type matches that of the system implementation.\n- Change the heap profile dump format to support per thread heap profiling, rename pprof to jeprof, and enhance it with the --thread=&lt;n&gt; option.  As a result, the bundled jeprof must now be used rather than the upstream (gperftools) pprof.\n- Disable \"opt.prof_final\" by default, in order to avoid atexit(3), which can internally deadlock on some platforms.\n- Change the \"arenas.nlruns\" mallctl type from size_t to unsigned.\n- Replace the \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.bins.&lt;j&gt;.allocated\" mallctl with \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.bins.&lt;j&gt;.curregs\".\n- Ignore MALLOC_CONF in set{uid,gid,cap} binaries.\n- Ignore MALLOCX_ARENA(a) in dallocx(), in favor of using the MALLOCX_TCACHE(tc) and MALLOCX_TCACHE_NONE flags to control tcache usage.\n\nRemoved features:\n- Remove the *allocm() API, which is superseded by the *allocx() API.\n- Remove the --enable-dss options, and make dss non-optional on all platforms which support sbrk(2).\n- Remove the \"arenas.purge\" mallctl, which was obsoleted by the \"arena.&lt;i&gt;.purge\" mallctl in 3.1.0.\n- Remove the unnecessary \"opt.valgrind\" mallctl; jemalloc automatically detects whether it is running inside Valgrind.\n- Remove the \"stats.huge.allocated\", \"stats.huge.nmalloc\", and \"stats.huge.ndalloc\" mallctls.\n- Remove the --enable-mremap option.\n- Remove the \"stats.chunks.current\", \"stats.chunks.total\", and \"stats.chunks.high\" mallctls.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix the cactive statistic to decrease (rather than increase) when active memory decreases.

The *allocx() functions are slightly simpler to use because they have\n  fewer parameters, they directly return the results of primary interest, and\n  mallocx()/rallocx() avoid the strict aliasing pitfall that\n  allocm()/rallocm() share with posix_memalign().  Note that *allocm() is\n  slated for removal in the next non-bugfix release.\n- Add support for LinuxThreads.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Unless heap profiling is enabled, disable floating point code and don't link\n  with libm.  This, in combination with e.g. EXTRA_CFLAGS=-mno-sse on x64\n  systems, makes it possible to completely disable floating point register\n  use.  Some versions of glibc neglect to save/restore caller-saved floating\n  point registers during dynamic lazy symbol loading, and the symbol loading\n  code uses whatever malloc the application happens to have linked/loaded\n  with, the result being potential floating point register corruption.\n- Report ENOMEM rather than EINVAL if an OOM occurs during heap profiling\n  backtrace creation in imemalign().  This bug impacted posix_memalign() and\n  aligned_alloc().\n- Fix a file descriptor leak in a prof_dump_maps() error path.\n- Fix prof_dump() to close the dump file descriptor for all relevant error\n  paths.\n- Fix rallocm() to use the arena specified by the ALLOCM_ARENA(s) flag for\n  allocation, not just deallocation.\n- Fix a data race for large allocation stats counters.\n- Fix a potential infinite loop during thread exit.  This bug occurred on\n  Solaris, and could affect other platforms with similar pthreads TSD\n  implementations.\n- Don't junk-fill reallocations unless usable size changes.  This fixes a\n  violation of the _allocx()/_allocm() semantics.\n- Fix growing large reallocation to junk fill new space.\n- Fix huge deallocation to junk fill when munmap is disabled.\n- Change the default private namespace prefix from empty to je_, and change\n  --with-private-namespace-prefix so that it prepends an additional prefix\n  rather than replacing je_.  This reduces the likelihood of applications\n  which statically link jemalloc experiencing symbol name collisions.\n- Add missing private namespace mangling (relevant when\n  --with-private-namespace is specified).\n- Add and use JEMALLOC_INLINE_C so that static inline functions are marked as\n  static even for debug builds.\n- Add a missing mutex unlock in a malloc_init_hard() error path.  In practice\n  this error path is never executed.\n- Fix numerous bugs in malloc_strotumax() error handling/reporting.  These\n  bugs had no impact except for malformed inputs.\n- Fix numerous bugs in malloc_snprintf().

this version adds some major new features, the primary focus is on internal code cleanup that facilitates maintainability and portability, most of which is not reflected in the ChangeLog.  This is the first release to incorporate substantial contributions from numerous other developers, and the result is a more broadly useful allocator (see the git revision history for contribution details).  Note that the license has been unified, thanks to Facebook granting a license under the same terms as the other copyright holders (see COPYING).\n\nNew features:\n- Implement Valgrind support, redzones, and quarantine.\n- Add support for additional platforms:\n  - FreeBSD\n  - Mac OS X Lion\n  - MinGW\n  - Windows (no support yet for replacing the system malloc)\n- Add support for additional architectures:\n  - MIPS\n  - SH4\n  - Tilera\n- Add support for cross compiling.\n- Add nallocm(), which rounds a request size up to the nearest size class\n  without actually allocating.\n- Implement aligned_alloc() (blame C11).\n- Add the \"thread.tcache.enabled\" mallctl.\n- Add the \"opt.prof_final\" mallctl.\n- Update pprof (from gperftools 2.0).\n- Add the --with-mangling option.\n- Add the --disable-experimental option.\n- Add the --disable-munmap option, and make it the default on Linux.\n- Add the --enable-mremap option, which disables use of mremap(2) by default.\n\nIncompatible changes:\n- Enable stats by default.\n- Enable fill by default.\n- Disable lazy locking by default.\n- Rename the \"tcache.flush\" mallctl to \"thread.tcache.flush\".\n- Rename the \"arenas.pagesize\" mallctl to \"arenas.page\".\n- Change the \"opt.lg_prof_sample\" default from 0 to 19 (1 B to 512 KiB).\n- Change the \"opt.prof_accum\" default from true to false.\n\nRemoved features:\n- Remove the swap feature, including the \"config.swap\", \"swap.avail\",\n  \"swap.prezeroed\", \"swap.nfds\", and \"swap.fds\" mallctls.\n- Remove highruns statistics, including the\n  \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.bins.&lt;j&gt;.highruns\" and\n  \"stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.lruns.&lt;j&gt;.highruns\" mallctls.\n- As part of small size class refactoring, remove the \"opt.lg_[qc]space_max\",\n  \"arenas.cacheline\", \"arenas.subpage\", \"arenas.[tqcs]space_{min,max}\", and\n  \"arenas.[tqcs]bins\" mallctls.\n- Remove the \"arenas.chunksize\" mallctl.\n- Remove the \"opt.lg_prof_tcmax\" option.\n- Remove the \"opt.lg_prof_bt_max\" option.\n- Remove the \"opt.lg_tcache_gc_sweep\" option.\n- Remove the --disable-tiny option, including the \"config.tiny\" mallctl.\n- Remove the --enable-dynamic-page-shift configure option.\n- Remove the --enable-sysv configure option.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix a statistics-related bug in the \"thread.arena\" mallctl that could cause\n  invalid statistics and crashes.\n- Work around TLS deallocation via free() on Linux.  This bug could cause\n  write-after-free memory corruption.\n- Fix a potential deadlock that could occur during interval- and\n  growth-triggered heap profile dumps.\n- Fix large calloc() zeroing bugs due to dropping chunk map unzeroed flags.\n- Fix chunk_alloc_dss() to stop claiming memory is zeroed.  This bug could\n  cause memory corruption and crashes with --enable-dss specified.\n- Fix fork-related bugs that could cause deadlock in children between fork\n  and exec.\n- Fix malloc_stats_print() to honor 'b' and 'l' in the opts parameter.\n- Fix realloc(p, 0) to act like free(p).\n- Do not enforce minimum alignment in memalign().\n- Check for NULL pointer in malloc_usable_size().\n- Fix an off-by-one heap profile statistics bug that could be observed in\n  interval- and growth-triggered heap profiles.\n- Fix the \"epoch\" mallctl to update cached stats even if the passed in epoch\n  is 0.\n- Fix bin->runcur management to fix a layout policy bug.  This bug did not\n  affect correctness.\n- Fix a bug in choose_arena_hard() that potentially caused more arenas to be\n  initialized than necessary.\n- Add missing \"opt.lg_tcache_max\" mallctl implementation.\n- Use glibc allocator hooks to make mixed allocator usage less likely.\n- Fix build issues for --disable-tcache.\n- Don't mangle pthread_create() when --with-private-namespace is specified.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1184922","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1184922/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/1184922/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/tag/2.2.5","id":1184922,"author":{"login":"jasone","id":245970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone","html_url":"https://github.com/jasone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTExODQ5MjI=","tag_name":"2.2.5","target_commitish":"dev","name":"2.2.5","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2011-11-15T01:17:37Z","updated_at":"2015-04-18T16:47:24Z","published_at":"2015-04-18T16:47:24Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/assets/531749","id":531749,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDUzMTc0OQ==","name":"jemalloc-2.2.5.tar.bz2","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jasone","id":245970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone","html_url":"https://github.com/jasone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-bzip2","state":"uploaded","size":224118,"digest":null,"download_count":10923,"created_at":"2015-04-18T16:47:10Z","updated_at":"2015-04-18T16:47:11Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/download/2.2.5/jemalloc-2.2.5.tar.bz2"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/tarball/2.2.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jemalloc/jemalloc/zipball/2.2.5","body":"Bug fixes:\n- Fix huge_ralloc() race when using mremap(2).
