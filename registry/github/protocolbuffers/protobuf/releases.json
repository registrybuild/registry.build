Note that it is still strongly recommended to regenerate your gencode with a newer protoc and to avoid using gencode which was created with an old protoc.\r\n\r\nGenerated code from this range is covered by CVE-2022-3171 and is potentially vulnerable to a Denial of Service risk.\r\n\r\nJavaProto 4.x previously dropped compatibility with the potentially vulnerable generated code, having the behavior of:\r\n* The vulnerable generated code was source-incompatible with new runtime (would not compile when built from source)\r\n* The vulnerable generated code was ABI-incompatible with new runtime (when using a .class file compiled against old runtime, a NoSuchMethodException would be thrown at parse time).\r\n\r\nStarting with this release:\r\n* The vulnerable generated code is now source-compatible (will compile).\r\n* The first time each potentially vulnerable type is parsed, an error message will be logged noting that potentially vulnerable generated code is in use and the name of the corresponding type.\r\n* Environment variables may be set to either throw an exception instead (`-Dcom.google.protobuf.error_on_unsafe_pre22_gencode`) or to entirely silence the logged messages (`-Dcom.google.protobuf.use_unsafe_pre22_gencode`)\r\n\r\nThis change was made based on community feedback regarding the difficulty in identifying and quickly remediating stale gencode in their transitive dependencies weighed against a careful evaluation of the realistic risk exposure of DoS (with no risk of other concerns including information leak or RCE).\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that any users who observe the log messages to regenerate the corresponding code with a newer protoc. We recommend that any security-conscious services opt into the `error_on_unsafe_pre22_gencode` behavior to preclude any risk of a Denial of Service surface area being exposed.\r\n\r\nA future 4.x release may flip the default behavior to error by default as a measure to further help the ecosystem avoid the Denial of Service risks, while still maintaining the ability to opt into continuing to use insecure gencode for users who are parsing trusted inputs and where the difficulty of regenerating is high.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Switch the pre22 warning to use CopyOnWriteArraySet.
