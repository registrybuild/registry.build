ANTLR version 4.10\r\n\r\nThis is a very major release with a number of important changes. There have been many valuable contributions, but I welcome @KvanTTT and @jcking as recent \"official\" major ANTLR contributors. :)\r\n\r\n**WARNING**:  *Generated 4.10 lexers and parsers are incompatible with code generated by previous versions of ANTLR. You must regenerate all of your code from grammars to use the new runtime. This is true of all targets (except probably javascript).*\r\n\r\n## Repo branching structure\r\n\r\nWe have changed the branching structure of the repository. The default branch for this repo remains [`master`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master) and it is the latest stable release with tags for the various releases; e.g., see release tag [4.9.3](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/4.9.3).  We now do development work in branch [`dev`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/dev) between releases and all pull requests should be derived from that branch. The `dev` branch is merged back into `master` to cut a release and the release state is tagged (e.g., with `4.10-rc.1` or `4.10`.) Visually our process looks roughly like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/doc/images/new-antlr-branches.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n\r\nTargets such as Go that pull directly from the repository can use the default `master` branch but can also pull from the active `dev` branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr@dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Developers certificate of origin\r\n\r\nIn order to bring ANTLR more in line with current standard standards for contribution processes, as of 4.10, ANTLR uses the [Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). See file [https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/developer-cert-of-origin.txt ](developer-cert-of-origin.txt ). It is simpler than the original contributors license agreement, which required programmers to sign the `contributors.txt` file, which has now moved to file [historical-contributors-agreement.txt ](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/historical-contributors-agreement.txt).\r\n\r\nEach commit in pull requests must have a \"signature\", which is simple as using `-s` (not `-S`) on the git commit command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'\r\n```\r\n\r\nGithub's pull request process enforces the sig and gives instructions on how to fix any commits that lack the sig. See [https://github.com/apps/dco](https://github.com/apps/dco) for more info.\r\n\r\n## 4.10-generated parsers incompatible with previous runtimes\r\n\r\nANTLR not only generates recursive-descent parsers; it generates a state machine called an augmented transition network (ATN) in serialized form as a bunch of integers stored in the generated parser and lexer files. This serialization format was changed for 4.10 to remove a size limit on the supported ATNs. See https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/3591.\r\n\r\nThe key point here is that we changed the version number stored inside the serialization format and so, in order to use this new version of ANTLR, you must regenerate all of your lexers and parsers using the 4.10 tool and then use the new runtime. Parsers generated with 4.10 or not compatible with previous versions of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Increasing minimum java version\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we are using Java 11 for the source code and the compiled .class files for the ANTLR tool. The Java runtime target, however, and the associated runtime tests use Java 8 (bumping up from Java 7).\r\n\r\n## JavaScript target\r\n\r\nThe JS target has been substantially reworked.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous improvements\r\n\r\n* Lexer rules can use the `caseInsensitive` option now.\r\n* Improved error messages\r\n* We rebuilt the runtime testing rig and made continuous integration improvements; part of this was done to support more recent versions of Java\r\n* We cleaned up the maven pom and brought it up to date (still has errors if somebody can make a suggestion.)\r\n\r\n#

After much thought concerning the \"create stream\" interface, I have decided on the following end result: C++, Python, Go, and Swift APIs didn't need any changes to support full Unicode code points, so I decided to leave those alone. Java, C#, and JavaScript runtimes required changes. Rather than gutting and changing the interface of the previous ANTLRFileStream etc..., I have deprecated those and introduced a CharStreams.fromXXX factory style interface for creating streams. For example, `CharStreams.fromFileName(\"foo.txt\"))`.

C++ is the only other target with the unbuffered stream and it worked as-is.\r\n  * [Change UnbufferedCharStream to use code points](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1796)\r\n  * [Use UTF-8 by default in UnbufferedCharStream and allow specifying charset]()\r\n  * [C#: Change UnbufferedCharStream to use 32-bit Unicode code points and 32-bit buffer](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1798)\r\n* In addition to creating `CharStreams` capable of supporting 21-bit Unicode, we added notation for Unicode code points beyond 16 bits (4 hexadecimal digits). The usual notation `\\uABCD` still works for the basic code points but you can now use `\\u{1FFFF}..\\u{10FFFF}` to access the full range:\r\n  * [New extended Unicode escape \\u{10ABCD} to support Unicode literals > U+FFFF](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1633)\r\n  * [Support UTF-32 escape sequences](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/276)\r\n* You can also include all characters matching Unicode properties such as `[\\p{Emoji}]`:\r\n  * [Add new \\p{Extended_Pictographic} and related Unicode property escapes](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1754)\r\n  * [Also support Unicode enumerated properties via \\p{Foo=Bar} syntax](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1739)\r\n  * [Update docs for new Unicode literal and property escapes](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1710)\r\n  * [New class EscapeSequenceParsing with \\p{UnicodeProperty} support](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1693)\r\n  * [New \\p{Letter} Unicode property escape](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1688)\r\n  * [A few last escapes: \\p{EmojiPresentation=EmojiDefault} and \\p{EmojiPresentation=TextDefault}](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1757)\r\n  * [UnicodeData: Also support Unicode blocks](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1692)\r\n\r\n* The C# target now supports [.NET Core Support](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1229), thanks to David Neumann @lecode-official and Dong Xie @xied75!\r\n* We did quite a bit of cleaning up in the lexer escape char and char set areas (big thanks to Ivan Kochurkin @KvanTTT):\r\n    * [Escapes sequence recognition failure in character sets](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1537)\r\n    * [Throw \"invalid escape sequence\" for double quote in string literals: '&#92;\"'](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1717)\r\n    * [Fixed incorrect \"used multiple times\" warning.](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1715)\r\n    * [error-> warnings.

I implemented a handbuilt lexer to get rid of this dependency on a grammar: [XPathLexer not updated in release process](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1620), [Fixes #1620. Make handbuilt lexer to avoid cyclic dependence of tool and plugin.](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1748)\r\n\r\n* The Java, Swift, and C++ targets have added a hook to the construction of parse tree leaf nodes: [factor out the creation of error nodes and terminal nodes in the parser](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1665).

We were seeing a number of reports of nonterminating parses for very large expressions with grammars that used left recursive rule specifications (like `e : e '*' e | INT ;`). Sam noticed that the parsing engine detected an ambiguity between two choices and resolved it properly but that both would lead to a valid parse. It turns out that the first choice is what led to really slow parsing but the second choice is much faster and still yields a valid parse. Most targets have added that improvement.  Here is the [discussion of the issue and solution](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1398) and the [primary patch for java](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1404).\n- **Error handling** improved in cases related to LL(1) decisions for optional and closure subrules. Matching sets of tokens were also sometimes considered resynchronization (error) tokens.

It adds a backing field for `altNumber`, the alt matched for the associated rule node. \n- [Added `getMaxTokenType()` to `Vocabulary` interface](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1146)\n\nComplete list of [pull requests for 4.5.3](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pulls?q=milestone%3A4.5.3+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr) but most of those are fixing bugs.\n\n# Issues\n\nComplete list of [issues closed/solved for 4.5.2](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A4.5.3+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antlr/antlr4/releases/2510807","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antlr/antlr4/releases/2510807/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/antlr/antlr4/releases/2510807/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/releases/tag/4.5.2","id":2510807,"author":{"login":"parrt","id":178777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODc3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt","html_url":"https://github.com/parrt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parrt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI1MTA4MDc=","tag_name":"4.5.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"4.5.2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-01-30T18:01:50Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T17:56:28Z","published_at":"2016-03-28T17:56:28Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antlr/antlr4/tarball/4.5.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antlr/antlr4/zipball/4.5.2","body":"# Features / improvements\n- removed final (hopefully!) dependency on Java AWT lib in runtime.\n- moved doc, faq from wiki to the repo.\n- added more tool error checks.\n- major Python speed improvement with better hash function (minutes to seconds)\n\nComplete list of [pull requests for 4.5.2](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues?q=milestone%3A4.5.2+is%3Aclosed) but most of those are fixing bugs.\n\n# Issues\n\nSummary: some clean up in JavaScript and Python targets.

Class `org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig` has moved to `org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig` but we left a proxy in so that `org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig` still works. The `org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.gui` package moved to `org.antlr.v4.gui` in the tool area from the runtime. A few classes from `org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc` had to move.  Convenience methods for saving/viewing parse trees were moved from `RuleContext` (parse tree) and `org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.Trees` to `org.antlr.v4.gui.Trees`.\n\nYou can view all [Issues fixed in 4.5.1](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues?q=milestone%3A4.5.1+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue), all [pull requests merged](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pulls?q=milestone%3A4.5.1+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr) and all [commits for this release](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/compare/4.5...4.5.1-beta-1).\n\n### Features\n- [Add goto to reserved words for java](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/870)\n- [Create functionality to get all possible parse trees for ambiguous input.](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/816)\n- [Makes TestRig's dialog to save and restore its state](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/812)\n- [Parser.setProfile() should keep settings like prediction mode](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/809)\n- [Make Grammar-object-aware ParserInterpreter ](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/905) (This interpreter will have parse tree nodes that know which alternative or label was matched for a particular parse tree subtree root.)\n- [Check for nonconforming left-recursive rules.](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/873)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- [Null pointer in named alternative with attributes](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/855)\n- [NullPointerException in bad recursion](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/822)\n- [Parser.setProfile() should keep settings like prediction mode](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/809)\n- [Allow parsing decision override for (decision, input index) in parsers](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/807)\n- [Random ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions coming from ParserATNSimulator](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/804)\n- [Empty rule matched first gives invalid source interval](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/897)\n- [EOF leaf not included in parent tree source interval](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/896)\n- [Rule parameter in left recursive rules disallowed](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/773)\n- [wrong location on import error message reference to undefined rule](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/823)\n- [NotNull import is not deleted in Java.stg](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/815)\n\n## Download Binaries\n\nDownload the [ANTLR tool and all target runtimes at the antlr.org site](http://www.antlr.org/download/index.html).\n\nThe Java jars are OSGi compatible so you should be able to use them within Eclipse.\n\n### Runtime Libraries for Language Targets\n- Java is embedded with the tool, but is also available from maven-central\n- [C#](http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-csharp-runtime-4.5.1.zip) (zipped .dll) is a download from antlr.org.

Instead, use the special symbol `$ctx` to refer to the enclosing rule. Parsers already generated from grammars prior to this change are not affected, but the grammar will need to be updated prior to generating code with ANTLR 4.3. This change was required as part of correcting #571.\n- `IntervalSet.getMinElement` now returns the first element, even if that element is negative. Code which relied on this method to return a non-negative value even if the set contained negative values will need to be updated.\n\n### Related Projects\n\nThe following tables list several related projects, along with the version number corresponding to this release.
