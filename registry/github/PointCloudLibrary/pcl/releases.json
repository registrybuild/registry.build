now defaults to the C++14 standard. Most of the Boost classes that we use were replaced with alternatives from the standard library. One notable exception are smart pointers. PCL still makes extensive use of `boost::shared_ptr`. However, several layers of abstraction  have been added to prepare for a smooth switch to `std::shared_ptr` in the next release:\r\n  * Added `pcl::make_shared` and `Class::Ptr`/`Class::ConstPtr` type-aliases. Use these instead of  direct names like `{boost, std}::shared_ptr` or `{boost, std}::make_shared` with PCL types.\r\n  * Added `pcl::shared_ptr` that offers the same abstraction for non-PCL types.\r\n\r\nPlease use the above-mentioned functions/aliases in downstream projects to ensure source code level compatibility with PCL 1.10 and future PCL releases.\r\n\r\nSee
