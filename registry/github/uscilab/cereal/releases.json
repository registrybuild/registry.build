Many of these come from community contributions.\r\n\r\nWith this release, the `develop` branch is being removed in favor of a single default branch. This means that tagged releases should be used in favor of trusting the master branch as being stable. The development branch for documentation, `gh-pages-develop`, is also being removed. This change comes with two small side benefits: pull requests will always be against the correct branch, and it will be easy to see development activity at a glance.\r\n\r\n### New features include:\r\n- Deferred serialization for smart pointers (#185)\r\n- Initial support for C++17 standard library `variant` and `optional` (thanks to @arximboldi, #448)\r\n- Support for `std::atomic` (thanks to @bluescarni, #277)\r\n\r\n### Fixes and enhancements include:\r\n- Vastly improved continuous integration testing (#568, #569)\r\n- Fixed several issues related to compilation on newer compilers (#579, #587, #515)\r\n- Fixed warnings with `-Wconversion` and `-Wdocumentation` (thanks to @WSoptics, #423)\r\n- Performance improvements for polymorphic serialization (#354)\r\n\r\n### Minor fixes and enhancements include:\r\n- Fixed a bug related to `CEREAL_REGISTER_DYNAMIC_INIT` with shared libraries (thanks to @M2tM, #523)\r\n- Avoid unnecessary undefined behavior with `StaticObject` (thanks to @erichkeane, #470)\r\n- New `version.hpp` file describes cereal version (#444)\r\n- Ability to disable `size=dynamic` attribute in the XML archive (thanks to @hoensr, #401)\r\n\r\n### Other Notes\r\n- The static checking for `minimal` serialization has been relaxed as there were many legitimate cases it was interfering with (thanks to @h-2, #565)\r\n- The `vs2013` directory has been removed in favor of generating solutions with CMake (#574)\r\n\r\nThis is not an exhaustive list of changes or individual contributions.

Whenever you serialize a smart pointer to a polymorphic type, cereal must be able to find a path from the derived type to the base type. cereal is able to do this automatically if you serialize the base class using `cereal::base_class` or `cereal::virtual_base_class`. If you do not do this, you must explicitly tell cereal about the relationship using the new macro `CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION`, found in `<cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp>`.\n- `std::bitset` has been optimized for binary archives to avoid conversion to a string representation (see #236, thanks to @lyager). As a result of this, any bitset long enough to previously use the string output will not be compatible with the new serialization. \n\n### Known Issues\n\nThere is currently an error in the compile-time type checking that cereal performs on non-member `load_minimal` functions that will cause a `static_assertion` to mistakenly prevent compilation from succeeding.  This only affects users using non-member `load_minimal` functions where the type to support `load_minimal` requires an unknown template parameter.  See #132 for more information and workarounds.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1389987","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1389987/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1389987/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/releases/tag/v1.1.2","id":1389987,"author":{"login":"AzothAmmo","id":1634639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AzothAmmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEzODk5ODc=","tag_name":"v1.1.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"cereal v 1.1.2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-06-08T18:14:05Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T18:19:18Z","published_at":"2015-06-08T18:19:18Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/tarball/v1.1.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/zipball/v1.1.2","body":"## This is a minor release for cereal\n\n### New Features\n- Added support for std::valarray (thanks to @ilerik, #184)\n\n### Minor fixes and enhancements include:\n- Fixed an issue with partial matching for NVP lookup (#167)\n\nSee the [closed issues](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v+1.1.2%22+is%3Aclosed) for more information.\n\nTo see what else is upcoming in the next release, check out [milestone 1.2](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/milestones/v1.2.0).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1126540","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1126540/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/1126540/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/releases/tag/v1.1.1","id":1126540,"author":{"login":"AzothAmmo","id":1634639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AzothAmmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTExMjY1NDA=","tag_name":"v1.1.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"cereal v1.1.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-04-06T17:22:02Z","updated_at":"2015-04-06T17:23:24Z","published_at":"2015-04-06T17:23:24Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/tarball/v1.1.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/zipball/v1.1.1","body":"## This is a minor bug fix release for cereal\n\nWe're moving to more rapid intermediate releases between feature versions of cereal to make it easier for users to take advantage of bug fixes and various improvements.  Although these fixes were and will continue to be available in the develop branch, many users are more comfortable using an official released version.\n\n### Minor fixes and enhancements include:\n- Compliance with MSVC warning level 4 (#151, #178)\n- Bug fixes related to tuples (thanks to @eschnett and @erichkeane, #175, #176)\n- Empty string fixes for XML archives (#182)\n- Fixes related to polymorphism and serialization function specialization (#180)\n\nSee the [closed issues](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v+1.1.1%22+is%3Aclosed) for more information.\n\n### Potential Breaking Changes\n\nIn fixing #180, the type traits `is_input_serializable` and `is_output_serializable` were changed to accurately reflect their names.  Prior to this release, these traits would return false if a type had more than one serialization function but was restricted to use only one of them through specialization.  With this release, these traits base their decision on whether a type is either specialized for exactly one serialization method or has exactly one non-specialized serialization method available.  If you relied on the previous (incorrect) behavior in any custom type traits, you may need to make appropriate changes.\n\n### Upcoming Changes\n\nWe next plan to fix some compilation issues with NVCC for users of cuda 7.0 and then move on to core 1.2 features, which will mainly focus on modules and various enhancements to cereal.\n\nTo see what else is upcoming in the next release, check out [milestone 1.2](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/milestones/v1.2.0).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/258105","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/258105/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/258105/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/releases/tag/v1.1.0","id":258105,"author":{"login":"AzothAmmo","id":1634639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AzothAmmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI1ODEwNQ==","tag_name":"v1.1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"cereal v1.1.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-02-04T18:41:38Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T18:41:29Z","published_at":"2015-01-19T21:00:37Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/tarball/v1.1.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/zipball/v1.1.0","body":"## This is a minor feature and bug fix release for cereal.\n\nThis is our first release since 1.0, and the first release with significant contribution from the community, which will only increase with 1.2.  cereal would like to thank its users and contributors for helping make this release possible.\n\n### Notable changes include:\n- cereal serialization functions (e.g. load/save/serialize) can now be easily renamed via macros in `cereal/macros.hpp` (thanks to @mattyclarkson, #60)\n- XML archives properly handle whitespace in text (thanks to @volo-zyko, #109)\n- Class versioning and polymorphic registration work properly with shared libraries (thanks in part to @ImplOfAnImpl, #113, #137)\n\n### Minor fixes and enhancements include:\n- Fixed issues related to long serialization on OSX using libc++ (#81)\n- Fixed support of char serialization for XML archives (#116)\n- Fixes and enhancements related to minimal serialization (#79, #80)\n- Properly utilizing R-values in various internal containers (#96)\n- Improved support for ICC (Intel C++ compiler) (#120)\n- Tuple elements are now serialized in proper order with unique names in text archives (thanks in part to @erichkeane, #143).  See breaking changes for a special note on this.\n- Additional miscellaneous bug fixes and code refactoring.\n\nSee the [closed issues](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues?milestone=3&page=1&state=closed) for more information.\n\n### Breaking Changes:\n\nThis release introduces two breaking changes.  The first will affect any user that created a custom serialization archive and utilizes minimal serialization functions with that archive:\n\nIn fixing #79, we introduced the concept of relating input and output archives using type traits.  You now need to use the macro `CEREAL_SETUP_ARCHIVE_TRAITS(InArchive, OutArchive)` for your custom archives if you wish to support minimal serialization.  You can look at the source of any of the cereal provided archives to see an example of this.\n\nIn addition, in fixing #80, we introduced a traits class that text based archives should inherit from.  This has been applied to JSON and XML archives, but any users with custom text based archives are encouraged to have their text archive inherit from `cereal::traits::TextArchive`.  This is not currently used internally by cereal but may be used by users with the new `cereal::traits::is_text_archive` traits class.\n\nThe second breaking change has to do with tuple serialization.  We fixed the order of tuple serialization to go in ascending (`get<0>(), get<1>()`) instead of descending order.  See #143 for more information.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nThere is currently an error in the compile-time type checking that cereal performs on non-member `load_minimal` functions that will cause a `static_assertion` to mistakenly prevent compilation from succeeding.  This only affects users using non-member `load_minimal` functions where the type to support `load_minimal` requires an unknown template parameter.  See #132 for more information and workarounds.  This is scheduled to be fixed in the next release.\n\nVarious cereal macros such as `CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE` do not work properly when used with templated class arguments (e.g. `MyClass<OtherType>`).  You can use a typedef (e.g. `using SingleName = MyClass<OtherType>`) to avoid the issue.  See #141 for the future solution we will use.\n\n### Upcoming Changes\n\nThe next version of cereal will introduce cereal modules, which will be collections of serialization functions or archives for types outside of the standard library.  These will exist outside of the main cereal distribution to avoid cluttering the core of cereal.  See https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/labels/module for more information.\n\nTo see what else is upcoming in the next release, check out [milestone 1.2](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/milestones/v1.2.0).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/129036","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/129036/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/129036/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/releases/tag/v1.0.0","id":129036,"author":{"login":"AzothAmmo","id":1634639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AzothAmmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEyOTAzNg==","tag_name":"v1.0.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"cereal v1.0.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2014-03-22T00:04:30Z","updated_at":"2014-03-22T00:06:55Z","published_at":"2014-03-22T00:06:55Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/tarball/v1.0.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/zipball/v1.0.0","body":"This is a major feature release for cereal.

It passes unit tests and simulated endian swaps)\n- GCC 4.7.3 is supported as the minimum GCC version\n- Supports compiling using libc++\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/7815","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/7815/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/releases/7815/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/releases/tag/v0.9.0","id":7815,"author":{"login":"AzothAmmo","id":1634639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AzothAmmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzothAmmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTc4MTU=","tag_name":"v0.9.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"cereal v0.9.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2013-07-11T19:43:18Z","updated_at":"2013-07-11T19:43:29Z","published_at":"2013-07-10T20:10:51Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/tarball/v0.9.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/USCiLab/cereal/zipball/v0.9.0","body":"This is the initial release of cereal.\n"}]
