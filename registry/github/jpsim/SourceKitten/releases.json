For example, commands such as\r\n  `sourcekitten --help` or `sourcekitten -h` now work as expected.\r\n  The help output from various commands has greatly improved as well.\r\n  A few notable breaking changes:\r\n    * `doc --spm-module` was removed (use `--spm --module-name` instead)\r\n    * `sourcekitten module_info` is now `sourcekitten module-info`  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n##### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n##### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Always bypass codesigning when building Xcode projects.  \r\n  [John
