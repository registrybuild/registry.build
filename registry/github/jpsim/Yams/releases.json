Along with that change, add `encoding`\r\n  options to `load()`, `load_all()`, `compose()`, `compose_all()` and \r\n  `YAMLDecoder`. The default encoding will be determined at run time based on\r\n  the String type's native encoding.  \r\n  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)\r\n\r\n##### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/16482899","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/16482899/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/16482899/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jpsim/Yams/releases/tag/1.0.2","id":16482899,"author":{"login":"jpsim","id":474794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDc5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/474794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim","html_url":"https://github.com/jpsim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2NDgyODk5","tag_name":"1.0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-04-01T17:53:01Z","published_at":"2019-04-01T17:53:55Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/tarball/1.0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/zipball/1.0.2","body":"##### Breaking\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n##### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Update LibYAML sources to latest versions as of January 6 2018.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n##### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix some test failures with the latest Swift 5 snapshot on Apple platforms.  \r\n  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)\r\n  [#143](https://github.com/jpsim/Yams/issues/143)\r\n\r\n* Preserve nanoseconds in dates when using swift-corelibs-foundation with\r\n  Swift 5.  \r\n  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)\r\n  [#146](https://github.com/jpsim/Yams/pull/146)\r\n\r\n* Fix null/~/NULL/Null were parsed as strings, not nil by `YAMLDecoder`.  \r\n  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)\r\n  [#157](https://github.com/jpsim/Yams/issues/157)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/12662657","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/12662657/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/releases/12662657/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jpsim/Yams/releases/tag/1.0.1","id":12662657,"author":{"login":"jpsim","id":474794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDc5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/474794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim","html_url":"https://github.com/jpsim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpsim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEyNjYyNjU3","tag_name":"1.0.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-08-30T20:27:59Z","published_at":"2018-08-30T20:29:33Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/tarball/1.0.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jpsim/Yams/zipball/1.0.1","body":"##### Breaking\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n##### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Improve support for compiling with Swift 4.2 or later.  \r\n  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)\r\n\r\n##### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issues with unset `DYLIB_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` and\r\n  `DYLIB_CURRENT_VERSION`.
