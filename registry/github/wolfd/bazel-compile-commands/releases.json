https://github.com/danny-skydio/bazel-compile-commands/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements from @aaron-skydio:\r\n- Switching to proto vs jsonproto by default.\r\n- Only visit each depset once per top-level artifact (this saves a few minutes in our repo).\r\n- Cache JSON encoding of command-line arguments so that headers that share the same command as source files aren't incurring too much additional load.\r\n- Reduce largely duplicate entries by not emitting in initial CppCompile loop. We have not observed issues with this new technique, but it's possible this may not work in some cases.\r\n\r\nMisc improvements from @aaron-skydio:\r\n- Added debugging args to save/load aquery output.\r\n- Added argument to switch from proto to jsonproto parsing.\r\n- Added a default query (produce output for everything except for manual targets).\r\n- Allow for excluded args to be regexes.\r\n\r\nMisc improvements:\r\n- If argcomplete or tqdm are available, we provide enable some extra features. This is not wired up in this repo, so you may need to patch in those libraries if you want them.","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/releases/134671517","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/releases/134671517/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/releases/134671517/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/releases/tag/v0.3.0","id":134671517,"author":{"login":"danny-skydio","id":79167967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTY3OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79167967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio","html_url":"https://github.com/danny-skydio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny-skydio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOKEjNys4IBuyd","tag_name":"v0.3.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"v0.3.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-12-06T22:34:27Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T22:32:22Z","published_at":"2023-12-20T18:11:26Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/tarball/v0.3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wolfd/bazel-compile-commands/zipball/v0.3.0","body":"`WORKSPACE`:\r\n```bazel\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\",
