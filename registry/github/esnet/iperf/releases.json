(CVE-2024-53580) This has now been\r\n                     fixed. (PR#1810)\r\n\r\n    * UDP packets per second now reports the correct number of\r\n      packets, by reporting NET_SOFTERROR if there's a EAGAIN/EINTR\r\n      errno if no data was sent (#1367/PR#1379).\r\n\r\n    * Several segmentation faults related to threading were fixed. One\r\n      where `pthread_cancel` was called on an improperly initialized\r\n      thread (#1801), another where threads were being recycled\r\n      (#1760/PR#1761), and another where threads were improperly\r\n      handling signals (#1750/PR#1752).\r\n\r\n    * A segmentation fault from calling `freeaddrinfo` with `NULL` was\r\n      fixed (PR#1755).\r\n\r\n    * Some JSON options were fixed, including checking the size for\r\n      `json_read` (PR#1709), but the size limit was removed for\r\n      received server output (PR#1779).\r\n\r\n    * A rcv-timeout error has been fixed. The Nread timeout was\r\n      hardcoded and timed out before the `--rcv-timeout` option\r\n      (PR#1744).\r\n\r\n    * There is no longer a limit on the omit time period\r\n      (#1770/PR#1774).\r\n\r\n    * Fixed an output crash under 32-bit big-endian systems (PR#1713).\r\n\r\n    * An issue was fixed where CPU utilization was unexpectedly high\r\n      during limited baud rate tests. The `--pacing-timer` option was\r\n      removed, but it is still available in the library\r\n      (#1741/PR#1743).\r\n\r\n    * Add SCTP information to `--json` output and fixed compile error\r\n      when SCTP is not supported (#1731).\r\n\r\n    * `--fq-rate` was changed from a uint to a uint64 to allow pacing above\r\n      32G.  Not yet tested on big-endian systems (PR#1728).\r\n\r\n* Notable developer-visible changes\r\n\r\n    * Clang compilation failure on Android were fixed (PR#1687).\r\n\r\n    * `iperf_time_add()` was optimizated to improve performance\r\n      (PR#1742).\r\n\r\n    * Debug messages were added when the state changes (PR#1734).\r\n\r\n    * To increase performance, the old UDP `prot_listener` is cleared\r\n      and removed after each test (PR#1708).\r\n\r\n    * A file descriptor leak was closed

To address this flaw, a change has been made to the\r\n    padding applied to encrypted strings. This change is not backwards\r\n    compatible with older versions of iperf3 (before 3.17). To restore\r\n    the older (vulnerable) behavior, and hence\r\n    backwards-compatibility, use the --use-pkcs1-padding flag. The\r\n    iperf3 team thanks Hubert Kario from RedHat for reporting this\r\n    issue and providing feedback on the fix. (CVE-2024-26306)(PR#1695)\r\n\r\n  * iperf3 no longer changes its current working directory in --daemon\r\n    mode. This results in more predictable behavior with relative\r\n    paths, in particular finding key and credential files for\r\n    authentication. (PR#1672)\r\n\r\n  * A new --json-stream option has been added to enable a streaming\r\n    output format, consisting of a series of JSON objects (for the\r\n    start of the test, each measurement interval, and the end of the\r\n    test) separated by newlines (#444, #923, #1098).\r\n\r\n  * UDP tests now work correctly between different endian hosts\r\n    (#1415).\r\n\r\n  * The --fq-rate parameter now works for --reverse tests (#1632, PR#1667).\r\n\r\n  * The statistics reporting interval is now available in the --json\r\n    start test object (#1663).\r\n\r\n  * A negative time test duration is now properly flagged as an error\r\n    (IS#1662 / PR#1666).\r\n\r\n* Notable developer-visible changes\r\n\r\n  * Fixes have been made to better (unofficially) support builds on\r\n    Android (#1641 / #1651) and VxWorks (#1595).\r\n\r\n  * iperf3 now builds correctly on architectures without native\r\n    support for 64-bit atomic types, by linking with the libatomic\r\n    library
