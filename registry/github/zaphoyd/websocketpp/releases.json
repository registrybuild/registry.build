This demonstrates a minimal non-TLS\r\n  client that connects to a server and prints out the messages it receives.\r\n- **Examples**: Add `print_client_tls` example. This demonstrates a minimal TLS\r\n  client, including basic support via Asio+OpenSSL for certificate chain\r\n  and hostname verification.\r\n- **Feature**: Add getter for all headers to the HTTP parsers. This allows a\r\n  wrapping library to enumerate all headers to send upstream. Thank you Jupp\r\n  MÃ¼ller for reporting and an initial pull request.\r\n- **Improvement**: Move the `socket_init_handler` to execute as a part of `init_asio`\r\n  rather than connection `pre_init`. This allows setting of socket options prior\r\n  to the bind/listen/accept system calls. Thank you ChristianRobl3D for\r\n  reporting #530.\r\n- **Improvement**: Timers in transport integration tests should only fail if their\r\n  own test times out, rather than any test. #643 Thank you Alex Korotkin for\r\n  reporting and a patch.\r\n- **Improvement**: Preserve transport layer error codes in more cases, particularly\r\n  during calls to `endpoint::listen`. #652 Thank you vadz for reporting and\r\n  patches.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Make sure the chrono library used by Boost/Asio is in sync\r\n  with what the websocketpp is using. Thank you Flow86 for reporting and a\r\n  patch.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Update `telemetry_client` to use a slightly more cross platform\r\n  method of sleeping. Should work on windows now. Thank you Meir Yanovich for\r\n  reporting.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Updated permessage-deflate support to reflect that the zlib\r\n  library does not actually support a sliding window size of 256 bits. \r\n  WebSocket++ will no longer negotiate 256 bit deflate windows. If the user\r\n  of the library tries to request a 256 bit window a 512 bit window will be\r\n  specified instead (This was the previous behavior). #596 #653 Thank you \r\n  Vinnie Falco and Gianfranco Costamagna for reporting.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Better error handling and logging in cases where extension\r\n  requests parse correctly but negotiation fails.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Removed custom handling of `SSL_R_SHORT_READ` error condition.\r\n  This error code no longer exists in modern versions of OpenSSL and causes\r\n  a build error. It wasn't being used for anything particularly important\r\n  (slightly improving error reporting) and there isn't a great replacement.\r\n  #599 Thank you Gianfranco Costamagna for reporting.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Add missing `<stdint>` headers. Fixes issues with g++ 5.4.0.\r\n  #638 Thank you Alex Korotkin for reporting and a patch.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Remove the use of `std::auto_ptr` and `std::binary_function`\r\n  from builds with C++11 or later. These features are deprecated and were\r\n  removed entirely in C++17. This change allows building WebSocket++ on\r\n  C++17 compilers. #592 Thank you Michal Fojtak for reporting and a patch\r\n- **Compatibility**: Add 1014 close code and adds missing descriptions for codes\r\n  1012 and 1013. #589 Thank you jbwdevries and ronneke1996 for reporting and\r\n  patches.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Add hooks to support `mingw-std-threads` C++11 thread and mutex\r\n  polyfill library as an alternative to Boost. #608 Thank you Peter Taylor for\r\n  reporting and an initial patch.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Changed the handshake connection token to 'Upgrade' from\r\n  'upgrade'. Technically this header is supposed to be processed case\r\n  insensitively. In practice, there are browsers (such as Edge) that don't do\r\n  this and they tend to use the uppercase value used as an example in RFC6455.\r\n  Thank you Johann Bauer for reporting and a patch. #727\r\n- **Bug**: Store loggers in shared pointers to avoid crashes related to connections\r\n  trying to write logs entries after their respective endpoint has been\r\n  deallocated. Thank you Thalhammer for reporting and Jupp MÃ¼ller for the \r\n  patch. #539 #501\r\n- **Bug**: Change default listen backlog from 0 to `socket_base::max_connections`.\r\n  #549. Thank you derwassi and zwelab for reporting and na1pir for providing\r\n  access to hardware to debug the issue.\r\n- **Bug**: Fix a crash in the accept loop when `get_connection` fails. #551 Thank you\r\n  Walter Gray for a patch.\r\n- **Bug/Documentation**: Fix incorrect example code that used \r\n  `websocketpp::lib::error_code` instead of `websocketpp::exception`. Thank you\r\n  heretic13 for reporting\r\n- **Bug**: Fix uninitialized shared pointer in Asio transport test suite. #647\r\n  Thank you Alex Korotkin for reporting and a patch.\r\n- **Bug**: Fix a thread safety issue in the permessage-deflate extension that\r\n  caused message corruption when sending compressed messages from a different\r\n  thread than the main I/O thread. #615 Thank you KyleNyenhuis and Pieter De \r\n  Gendt for reporting and a patch.\r\n- **Bug**: Fix an undefined behavior issue performing a 64 bit wide shift on a 64\r\n  bit value. #636 Thank you Gregor Jasny for reporting and a patch\r\n- **Bug**: Fix some compile issues with ASIO_STANDALONE. #662 #665 Thank you\r\n  chronoxor and Guillaume Egles for reporting and patches."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/2662234","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/2662234/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/2662234/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.7.0","id":2662234,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI2NjIyMzQ=","tag_name":"0.7.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"WebSocket++/0.7.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-02-22T13:30:10Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T13:42:15Z","published_at":"2016-02-22T13:42:15Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.7.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.7.0","body":"- **MINOR BREAKING SOCKET POLICY CHANGE**: Asio transport socket policy method `cancel_socket` will now return `lib::asio::error_code` instead of `void`. Custom Asio transport socket policies will need to be updated accordingly. This does not affect anyone using the bundled socket policies.\n- **Feature**: Basic support for the permessage-deflate extension. #344\n- **Feature**: Allow accessing the local endpoint when using the Asio transport. This allows inspection of the address and port in cases where they are chosen by the operating system rather than the user. Thank you Andreas Weis and Muzahid Hussain for reporting and related code. #458\n- **Feature**: Add support for subprotocols in Hybi00. Thank you Lukas Obermann for reporting and a patch. #518\n- **Improvement**: Better automatic std::chrono feature detection for Visual Studio\n- **Improvement**: Major refactoring to bundled CMake build system. CMake can now be used to build all of the examples and the test suite. Thank you Thijs Wenker for a significant portion of this code. #378, #435, #449\n- **Improvement**: In build environments where `lib::error_code` and `lib::asio::error_code` match (such as using `boost::asio` with `boost::system_error` or standalone asio with `std::system_error`, transport errors are passed through natively rather than being reported as a translated  `pass_through` error type.\n- **Improvement**: Add a `get_transport_error` method to Asio transport connections to allow retrieving a machine readable native transport error.\n- **Improvement**: Add `connection::get_response`, `connection::get_response_code`, and `connection::get_response_msg` methods to allow accessing additional information about the HTTP responses that WebSocket++ sends. #465 Thank youFlow86 for reporting.\n- **Improvement**: Removes use of empty strings (\"\") in favor of `string::clear()` and `string::empty()`. This avoids generating unnecessary temporary objects. #468 Thank you Vladislav Yaroslavlev for reporting and a patch.\n- **Documentation**: Adds an example demonstrating the use of external `io_service`\n- **Documentation**: Adds a simple echo_client example.\n- **Documentation**: Begins migration of the web based user manual into Doxygen.\n- **Bug**: Fix memory leak when init_asio produces an error. #454 Thank you Mark Grimes for reporting and fixing.\n- **Bug**: Fix crash when processing a specially crafted HTTP header. Thank you Eli Fidler for reporting, test cases, and a patch. #456\n- **Bug**: Fix an issue where standalone Asio builds that use TLS would not compile due to lingering boost code. #448 Thank you mjsp for reporting\n- **Bug**: Fix an issue where canceling a socket could throw an exception on some older Windows XP platforms. It now prints an appropriate set of log messages instead. Thank you Thijs Wenker for reporting and researching solutions. #460\n- **Bug**: Fix an issue where deferred HTTP connections that start sending a very  long response before their HTTP handler ends would result in a second set of HTTP headers being injected into the output. Thank you Kevin Smith for reporting and providing test case details. #443\n- **Bug**: Fix an issue where the wrong type of strand was being created. Thank you Bastien Brunnenstein for reporting and a patch. #462\n- **Bug**: Fix an issue where TLS includes were broken for Asio Standalone builds. Thank you giachi and Bastien Brunnenstein for reporting. #491\n- **Bug**: Remove the use of cached read and write handlers in the Asio transport. This feature caused memory leaks when the io_service the connection was running on was abruptly stopped. There isn't a clean and safe way of using this optimization without global state and the associated locks. The locks perform worse. Thank you Xavier Gibert for reporting, test cases, and code. Fixes #490.\n- **Bug**: Fix a heap buffer overflow when checking very short URIs. Thank you Xavier Gibert for reporting and a patch #524\n- **Compatibility**: Fixes a number of build & config issues on Visual Studio 2015\n- **Compatibility**: Removes non-standards compliant masking behavior. #395, #469\n- **Compatibility**: Replace deprecated use of auto_ptr on systems where unique_ptr is available.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/1386397","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/1386397/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/1386397/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.6.0-permessage-deflate","id":1386397,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEzODYzOTc=","tag_name":"0.6.0-permessage-deflate","target_commitish":"permessage-deflate","name":"WebSocket++/0.6.0-permessage-deflate","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2015-06-03T13:21:06Z","updated_at":"2015-06-07T20:48:07Z","published_at":"2015-06-07T20:48:07Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.6.0-permessage-deflate","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.6.0-permessage-deflate","body":"This is a companion release to WebSocket++/0.6.0 with support for the upcoming permessage-deflate WebSocket compression extension.

An implementation\n  is not required. The stub transport policy includes an example stub method\n  that can be added to any existing custom transport policy to fulfill this\n  requirement. This does not affect anyone using the bundled transports or\n  configs.\n- **MINOR BREAKING SOCKET POLICY CHANGE**: Custom asio transport socket policies \n  will now be required to include a new method `void set_uri(uri_ptr u)`. Like\n  with the transport layer, an implementation is not required. This does not \n  affect anyone using the bundled socket policies.\n- **MINOR BREAKING DEPENDENCY CHANGE**: When using Boost versions greater than or \n  equal to 1.49 in C++03 mode, `libboost-chrono` is needed now instead of \n  `libboost-date_time`. Users with C++11 compilers or using Boost versions 1.48\n  and earlier are not affected. Note: This change affects the bundled unit test\n  suite.\n- **Feature**: WebSocket++ Asio transport policy can now be used with the standalone\n  version of Asio (1.8.0+) when a C++11 compiler and standard library are \n  present. This means that it is possible now to use WebSocket++'s Asio\n  transport entirely without Boost. Thank you Robert Seiler for proof of concept\n  code that was used as a guide for this implementation. Fixes #324 \n- **Feature**: Adds a vectored/scatter-gather write handler to the iostream\n  transport.\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to defer sending an HTTP response until sometime\n  after the `http_handler` is run. This allows processing of long running http\n  handlers to defer their response until it is ready without blocking the\n  network thread. references #425\n- **Improvement**: `echo_server_tls` has been update to demonstrate how to configure\n  it for Mozilla's recommended intermediate and modern TLS security profiles.\n- **Improvement**: `endpoint::set_timer` now uses a steady clock provided by \n  `boost::chrono` or `std::chrono` where available instead of the non-monotonic\n  system clock. Thank you breyed for reporting. fixes #241\n- **Improvement**: Outgoing TLS connections to servers using the SNI extension to\n  choose a certificate will now work. Thank you moozzyk for reporting. \n  Fixes #400\n- **Improvement**: Removes an unnecessary mutex lock in `get_con_from_hdl`.\n- **Cleanup**: Asio transport policy has been refactored to remove many Boost\n  dependencies. On C++03 compilers the `boost::noncopyable` dependency has been\n  removed and the `boost::date_time` dependency has been replaced with the newer\n  `boost::chrono` when possible. On C++11 compilers the `boost::aligned_storage`\n  and `boost::date_time` dependencies are gone, replaced with equivalent C++11\n  standard library features.\n- **Bug**: Fixes a potential dangling pointer and inconsistent error message\n  handling in `websocketpp::exception`. #432 Thank you Tom Swirly for the fix.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/995370","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/995370/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/995370/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.5.1","id":995370,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTk5NTM3MA==","tag_name":"0.5.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"WebSocket++/0.5.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-02-27T14:51:47Z","updated_at":"2015-02-27T14:53:40Z","published_at":"2015-02-27T14:52:53Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.5.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.5.1","body":"- **Bug**: Fixes an issue where some frame data was counted against the max header\n  size limit, resulting in connections that included a lot of frame data\n  immediately after the opening handshake to fail.\n- **Bug**: Fix a typo in the name of the set method for `max_http_body_size`. #406\n  Thank you jplatte for reporting.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/875053","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/875053/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/875053/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.5.0","id":875053,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTg3NTA1Mw==","tag_name":"0.5.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"WebSocket++/0.5.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-01-22T14:56:40Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T15:25:03Z","published_at":"2015-01-22T15:25:03Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.5.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.5.0","body":"- **BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE**: Deprecated methods `http::parser::parse_headers`,\n  `http::response::parse_complete`, and `http::request::parse_complete` have\n  been removed.\n- **Security**: Disabled SSLv3 in example servers.\n- **Feature**: Adds basic support for accessing HTTP request bodies in the http\n  handler. #181\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to register a shutdown handler when using the\n  iostream transport. This provides a clean interface for triggering the shut\n  down of external sockets and other cleanup without hooking in to higher level\n  WebSocket handlers.\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to register a write handler when using the iostream\n  transport. This handler can be used to handle transport output in place of\n  registering an ostream to write to.\n- **Feature**: Adds a new logging policy that outputs to syslog. #386 Thank you Tom\n  Hughes for submitting the initial version of this policy.\n- **Improvement**: Message payload logging now prints text for text messages rather\n  than binary.\n- **Improvement:** Overhaul of handshake state machine. Should make it impossible\n  for exceptions to bubble out of transport methods like `io_service::run`.\n- **Improvement:** Overhaul of handshake error reporting. Fail handler error codes\n  will be more detailed and precise. Adds new [fail] and [http] logging channels\n  that log failed websocket connections and successful HTTP connections\n  respectively. A new aggregate channel package, `alevel::access_core`, allows\n  enabling connect, disconnect, fail, and http together. Successful HTTP\n  connections will no longer trigger a fail handler.\n- **Improvement:** Ability to terminate connection during an http handler to cleanly\n  suppress the default outgoing HTTP response.\n- **Documentation:** Add Sending & Receiving Messages step to chapter one of the\n  `utility_client` tutorial. Update `utility_client` example to match.\n- **Cleanup:** Removes unused files & STL includes. Adds required STL includes.\n  Normalizes include order.\n- **Bug:** Fixes a fatal state error when a handshake response is completed\n  immediately after that handshake times out. #389\n- **Bug:** MinGW fixes; C++11 feature detection, localtime use. #393 Thank you\n  Schebb for reporting, code, and testing.\n- **Bug:** Fixes an issue where `websocketpp::exception::what()` could return an out\n  of scope pointer. #397 Thank you fabioang for reporting.\n- **Bug:** Fixes an issue where endpoints were not reset properly after a call to\n  `endpoint::listen` failed. #390 Thank you wyyqyl for reporting.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/676671","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/676671/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/676671/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.4.0","id":676671,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTY3NjY3MQ==","tag_name":"0.4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"WebSocket++/0.4.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2014-11-04T12:35:10Z","updated_at":"2014-11-04T12:53:49Z","published_at":"2014-11-04T12:53:49Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.4.0","body":"- **BREAKING API CHANGE**: All WebSocket++ methods now throw an exception of type\n  `websocketpp::exception` which derives from `std::exception`. This normalizes\n  all exception types under the standard exception hierarchy and allows\n  WebSocket++ exceptions to be caught in the same statement as others. The error\n  code that was previously thrown is wrapped in the exception object and can be\n  accessed via the `websocketpp::exception::code()` method.\n- **BREAKING API CHANGE**: Custom logging policies have some new required\n  constructors that take generic config settings rather than pointers to\n  std::ostreams. This allows writing logging policies that do not involve the\n  use of std::ostream. This does not affect anyone using the built in logging\n  policies.\n- **BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE**: `websocketpp::lib::net::htonll` and\n  `websocketpp::lib::net::ntohll` have been prefixed with an underscore to avoid\n  conflicts with similarly named macros in some operating systems. If you are\n  using the WebSocket++ provided 64 bit host/network byte order functions you\n  will need to switch to the prefixed versions.\n- **BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE**: The signature of `base64_encode` has changed from\n  `websocketpp::base64_encode(unsigned char const *, unsigned int)` to\n  `websocketpp::base64_encode(unsigned char const *, size_t)`.\n- **BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE**: The signature of `sha1::calc` has changed from\n  `websocketpp::sha1::calc(void const *, int, unsigned char *)` to\n  `websocketpp::sha1::calc(void const *, size_t, unsigned char *)`\n- **Feature**: Adds incomplete `minimal_server` and `minimal_client` configs that\n  can be used to build custom configs without pulling in the dependencies of\n  `core` or `core_client`. These configs will offer a stable base config to\n  future-proof custom configs.\n- **Improvement**: Core library no longer has std::iostream as a dependency.\n  std::iostream is still required for the optional iostream logging policy and\n  iostream transport.\n- **Bug**: C++11 Chrono support was being incorrectly detected by the `boost_config`\n  header. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting and a patch.\n- **Bug**: use of `std::put_time` is now guarded by a unique flag rather than a\n  chrono library flag. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting.\n- **Bug**: Fixes non-thread safe use of std::localtime. #347 #383\n- **Compatibility**: Adjust usage of std::min to be more compatible with systems\n  that define a min(...) macro.\n- **Compatibility**: Removes unused parameters from all library, test, and example\n  code. This assists with those developing with -Werror and -Wunused-parameter\n  #376\n- **Compatibility**: Renames ntohll and htonll methods to avoid conflicts with\n  platform specific macros. #358 #381, #382 Thank you logotype, unphased,\n  svendjo\n- **Cleanup**: Removes unused functions, fixes variable shadow warnings, normalizes\n  all whitespace in library, examples, and tests to 4 spaces. #376\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/481395","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/481395/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/481395/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.3.0","id":481395,"author":{"login":"zaphoyd","id":1006976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd","html_url":"https://github.com/zaphoyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaphoyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ4MTM5NQ==","tag_name":"0.3.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"WebSocket++/0.3.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2014-08-09T19:08:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-09T19:14:33Z","published_at":"2014-08-09T19:14:33Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tarball/0.3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaphoyd/websocketpp/zipball/0.3.0","body":"- **Feature**: Adds `start_perpetual` and `stop_perpetual` methods to asio transport\n  These may be used to replace manually managed `asio::io_service::work` objects\n- **Feature**: Allow setting pong and handshake timeouts at runtime.\n- **Feature**: Allows changing the listen backlog queue length.\n- **Feature**: Split tcp init into pre and post init.\n- **Feature**: Adds URI method to extract query string from URI. Thank you Banaan\n  for code. #298\n- **Feature**: Adds a compile time switch to asio transport config to disable\n  certain multithreading features (some locks, asio strands)\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to pause reading on a connection. Paused connections\n  will not read more data from their socket, allowing TCP flow control to work\n  without blocking the main thread.\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to specify whether or not to use the `SO_REUSEADDR`\n  TCP socket option. The default for this value has been changed from `true` to\n  `false`.\n- **Feature**: Adds the ability to specify a maximum message size.\n- **Feature**: Adds `close::status::get_string(...)` method to look up a human\n  readable string given a close code value.\n- **Feature**: Adds `connection::read_all(...)` method to iostream transport as a\n  convenience method for reading all data into the connection buffer without the\n  end user needing to manually loop on `read_some`.\n- **Improvement**: Open, close, and pong timeouts can be disabled entirely by\n  setting their duration to 0.\n- **Improvement**: Numerous performance improvements. Including: tuned default\n  buffer sizes based on profiling, caching of handler binding for async\n  reads/writes, non-malloc allocators for read/write handlers, disabling of a\n  number of questionably useful range sanity checks in tight inner loops.\n- **Improvement**: Cleaned up the handling of TLS related errors. TLS errors will\n  now be reported with more detail on the info channel rather than all being\n  `tls_short_read` or `pass_through`. In addition, many cases where a TLS short\n  read was in fact expected are no longer classified as errors. Expected TLS\n  short reads and quasi-expected socket shutdown related errors will no longer\n  be reported as unclean WebSocket shutdowns to the application. Information\n  about them will remain in the info error channel for debugging purposes.\n- **Improvement**: `start_accept` and `listen` errors are now reported to the caller\n  either via an exception or an ec parameter.\n- **Improvement**: Outgoing writes are now batched for improved message throughput\n  and reduced system call and TCP frame overhead.\n- **Bug**: Fix some cases of calls to empty lib::function objects.\n- **Bug**: Fix memory leak of connection objects due to cached handlers holding on to\n  reference counted pointers. #310 Thank you otaras for reporting.\n- **Bug**: Fix issue with const endpoint accessors (such as `get_user_agent`) not\n  compiling due to non-const mutex use. #292 Thank you logofive for reporting.\n- **Bug**: Fix handler allocation crash with multithreaded `io_service`.\n- **Bug**: Fixes incorrect whitespace handling in header parsing. #301 Thank you\n  Wolfram Schroers for reporting\n- **Bug**: Fix a crash when parsing empty HTTP headers.
