issues on this mailing list or the GitHub issue\r\ntracker at https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nFirst, we apologize for the extended time this release has taken. We wanted to ensure proper ABI compatibility and testing.\r\n\r\nMajor Changes:\r\n\r\n    ABI/API Versioning:\r\n        API version remains at 3.x as the API is stable\r\n        SO version increased from 3 to 4 due to ABI issues introduced in 3.11.0 and 3.14.2\r\n        Restored ABI compatibility to 3.10 (fixing incompatibilities introduced in 3.11 and 3.14.2)\r\n        Added automated ABI compatibility tests\r\n        Note: Currently tests only verify against previous tag, not 3.10 yet due to too many false positives.\r\n        Further improvements to the ABI testing are planned.\r\n    Version Encoding: The libfuse version is now encoded into programs at compile time using inlined functions in fuse_lowlevel.h and fuse.h\r\n    Switched to posix_spawn for better performance with memory-heavy applications and to prevent RDMA-related issues\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n\r\n    Added support for filesystem passthrough read/write when FUSE_PASSTHROUGH capability is enabled\r\n        New API: fuse_passthrough_open() and fuse_passthrough_close()\r\n        See example/passthrough_hp.cc for usage\r\n    Added fmask and dmask options to high-level API for separate permission masks for files and directories\r\n    Added signal handling with backtrace printing (fuse_set_fail_signal_handlers())\r\n    Added syslog support for fuse_log() messages\r\n        New API: fuse_log_enable_syslog() and fuse_log_close_syslog()\r\n    Added thread names to libfuse threads\r\n    Fixed buffer misalignment for FUSE_WRITE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following people have contributed

3.17.1-rc0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nFirst, we apologize for the extended time this release has taken. We wanted to ensure proper ABI compatibility and testing.\r\n\r\nMajor Changes:\r\n* ABI/API Versioning:\r\n  - API version remains at 3.x as the API is stable\r\n  - SO version increased from 3 to 4 due to ABI issues introduced in 3.11.0 and 3.14.2\r\n  - Restored ABI compatibility to 3.10 (fixing incompatibilities introduced in 3.11 and 3.14.2)\r\n  - Added automated ABI compatibility tests\r\n    Note: Currently tests only verify against previous tag, not 3.10 yet due to too many false positives.\r\n    Further improvements to the ABI testing are planned.\r\n* Version Encoding: The libfuse version is now encoded into programs at compile time using inlined functions in fuse_lowlevel.h and fuse.h\r\n* Switched to posix_spawn for better performance with memory-heavy applications and to prevent RDMA-related issues\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n* Added support for filesystem passthrough read/write when FUSE_PASSTHROUGH capability is enabled\r\n  - New API: fuse_passthrough_open() and fuse_passthrough_close()\r\n  - See example/passthrough_hp.cc for usage\r\n* Added fmask and dmask options to high-level API for separate permission masks for files and directories\r\n* Added signal handling with backtrace printing (fuse_set_fail_signal_handlers())\r\n* Added syslog support for fuse_log() messages\r\n  - New API: fuse_log_enable_syslog() and fuse_log_close_syslog()\r\n* Added thread names to libfuse threads\r\n* Fixed buffer misalignment for FUSE_WRITE","discussion_url":"https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/discussions/1123"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libfuse/libfuse/releases/124375786","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libfuse/libfuse/releases/124375786/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libfuse/libfuse/releases/124375786/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/releases/tag/fuse-3.16.2","id":124375786,"author":{"login":"Nikratio","id":701625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTYyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/701625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio","html_url":"https://github.com/Nikratio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikratio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAuDw8c4HadLq","tag_name":"fuse-3.16.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"libfuse
