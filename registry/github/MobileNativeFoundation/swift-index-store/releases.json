adds a tool for using index data to determine what imports in your files can be removed.

This means you may have to add missing imports if an import was being polluted by another otherwise unused modules. There are also a few upstream bugs in Swift that affect the accuracy of this tool, you can see the details on https://github.com/lyft/swift-index-store/issues/5.
