People should install and use much, much improved pprof implementation from github.com/google/pprof.\r\n\r\nHere is a complete list of reasonably notable changes:\r\n\r\n* [headline] heap leak checker has been amputated, as promised earlier\r\n* [headline] we don't ship pprof anymore. People need to get modern and awesome pprof implementation from github.com/google/pprof\r\n* we now have some basic CI infrastructure via Github Actions\r\n* we now have basic Bazel support\r\n* our docs have been slightly updated and converted to AsciiDoc format\r\n* we now implement C23 free{,_aligned}_sized functions (but no libc-s offer those yet anyway)\r\n* FreeBSD bits don't depend on procfs anymore (proc maps iterator was broken anyway; now it works)\r\n* we don't offer mmap profiling anymore. It wasn't entirely complete for some years now, and killing it has eliminated a lot of complexity. MMap hooks are still part of ABI, but they do nothing.\r\n\r\nPlease find the list of tickets explicitly closed by this release here:

2.16 is out!\r\n\r\nThis release doesn't have major fixes or big headline features, but it has quite a lot of internal modernizations and cleanups. By the number of commits, 2.16 is going to be our biggest release ever.\r\n\r\nThis release's main focus was making our code and building infrastructure simpler, more straightforward, more portable, and more modern.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the gperftools 2.16 release will be the last release with the heap leak checker included. The time has come to drop this feature entirely. All users should migrate to relevant gcc/clang sanitizers.\r\n\r\nHere are the most notable changes:\r\n\r\n* we've upgraded our C++ standard to C++ 17. Some fraction of our code base was modernized.\r\n\r\n* We've integrated (vendored copy of) GoogleTest, and most tests now use it. GoogleTest has helped us eliminate some legacy code and reduce the number of tests that use shell scripts.\r\n\r\n* There are no more unnecessary wrappers around mutexes and threads for unit tests. We now use C++ standard mutexes and threads in our tests.\r\n\r\n* We've done the bulk of the work necessary to enable hidden visibility. The most significant change is that tests no longer reach into libtcmalloc's guts. We use a special TestingPortal interface instead. We now offer the --enable-hidden-visibility configure option, which does what it says. But please note that hidden visibility is off by default for now.\r\n\r\n* autotools build was significantly refactored, modernized and simplified.\r\n\r\n* The cmake build has also been radically simplified. The previous version attempted to duplicate the same complexity that we had in the autotools build and did not do it very well. More tests now pass under cmake. But please note that cmake support is still not entirely functional, and we're not yet able to promise anything about it.\r\n\r\n* Thread-local storage access and emergency malloc integration have been reworked. We now support emergency malloc even on systems with emutls and similarly \"bad\" TLS support. As a result, backtracing is now more reliable (e.g., on QNX).\r\n\r\n* OSX operator new/delete performance has been improved. OSX's malloc performance is badly compromised by its support of malloc zones, so we cannot help much (the same applies to much of our competition among memory allocators). But the C++ new/delete API doesn't have to integrate with this stuff, so we now directly replace those functions for a sizeable speedup. Note that OSX performance is still not on par with other \"prime tier\" OSes due to its lack of efficient TLS support.\r\n\r\n* Long deprecated google/ headers have been deleted (use, e.g., \"gperftools/tcmalloc.h\" instead)\r\n\r\n* All clang builds now use -Wthread-safety and actually check thread-safety declarations\r\n\r\n* Our code has stopped being incompatible with _TIME_BITS=64 on modern GNU Linux systems (relevant only for 32-bit systems)\r\n\r\n* OpenSolaris build has been verified and fixed when needed\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for code contributions:\r\n\r\n* Github user oPiZiL (build fix for gcc 7.5)\r\n\r\n* Github user zhangdexin (qnx fixes)\r\n\r\n* Ishant Goyal (support for configuring minimal per-thread cache size)\r\n\r\n* Lennox Ho (several build fixes and several fixes around Windows support)\r\n\r\n* Olivier Langlois\r\n\r\n* Sergey Fedorovhas (another fix for building gperftools on old PPC\r\n  OSX computers)\r\n\r\n* Xiang.Lin (several OSX

2.14 is out!\r\n\r\nThis release has the following set of notable changes:\r\n\r\n* Roman Geissler has contributed a fix to nasty initialization bug introduced in 2.13 (see github issue #1452 for one example where it fails).\r\n\r\n* spinlock delay support now has proper windows support. Instead of simply sleeping, it uses WaitOnAddress (which is basically windows equivalent of futexes). This improvement was contributed by Lennox Ho.\r\n\r\n* we now have basic QNX support (basic malloc + heap profiler) championed by Xiang.Lin. Thanks! Do note, however, that QNX doesn't provide SIGPROF ticks, so there will be no cpu profiler support on this OS.\r\n\r\n* Yikai Zhao has contributed several fixes to important corner cases of generic_fp stacktrace method.\r\n\r\n* several people have contributed various improvements to our cmake build: Lennox Ho, Sergey Fedorov, Mateusz Jakub Fila. But do note that cmake build is still incomplete and best-effort.\r\n\r\n* Julian Schroeder have fixed generic_fp incompatibility with ARM pointer auth.\r\n\r\n* Mateusz Jakub Fila has contributed implementation of mallocinfo2 function (64-bit version of mallinfo).\r\n\r\n* Lennox Ho has updated C malloc extension shims to include {Set,Get}MemoryReleaseRate.\r\n\r\n* Lennox Ho has contributed the ability to disable malloc functions patching on windows when TCMALLOC_DISABLE_REPLACEMENT=1 environment variable is set.\r\n\r\n* User poljak181 has contributed a fix to infinite recursion in some cases of malloc hooks (or user-replaced operator new) and MallocExtension::instance().\r\n\r\n* Sergey Fedorov has contributed a fix to use MAP_ANON on some older OSes without MAP_ANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\n* the way we detect working ucontext->pc extraction method was reworked and is now fully compile-time as opposed to config-time. This means no more duplication and mismatches between autoconf and cmake bits in this area.\r\n\r\nList of relevant tickets can be seen online at:

That is, all unit tests pass on those architectures (previously the heap leak checker was broken).\r\n\r\nAlso notable is that heap leak checker support is officially deprecated as of this release. All bug fixes from now are on a best effort basis. For clarity we also declare that it is only expected to work (for some definition of work) on Linux/x86 (all kinds), Linux/aarch64, Linux/arm, Linux/ppc (untested as of this writing) and Linux/mips (untested as well). While some functionality worked in the past on BSDs, it was never fully functional; and will never be. We strongly recommend everyone to switch to asan and friends.\r\n\r\nFor major internal changes it is also worth mentioning that we now fully switched to C++-11 std::atomic. All custom OS- and arch-specific atomic bits have been removed at last.\r\n\r\nAnother notable change is that mmap and sbrk hooks facility is now no-op. We keep API and ABI for formal compatibility, but the calls to add mmap/sbrk hooks do nothing and return an error (whenever possible as part of API). There seem to be no users of it anyways, and mmap replacement API that is part of that facility really screwed up 64-bit offsets on (some/most) 32-bit systems. Internally for heap profiler and heap checker we have a new, but non-public API (see mmap_hook.h).\r\n\r\nMost tests now pass on NetBSD x86-64 (I tested on version 9.2). And only one that fails is new stacktrace test for stacktraces from signal handler (so there could be some imperfections for cpu profiles).\r\n\r\nWe don't warn people away from the libgcc stacktrace capturing method anymore. In fact users on most recent glibc-s are advised to use it (pass --enable-libgcc-unwinder-by-default). This is thanks to the dl_find_object API offered by glibc which allows this implementation to be fully async-signal-safe. Modern Linux distros should from now on build their gperftools package with this enabled (other than those built on top of musl).\r\n\r\ngeneric_fp and generic_fp_unsafe stacktrace capturing methods have been expanded for more architectures and even some basic non-Linux support. We have completely removed old x86-specific frame pointer stacktrace implementation in favor of those 2. _unsafe one should be roughly equivalent to the old x86 method. And 'safe' one is recommended as a new default for those who want FP-based stacktracing. Safe implementation robustly checks memory before accessing it, preventing unlikely, but not impossible crashes when frame pointers are bogus.\r\n\r\nOn platforms that support it, we now build gperftools with \"-fno-omit-frame-pointer -momit-leaf-frame-pointer\". This makes gperftools mostly frame-pointer-ful, but without performance hit in places that matter (this is how Google builds their binaries BTW). That should cover gcc (at least) on x86, aarch64 and riscv. Intention for this change is to make distro-shipped libtcmalloc.so compatible with frame-pointer stacktrace capturing (for those who still do heap profiling, for example). Of course, passing --enable-frame-pointers still gives you full frame pointers (i.e. even for leaf functions).\r\n\r\nThere is now support for detecting actual page size at runtime. tcmalloc will now allocate memory in units of this page size. It particularly helps on arms with 64k pages to return memory back to the kernel. But it is somewhat controversial, because it effectively bumps tcmalloc logical page size on those machines potentially increasing fragmentation. In any case, there is now a new environment variable TCMALLOC_OVERRIDE_PAGESIZE allowing people to override this check. I.e. to either reduce effective page size down to tcmalloc's logical page size or to increase it.\r\n\r\nMallocExtension::MarkThreadTemporarilyIdle has been changed to be identical to MarkThreadIdle. MarkThreadTemporarilyIdle is believed to be unused, anyways. See issue #880 for details.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole bunch of smaller fixes. Many of those smaller fixes had no associated ticket, but some had. People are advised to see here for list of notable tickets closed in this release: https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/issues?q=label%3Afixed-in-2.11+\r\n\r\nSome of those tickets are quite notable (fixes for rare deadlocks in cpu profiler ProfilerStop or while capturing heap growth stacktraces (aka growthz)).\r\n\r\nHere is list of notable contributions:\r\n\r\n* Chris Cambly has contributed initial support for AIX\r\n\r\n* Ali Saidi has contributed SpinlockPause implementation for aarch64\r\n\r\n* Henrik Reinstädtler has contributed fix for cpuprofiler on aarch64 OSX\r\n\r\n* Gabriel Marin has backported Chromium's commit for always sanity checking large frees\r\n\r\n* User zhangyiru has contributed a fix to report the number of leaked bytes as size_t instead of (usually 32-bit) int.\r\n\r\n* Sergey Fedorov has contributed some fix for building on older ppc-based OSX-es\r\n\r\n* User tigeran has removed unused using declaration\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to all contributors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/114578341/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/68200724","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/68200724/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/68200724/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/releases/tag/gperftools-2.10","id":68200724,"author":{"login":"alk","id":14850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk","html_url":"https://github.com/alk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAPjdps4EEKkU","tag_name":"gperftools-2.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"gperftools-2.10","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-05-31T04:28:55Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:40Z","published_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:40Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/assets/67091096","id":67091096,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAPjdps4D_7qY","name":"gperftools-2.10.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"alk","id":14850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk","html_url":"https://github.com/alk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1616679,"digest":null,"download_count":372394,"created_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:34Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:35Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/releases/download/gperftools-2.10/gperftools-2.10.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/releases/assets/67091091","id":67091091,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAPjdps4D_7qT","name":"gperftools-2.10.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"alk","id":14850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk","html_url":"https://github.com/alk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":1957368,"digest":null,"download_count":6926,"created_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/releases/download/gperftools-2.10/gperftools-2.10.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/tarball/gperftools-2.10","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gperftools/gperftools/zipball/gperftools-2.10","body":"30

Bundled MSVC project was converted to Visual Studio 2015.\r\n* User obones contributed fix for windows x64 TLS callbacks. This fixed leak of thread caches on thread exists in 64-bit windows.\r\n* releasing memory back to kernel is now made with page heap lock dropped.\r\n* HoluWu contributed fix for correct malloc patching on debug builds on windows. This configuration previously crashed.\r\n* Romain Geissler contributed fix for tls access during early tls initialization on dlopen.\r\n* large allocation reports are now silenced by default. Since not all programs want their stderr polluted by those messages. Contributed by Junhao Li.\r\n* HolyWu contributed improvements to MSVC project files. Notably, there is now project for \"overriding\" version of tcmalloc.\r\n* MS-specific _recalloc is now correctly zeroing only malloced part. This fix was contributed by HolyWu.\r\n* Brian Silverman contributed correctness fix to sampler_test.\r\n* Gabriel Marin ported few fixes from chromium's fork. As part of those fixes, we reduced number of static initializers (forbidden in chromium). Also we now syscalls via syscall function instead of reimplementing direct way to make syscalls on each platform.\r\n* Brian Silverman fixed flakiness in page heap test.\r\n* There is now configure flag to skip installing perl pprof, since external golang pprof is much superior. --disable-deprecated-pprof is the flag.\r\n* Fabric Fontaine contributed fixes to drop use of nonstandard __off64_t type.\r\n* Fabrice Fontaine contributed build fix to check for presence of nonstandard __sbrk functions. It is only used by mmap hooks code and (rightfully) not available on musl.\r\n* Fabrice Fontaine contributed build fix around mmap64 macro and function conflict in same cases.\r\n* there is now configure time option to enable aggressive decommit by default. Contributed by Laurent Stacul. --enable-aggressive-decommit-by-default is the flag.\r\n* Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho contributed build fixes for ppc around ucontext access.\r\n* User pkubaj contributed couple build fixes for FreeBSD/ppc.\r\n* configure now always assumes we have mmap. This fixes configure failures on some linux guests inside virtualbox. This fixed issue #1008.\r\n* User shipujin contributed syscall support fixes for mips64 (big and little endian).\r\n* Henrik Edin contributed configurable support for wide range of malloc page sizes. 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K and 256K are now supported via existing --with-tcmalloc-pagesize flag to configure.\r\n* Jon Kohler added overheads fields to per-size-class textual stats. Stats that are available via MallocExtension::instance()->GetStats().\r\n* tcmalloc can now avoid fallback from memfs to default sys allocator. TCMALLOC_MEMFS_DISABLE_FALLBACK switches this on. This was contributed by Jon Kohler.\r\n* Ilya Leoshkevich fixed mmap syscall support on s390.\r\n* Todd Lipcon contributed small build warning fix.\r\n* User prehistoricpenguin contributed misc source

I've extended his implementation to have roughly same performance as malloc/new.

This race could cause occasional violation of total thread cache size constraint. See issue #929 for more details.\r\n\r\n* Correct behavior in out-of-memory condition in fast-path cases was restored. This was another bug introduced by fast-path optimization in gperftools 2.6 which caused operator new to silently return NULL instead of doing correct C++ OOM handling (calling new_handler and throwing bad_alloc).\r\n\r\n* Khem Raj has contributed couple build fixes for newer glibcs (ucontext_t vs struct ucontext and loff_t definition)\r\n\r\n* Piotr Sikora has contributed build fix for OSX (not building unwind benchmark).

Another significant performance-affecting changes are\r\nreverting central free list transfer batch size back to 32 and\r\ndisabling of aggressive decommit mode by default.\r\n\r\nNote, while we still ship perl implementation of pprof, everyone is\r\nstrongly advised to use golang reimplementation of pprof from\r\nhttps://github.com/google/pprof.\r\n\r\nHere are notable changes in more details (and see ChangeLog for full\r\ndetails):\r\n\r\n* a bunch of performance tweaks to tcmalloc fast-path were\r\n  merged. This speeds up critical path of tcmalloc by few tens of\r\n  %. Well tuned and allocation-heavy programs should see substantial\r\n  performance boost (should apply to all modern elf platforms). This\r\n  is based on Google-internal tcmalloc changes for fast-path (with\r\n  obvious exception of lacking per-cpu mode, of course). Original\r\n  changes were made by Aliaksei Kandratsenka. And Andrew Hunter,\r\n  Dmitry Vyukov and Sanjay Ghemawat contributed with reviews and\r\n  discussions.\r\n\r\n* Architectures with 48 bits address space (x86-64 and aarch64) now\r\n  use faster 2 level page map. This was ported from Google-internal\r\n  change by Sanjay Ghemawat.\r\n\r\n* Default value of TCMALLOC_TRANSFER_NUM_OBJ was returned back to\r\n  32. Larger values have been found to hurt certain programs (but help\r\n  some other benchmarks). Value can still be tweaked at run time via\r\n  environment variable.\r\n\r\n* tcmalloc aggressive decommit mode is now disabled by default\r\n  again. It was found to degrade performance of certain tensorflow\r\n  benchmarks. Users who prefer smaller heap over small performance win\r\n  can still set environment variable TCMALLOC_AGGRESSIVE_DECOMMIT=t.\r\n\r\n* runtime switchable sized delete support has be fixed and re-enabled\r\n  (on GNU/Linux). Programs that use C++ 14 or later that use sized\r\n  delete can again be sped up by setting environment variable\r\n  TCMALLOC_ENABLE_SIZED_DELETE=t. Support for enabling sized\r\n  deallication support at compile-time is still present, of course.\r\n\r\n* tcmalloc now explicitly avoids use of MADV_FREE on Linux, unless\r\n  TCMALLOC_USE_MADV_FREE is defined at compile time. This is because\r\n  performance impact of MADV_FREE is not well known. Original issue\r\n  #780 raised by Mathias Stearn.\r\n\r\n* issue #786 with occasional deadlocks in stack trace capturing via\r\n  libunwind was fixed. It was originally reported as Ceph issue:\r\n  http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/13522\r\n\r\n* ChangeLog is now automatically generated from git log. Old ChangeLog\r\n  is now ChangeLog.old.\r\n\r\n* tcmalloc now provides implementation of nallocx. Function was\r\n  originally introduced by jemalloc and can be used to return real\r\n  allocation size given allocation request size. This is ported from\r\n  Google-internal tcmalloc change contributed by Dmitry Vyukov.\r\n\r\n* issue #843 which made tcmalloc crash when used with erlang runtime\r\n  was fixed.\r\n\r\n* issue #839 which caused tcmalloc's aggressive decommit mode to\r\n  degrade performance in some corner cases was fixed.\r\n\r\n* Bryan Chan contributed support for 31-bit s390.\r\n\r\n* Brian Silverman contributed compilation fix for 32-bit ARMs\r\n\r\n* Issue #817 that was causing tcmalloc to fail on windows 10 and\r\n  later, as well as on recent msvc was fixed.
