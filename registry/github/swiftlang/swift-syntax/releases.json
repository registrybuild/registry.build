The query is stateless and can be directly run on swift-syntax syntax tree, with any syntax node functioning as an entry point. It produces an enum-based data structure as a result that partitions collected names based on the lexical scope of introduction. \r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2952\r\n  - Notes: The library follows the behavior of the compiler implementation with some minor differences, such as a different way of handling dollar identifiers `$x` and generic parameters inside extensions. Furthermore, in the future, once the compiler adopts `SwiftLexicalLookup` and it becomes the canonical implementation, results produced by the query will be guaranteed to be correct.\r\n\r\n- `DiagnosticMessage` has a new optional property, `category`, that provides a category name and documentation URL for a diagnostic.\r\n  - Description: Tools often have many different diagnostics. Diagnostic categories allow tools to group several diagnostics together with documentation that can help users understand what the diagnostics mean and how to address them. This API allows diagnostics to provide this category information. The diagnostic renderer will provide the category at the end of the diagnostic message in the form `[#CategoryName]`, and can print categories as \"footnotes\" with its `categoryFootnotes` method.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2981\r\n  - Migration steps: None required. The new `category` property has optional type, and there is a default implementation that returns `nil`. Types that conform to `DiagnosticMessage` can choose to implement this property and provide a category when appropriate.\r\n\r\n- `DiagnosticsFormatter` has a new method, `formattedMessage`, that formats a diagnostic message without any corresponding syntax node.\r\n  - Description: Some tools want to use the diagnostics formatter to produce diagnostics that don't relate to source code, or for which the source code isn't available. This API allows them to do so while maintaining consistent presentation.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/3059\r\n  - Migration steps: None required.\r\n\r\n- `FixIt.Change` has a new case `replaceText` that performs a textual replacement of a range of text with another string.\r\n  - Description: The other `FixIt.Change` cases provide structured\r\n    modifications to syntax trees, such as replacing specific notes. Some\r\n    clients provide Fix-Its that don't fit well into this structured model. The\r\n    `replaceText` case makes it possible for such clients to express Fix-Its.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/3030\r\n  - Migration stems: None required.\r\n\r\n## API Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToTrailingClosures` has changed to `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToLiteralClosures`\r\n  - Description: Whether function-typed placeholders are expanded to trailing closures is now configurable using a `format` argument to this rewriter. Additionally clients that support nested placeholders may request that the entire expanded closure be wrapped in an outer placeholder, e.g. `<#{ <#foo#> in <#Bar#> }#>`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2897\r\n  - Migration steps: Replace uses of `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToTrailingClosures` with `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToLiteralClosures`. The initializer does not need to change: `.init(indentationWidth:)` on the new type provides the same behavior as the old type.\r\n  - Notes: This improves code completion in a SourceKitLSP session where the trailing closure form may be undesirable. The nested placeholders offer more flexibility to end users, in editors that support it.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxArena` and `ParsingSyntaxArena` has changed to SPI\r\n  - Description: `SyntaxArena` and the subclasses were only meant to be used when dealing with `RawSyntax` which is also SPI.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2930\r\n  - Migration steps: Do not use `SyntaxArena` or `ParsingSyntaxArena` directly.\r\n  - Notes: Although the type itself was `public`, most initializers were already SPI and there was no way to retrive them from existing types via public API.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxChildrenIndex` is no longer `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`\r\n  - Description: `nil` used to represent the end index. However, due to a change in the internal structure, the end index must now be retrieved from the collection.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2925\r\n  - Migration steps: Use `SyntaxChildren.endIndex` instead.\r\n  - Notes: `ExpressibleByNilLiteral` was a mistake. In general, `Collection.Index` should only be created and managed by the collection itself. For example, `Collection.index(after:)` exists, but `Index.advanced(by:)` does not.\r\n\r\n- Some cases in `AttributeSyntax.Arguments` choices and related types has been removed\r\n  - Description: Some attributes that used to have special attribute list syntax are now parsed as a regular `AttributeSyntax` with `.argumentList(LabeledExprListSyntax)`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/3028\r\n  - Migration steps: Use `AttributeSyntax.Arguments.argumentList(LabeledExprListSyntax)` instead.\r\n  - Notes: Removed cases from `AttributeSyntax.Arguments`: `token(TokenSyntax)`, `string(StringLiteralExprSyntax)`, `conventionArguments(ConventionAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`, `conventionWitnessMethodArguments(ConventionWitnessMethodAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`, `opaqueReturnTypeOfAttributeArguments(OpaqueReturnTypeOfAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`, `exposeAttributeArguments(ExposeAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`, `underscorePrivateAttributeArguments(UnderscorePrivateAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`, and `unavailableFromAsyncArguments(UnavailableFromAsyncAttributeArgumentsSyntax)`. Removed Syntax kinds: `ConventionAttributeArgumentsSyntax`, `ConventionWitnessMethodAttributeArgumentsSyntax`, `OpaqueReturnTypeOfAttributeArgumentsSyntax`, `ExposeAttributeArgumentsSyntax`, `UnderscorePrivateAttributeArgumentsSyntax`, and `UnavailableFromAsyncAttributeArgumentsSyntax`.\r\n\r\n- `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToLiteralClosures` & `CallToTrailingClosures` now take a `Syntax` parameter\r\n  - Description: These refactorings now take an arbitrary `Syntax` and return a `Syntax?`. If a non-function-like syntax node is passed, `nil` is returned. The previous `FunctionCallExprSyntax` overloads are deprecated.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/3092\r\n  - Migration steps: Insert a `Syntax(...)` initializer call for the argument, and cast the result with `.as(...)` if necessary.\r\n  - Notes: This allows the refactorings to correctly handle macro expansion expressions and

The `specifier` property captures the token representing which one was parsed.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2785\r\n\r\n- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax` and `FloatLiteralExprSyntax` now have a computed `representedLiteralValue` property.\r\n  - Description: Allows retrieving the represented literal value when valid.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605\r\n    \r\n- `SyntaxProtocol` now has a method `ancestorOrSelf`.\r\n  - Description: Returns the node or the first ancestor that satisfies `condition`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2696\r\n\r\n- `Error` protocol now has an `asDiagnostics(at:)` method.\r\n  - Description: This method translates an error into one or more diagnostics, recognizing `DiagnosticsError` and `DiagnosticMessage` instances or providing its own `Diagnostic` as needed.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1816\r\n\r\n- Added a new library `SwiftIfConfig`.\r\n  - Description: This new library provides facilities for evaluating `#if` conditions and determining which regions of a syntax tree are active according to a given build configuration.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1816\r\n  \r\n- `SwiftBasicFormat` adds a method `indented(by:)` to all syntax node types.\r\n  - Description: This method indents a node’s contents using a provided piece of `Trivia`, optionally including the first line.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2843\r\n\r\n- `Parser.ExperimentalFeatures` has a new `init?(name: String)` initializer.\r\n  - Description: This initializer returns the `Parser.ExperimentalFeatures` value that matches the experimental parser feature with the given name. The name must be spelled the same way as it is when passed to the compiler using the `-enable-experimental-feature` flag.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2895\r\n\r\n## API Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.trimmed` detaches the node\r\n  - Description: Getting a trimmed version of a node detaches it from its parent. Having the trimmed node be attached to a parent was not intuitive because eg. printing the parent node would have the trimmed trivia missing, most likely forming invalid Swift code.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2689\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- `GenericParameterSyntax` deprecated `eachKeyword` in favor of `specifier`\r\n  - Description: `specifier` is now used to grab either the `each` keyword for a generic parameter or the `let` keyword.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2785\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalEdit` deprecated in favor of `SourceEdit`\r\n  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` is being dropped for `SourceEdit`. `SourceEdit` has deprecated compatibility layers to make it API-compatible with `IncrementalEdit`\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2532\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2604\r\n  \r\n- `ClosureCaptureSyntax.init(leadingTrivia:specifier:name:equal:expression:trailingComma:trailingTrivia:)` deprecated in favor of a new `ClosureCaptureSyntax.init(leadingTrivia:_:specifier:_:name:_:initializer:_:trailingComma:_:trailingTrivia:)` initializer.\r\n  - Description: `ClosureCaptureSyntax` now has an `initializer` property instead of `equal` and `expression`. Additionally, the `name` property is no longer optional.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2763 \r\n\r\n- `Indenter` in `SwiftSyntaxBuilder` has been deprecated in favor of the new `indented(by:)` in `SwiftBasicFormat`.\r\n  - Description: Indenting is really more of a formatting operation than a syntax-building operation. Additionally, the `indented(by:)` method is more intuitive to use than a `SyntaxRewriter`. Aside from `BasicFormat`, there are no other public `SyntaxRewriter` classes in the package.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2843\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.rightType` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.RightType`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.leftType` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.LeftType`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `GenericArgumentSyntax.argument` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `GenericArgumentSyntax.Argument`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- Moved `Radix` and `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.radix` from `SwiftRefactor` to `SwiftSyntax`.\r\n  - Description: Allows retrieving the radix value from the `literal.text`.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605\r\n\r\n- `FixIt.Change` gained a new case `replaceChild(data:)`.\r\n  - Description: The new case covers the replacement of a child node with another node.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2205\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2758\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `FixIt.Change`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `ClosureCaptureSyntax.name` is no longer optional.\r\n  - Description: Due to the new `ClosureCaptureSyntax` node structure, `name` property is non-optional.\r\n  -

Description: the `edits` represent the non-overlapping textual `edits` that need to be performed when the Fix-It is applied.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp/issues/909\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2314\r\n\r\n- `SourceEdit`\r\n  - Description: `SourceEdit` has been moved from SwiftRefactor to SwiftSyntax\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp/issues/909\r\n  -

Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2015\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2021\r\n\r\n- `DeclSyntaxEnum`, `StmtSyntaxEnum`, `ExprSyntaxEnum`, `TypeSyntaxEnum`, and `PatternSyntaxEnum`\r\n  - Description: Enum to exhaustively switch over all different syntax nodes of each base type.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2351\r\n\r\n- `WithOptionalCodeBlock`\r\n  - Description: A trait for syntax nodes that have an optional code block, such as `FunctionDeclSyntax` and `InitializerDeclSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2359\r\n\r\n- `CodeBlockSyntax`\r\n  - Description: `CodeBlockSyntax` is now `SyntaxParseable`, so it can be used with string interpolations.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2361\r\n\r\n- `ThrowsClause`\r\n  - Description: The `throwsSpecifier` for the effects nodes (`AccessorEffectSpecifiers`, `FunctionEffectSpecifiers`, `TypeEffectSpecifiers`, `EffectSpecifiers`) has been replaced with `throwsClause`, which captures both the throws specifier and the (optional) thrown error type, as introduced by SE-0413.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2379\r\n\r\n- `String.isValidSwiftIdentifier(for:)`\r\n  - Description: `SwiftParser` adds an extension on `String` to check if it can be used as an identifier in a given context.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2434\r\n\r\n- `MacroDeclSyntax.expand`\r\n  - the `expand(argumentList:definition:replacements:)` method gains a new parameter 'genericReplacements:' that is defaulted to an empty array.\r\n  - The method's signature is now `expand(argumentList:definition:replacements:genericReplacements:)`\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2450\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.asMacroLexicalContext()` and `allMacroLexicalContexts(enclosingSyntax:)`\r\n  - Description: Produce the lexical context for a given syntax node (if it has one), or the entire stack of lexical contexts enclosing a syntax node, for use in macro expansion.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1554\r\n\r\n- `TriviaPiece.isComment`\r\n  -

Description: `macroSpecs` can have additional specifications like conformances provided by member or extension macro that can be used for macro expansion.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2031\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2327\r\n\r\n- `BasicFormat.inferIndentation(of:)`\r\n  - Description: Uses heuristics to infer the indentation width used in a syntax tree.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2514\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalEdit` stores replacement text\r\n  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` used to store the range that was replaced and the length of the replacement but not the replacement bytes by itself. `IncrementalEdit` now has a `replacement` property that contains the replacement bytes.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2527\r\n\r\n- Type specifiers\r\n  - Description: `AttributedTypeSyntax` can now contain multiple specifiers and these types are used to model the list of specifiers. Additionally, type specifiers can now contain arguments, like `borrow(data)`. To facilitate this, the following new types were introduces: `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentListSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentsSyntax`, `LifetimeTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `SimpleTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `TypeSpecifierListSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- `DeclGroupSyntax.introducer`\r\n  - Description: The `DeclGroupSyntax` trait has an extra `introducer` property, ie. the keyword that introduces the declaration.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp/issues/2535\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2539\r\n\r\n- `ExprSyntax.interpretedAsVersionTuple`\r\n  - Description: With the change to parse `#if canImport(MyModule, _version: 1.2.3)` as a function call instead of a dedicated syntax node, `1.2.3` natively gets parsed as a member access `3` to the `1.2` float literal. This property allows the reinterpretation of such an expression as a version tuple.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.node(at:)` \r\n  - Description: Given a `SyntaxIdentifier`, returns the `Syntax` node with that identifier\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree`\r\n  - Description: Uniquely identifies a syntax node within a tree. This is similar to ``SyntaxIdentifier`` but does not store the root ID of the tree. It can thus be transferred across trees that are structurally equivalent, for example two copies of the same tree that live in different processes. The only public functions on this type are `toOpaque` and `init(fromOpaque:)`, which allow serialization of the `IndexInTree`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n  \r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier` conformance to `Comparable`:\r\n  - Description: A `SyntaxIdentifier` compares less than another `SyntaxIdentifier` if the node at that identifier occurs first during a depth-first traversal of the tree.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` and `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` \r\n  - Description: `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` allows the retrieval of a `SyntaxIdentifier` that identifies the syntax node independent of the syntax tree. `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` allows the creation for a `SyntaxIdentifier` from a tree-agnostic `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree` and the tree's root node.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SwiftSyntaxMacrosGenericTestSupport`\r\n  - Description: A version of the `SwiftSyntaxMacrosTestSupport` module that doesn't depend on `Foundation` or `XCTest` and can thus be used to write macro tests using `swift-testing`. Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\r\n\r\n- `TokenSyntax.identifier`\r\n  - Description: Adds an `identifier` property to `TokenSyntax` which returns a canonicalized representation of an identifier that strips away backticks.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2576\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- Child Choice Node Casts\r\n  - Description: `is`, `as`, and `cast` methods for types not contained in the choice node are marked as deprecated. The deprecated methods will emit a warning, indicating that the cast will always fail.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2092\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2184\r\n  - Migration steps: Remove the `is`, `as` or `cast` methods because they will always fail.\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalParseTransition`:\r\n  - Description: The initializer `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousTree:edits:lookaheadRanges:reusedNodeCallback:)` is marked as deprecated. Use `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: Call `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` moved to the `SwiftSyntaxMacros` module\r\n  - Description: Move the `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` types from the `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` module to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`. Deprecated typealiases in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` forward to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2338\r\n  - Notes: The expansion diagnostic messages were defined in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion`, which is intended as an implementation detail of the plugin server and should not need to be imported by macros.\r\n\r\n- `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax`:\r\n  - Description: `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax` are now deprecated and placeholders are instead parsed as identifiers within a `MissingDeclSyntax` or `DeclReferenceExprSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2237\r\n\r\n- `AttributedTypeSyntax.specifier` has renamed to `specifiers` and changed to be a collection\r\n  - Description: Types can have multiple specifiers now and the syntax tree has been modified to reflect that.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- ` CanImportExprSyntax` and `CanImportVersionInfoSyntax`\r\n  - Description: Instead of parsing `canImport` inside `#if` directives as a special expression node, parse it as a functionc call expression. This is in-line with how the `swift(>=6.0)` and `compiler(>=6.0)` directives are parsed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `MacroDefinition` used for expanding macros:\r\n  - Description: The `MacroDefinition/expansion` enum case used to have two values (`(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement])`), has now gained another value in order to support generic argument replacements in macro expansions: `(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement], genericReplacements: [GenericArgumentReplacement])`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2450\r\n  - Migration steps: Code which exhaustively checked over the enum should be changed to `case .expansion(let node, let replacements, let genericReplacements):`. Creating the `.extension` gained a compatibility shim, retaining the previous syntax source compatible (`return .expansion(node, replacements: [])`).\r\n\r\n- Effect specifiers:\r\n  - Description: The `unexpectedAfterThrowsSpecifier` node of the various effect specifiers has been removed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2219\r\n  - Migration steps: Check `unexpectedBetweenThrowsSpecifierAndThrownError` and `unexpectedAfterThrownError` instead.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxKind` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `SyntaxKind` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all syntax kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: Exhaustively check all the syntax nodes that your program supports. There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `SyntaxKind`.\r\n\r\n- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all radix kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix`.\r\n\r\n- `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:parseTransition:)` and `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:maximumNestingLevel:parseTransition:)`:\r\n  - Description: The default versions of `Parser.parseIncrementally` return a `IncrementalParseResult` instead of a tuple. Access to the struct should be compatible with the tuple in almost all cases unless the tuple is stored into a variable and then destructed or passed to a function that expects a tuple.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: If necessary, change type annotations from the tuple to the `IncrementalParseResult` type.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxClassification` gained a new case: `argumentLabel`\r\n  - The new classification case covers the first names of parameters in function-like declarations and the label of arguments in function-like calls.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2375\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxClassification`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind` gained new cases: `throwsClause`\r\n  - The new cases cover the newly introduced `ThrowsClauseSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2379\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansionContext` now requires a property `lexicalContext`:\r\n  - Description: The new property provides the lexical context in which the macro is expanded, and has several paired API changes. Types that conform to `MacroExpansionContext` will need to implement this property. Additionally, the `HostToPluginMessage` cases `expandFreestandingMacro` and `expandAttachedMacro` now include an optional `lexicalContext`. Finally, the `SyntaxProtocol.expand(macros:in:indentationWidth:)` syntactic expansion operation has been deprecated in favor of a new version `expand(macros:contextGenerator:indentationWidth:)` that takes a function produces a new macro expansion context for each expansion.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1554\r\n  - Migration steps: Add the new property `lexicalContext` to any `MacroExpansionContext`-conforming types. If implementing the host-to-plugin message protocol, add support for `lexicalContext`. For macro expansion operations going through `SyntaxProtocol.expand`, provide a context generator that creates a fresh context including the lexical context.\r\n\r\n- `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` in `SwiftParserDiagnostics` removed\r\n  - Description: `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` was not intended to be public API.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2531\r\n  - Migration steps: Use `if case .backslash = triviaPiece` instead\r\n\r\n- All symbols in `SwiftCompilerPluginMessageHandling` are now SPI\r\n  - Description: This module is only intended to be used from some internal components.

Description: The `throwsSpecifier` for the effects nodes (`AccessorEffectSpecifiers`, `FunctionEffectSpecifiers`, `TypeEffectSpecifiers`, `EffectSpecifiers`) has been replaced with `throwsClause`, which captures both the throws specifier and the (optional) thrown error type, as introduced by SE-0413.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2379\r\n\r\n- `String.isValidSwiftIdentifier(for:)`\r\n  - Description: `SwiftParser` adds an extension on `String` to check if it can be used as an identifier in a given context.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2434\r\n\r\n- `MacroDeclSyntax.expand`\r\n  - the `expand(argumentList:definition:replacements:)` method gains a new parameter 'genericReplacements:' that is defaulted to an empty array.\r\n  -

Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2327\r\n\r\n- `BasicFormat.inferIndentation(of:)`\r\n  - Description: Uses heuristics to infer the indentation width used in a syntax tree.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2514\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalEdit` stores replacement text\r\n  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` used to store the range that was replaced and the length of the replacement but not the replacement bytes by itself. `IncrementalEdit` now has a `replacement` property that contains the replacement bytes.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2527\r\n\r\n- Type specifiers\r\n  - Description: `AttributedTypeSyntax` can now contain multiple specifiers and these types are used to model the list of specifiers. Additionally, type specifiers can now contain arguments, like `borrow(data)`. To facilitate this, the following new types were introduces: `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentListSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentsSyntax`, `LifetimeTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `SimpleTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `TypeSpecifierListSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- `DeclGroupSyntax.introducer`\r\n  - Description: The `DeclGroupSyntax` trait has an extra `introducer` property, ie. the keyword that introduces the declaration.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp/issues/2535\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2539\r\n\r\n- `ExprSyntax.interpretedAsVersionTuple`\r\n  - Description: With the change to parse `#if canImport(MyModule, _version: 1.2.3)` as a function call instead of a dedicated syntax node, `1.2.3` natively gets parsed as a member access `3` to the `1.2` float literal. This property allows the reinterpretation of such an expression as a version tuple.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.node(at:)` \r\n  - Description: Given a `SyntaxIdentifier`, returns the `Syntax` node with that identifier\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree`\r\n  - Description: Uniquely identifies a syntax node within a tree. This is similar to ``SyntaxIdentifier`` but does not store the root ID of the tree. It can thus be transferred across trees that are structurally equivalent, for example two copies of the same tree that live in different processes. The only public functions on this type are `toOpaque` and `init(fromOpaque:)`, which allow serialization of the `IndexInTree`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n  \r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier` conformance to `Comparable`:\r\n  - Description: A `SyntaxIdentifier` compares less than another `SyntaxIdentifier` if the node at that identifier occurs first during a depth-first traversal of the tree.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` and `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` \r\n  - Description: `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` allows the retrieval of a `SyntaxIdentifier` that identifies the syntax node independent of the syntax tree. `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` allows the creation for a `SyntaxIdentifier` from a tree-agnostic `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree` and the tree's root node.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SwiftSyntaxMacrosGenericTestSupport`\r\n  - Description: A version of the `SwiftSyntaxMacrosTestSupport` module that doesn't depend on `Foundation` or `XCTest` and can thus be used to write macro tests using `swift-testing`. Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\r\n\r\n- `TokenSyntax.identifier`\r\n  - Description: Adds an `identifier` property to `TokenSyntax` which returns a canonicalized representation of an identifier that strips away backticks.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2576\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- Child Choice Node Casts\r\n  - Description: `is`, `as`, and `cast` methods for types not contained in the choice node are marked as deprecated. The deprecated methods will emit a warning, indicating that the cast will always fail.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2092\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2184\r\n  - Migration steps: Remove the `is`, `as` or `cast` methods because they will always fail.\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalParseTransition`:\r\n  - Description: The initializer `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousTree:edits:lookaheadRanges:reusedNodeCallback:)` is marked as deprecated. Use `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: Call `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` moved to the `SwiftSyntaxMacros` module\r\n  - Description: Move the `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` types from the `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` module to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`. Deprecated typealiases in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` forward to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2338\r\n  - Notes: The expansion diagnostic messages were defined in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion`, which is intended as an implementation detail of the plugin server and should not need to be imported by macros.\r\n\r\n- `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax`:\r\n  - Description: `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax` are now deprecated and placeholders are instead parsed as identifiers within a `MissingDeclSyntax` or `DeclReferenceExprSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2237\r\n\r\n- `AttributedTypeSyntax.specifier` has renamed to `specifiers` and changed to be a collection\r\n  - Description: Types can have multiple specifiers now and the syntax tree has been modified to reflect that.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- ` CanImportExprSyntax` and `CanImportVersionInfoSyntax`\r\n  - Description: Instead of parsing `canImport` inside `#if` directives as a special expression node, parse it as a functionc call expression. This is in-line with how the `swift(>=6.0)` and `compiler(>=6.0)` directives are parsed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `MacroDefinition` used for expanding macros:\r\n  - Description: The `MacroDefinition/expansion` enum case used to have two values (`(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement])`), has now gained another value in order to support generic argument replacements in macro expansions: `(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement], genericReplacements: [GenericArgumentReplacement])`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2450\r\n  - Migration steps: Code which exhaustively checked over the enum should be changed to `case .expansion(let node, let replacements, let genericReplacements):`. Creating the `.extension` gained a compatibility shim, retaining the previous syntax source compatible (`return .expansion(node, replacements: [])`).\r\n\r\n- Effect specifiers:\r\n  - Description: The `unexpectedAfterThrowsSpecifier` node of the various effect specifiers has been removed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2219\r\n  - Migration steps: Check `unexpectedBetweenThrowsSpecifierAndThrownError` and `unexpectedAfterThrownError` instead.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxKind` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `SyntaxKind` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all syntax kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: Exhaustively check all the syntax nodes that your program supports. There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `SyntaxKind`.\r\n\r\n- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all radix kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix`.\r\n\r\n- `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:parseTransition:)` and `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:maximumNestingLevel:parseTransition:)`:\r\n  - Description: The default versions of `Parser.parseIncrementally` return a `IncrementalParseResult` instead of a tuple. Access to the struct should be compatible with the tuple in almost all cases unless the tuple is stored into a variable and then destructed or passed to a function that expects a tuple.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: If necessary, change type annotations from the tuple to the `IncrementalParseResult` type.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxClassification` gained a new case: `argumentLabel`\r\n  - The new classification case covers the first names of parameters in function-like declarations and the label of arguments in function-like calls.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2375\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxClassification`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind` gained new cases: `throwsClause`\r\n  - The new cases cover the newly introduced `ThrowsClauseSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2379\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansionContext` now requires a property `lexicalContext`:\r\n  - Description: The new property provides the lexical context in which the macro is expanded, and has several paired API changes. Types that conform to `MacroExpansionContext` will need to implement this property. Additionally, the `HostToPluginMessage` cases `expandFreestandingMacro` and `expandAttachedMacro` now include an optional `lexicalContext`. Finally, the `SyntaxProtocol.expand(macros:in:indentationWidth:)` syntactic expansion operation has been deprecated in favor of a new version `expand(macros:contextGenerator:indentationWidth:)` that takes a function produces a new macro expansion context for each expansion.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1554\r\n  - Migration steps: Add the new property `lexicalContext` to any `MacroExpansionContext`-conforming types. If implementing the host-to-plugin message protocol, add support for `lexicalContext`. For macro expansion operations going through `SyntaxProtocol.expand`, provide a context generator that creates a fresh context including the lexical context.\r\n\r\n- `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` in `SwiftParserDiagnostics` removed\r\n  - Description: `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` was not intended to be public API.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2531\r\n  - Migration steps: Use `if case .backslash = triviaPiece` instead\r\n\r\n- All symbols in `SwiftCompilerPluginMessageHandling` are now SPI\r\n  - Description: This module is only intended to be used from some internal components. Any other modules should not use them directly.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2489\r\n  - Migration steps: Stop using this module.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/175019078/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":18,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/173746730","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/173746730/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/173746730/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/tag/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-09-04","id":173746730,"author":{"login":"ahoppen","id":4062178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjIxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4062178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoppen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOCIc4qs4KWyoq","tag_name":"600.0.0-prerelease-2024-09-04","target_commitish":"main","name":"600.0.0-prerelease-2024-09-04","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2024-08-12T21:52:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T23:39:45Z","published_at":"2024-09-05T23:39:45Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/tarball/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-09-04","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/zipball/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-09-04","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/173746730/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/170275473","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/170275473/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/170275473/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/tag/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-08-14","id":170275473,"author":{"login":"ahoppen","id":4062178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjIxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4062178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoppen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOCIc4qs4KJjKR","tag_name":"600.0.0-prerelease-2024-08-14","target_commitish":"main","name":"600.0.0-prerelease-2024-08-14","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2024-08-12T21:52:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T01:16:51Z","published_at":"2024-08-15T01:16:51Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/tarball/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-08-14","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/zipball/600.0.0-prerelease-2024-08-14","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/170275473/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/168353934","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/168353934/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/168353934/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/releases/tag/510.0.3","id":168353934,"author":{"login":"ahoppen","id":4062178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjIxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4062178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoppen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoppen

On macOS, this version of SwiftSyntax is compatible with any recent Swift or Xcode toolchain because it includes the parser library as a binary dependency.
