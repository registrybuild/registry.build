\"critical\"\r\n\r\nHigh Level Changes:\r\nThis release deprecated \"....TEST_CASE\" API in favor of \"....TEST_SUITE\". In a nutshell if you have code that uses something like \"INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P \" - this and all other \"*_TEST_CASE \" are now deprecated in favor of more standard _TEST_SUITE. See https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md#beware-of-the-nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThere is also new powerful MOCK_METHOD macro.

This replaces older way of mocking.\r\nFor example\r\n(Old) MOCK_METHOD1(Bar, double(std::string s));\r\n(New) MOCK_METHOD(double, Bar, (std::string s), (override));\r\nSo there is no need to count the parameters anymore.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/releases/20451459/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/releases/9083259","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/releases/9083259/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/google/googletest/releases/9083259/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.8.1","id":9083259,"author":{"login":"gennadiycivil","id":12735026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzM1MDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12735026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil","html_url":"https://github.com/gennadiycivil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gennadiycivil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTkwODMyNTk=","tag_name":"release-1.8.1","target_commitish":"v1.8.x","name":"v1.8.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-08-31T15:21:57Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T15:53:24Z","published_at":"2018-08-31T15:53:24Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/tarball/release-1.8.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/zipball/release-1.8.1","body":"1.8.1 Release reflects a current version of the project.\r\nThe 1.8.x is the last release supporting pre-C++11 compilers. \r\nThe 1.8.x will not accept any requests for any new features and any bugfix requests will only be accepted if proven \"critical\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/googletest/releases/9083259/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}}]
