 * `ReturnRoundRobin` (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/37f322783175a66c11785d17fc153477b0777753)\r\n* Added `Matcher<std::string_view>` specialization that internally stores a `string` instead of `string_view` (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/6f5fd0d7199b9a19faa9f499ecc266e6ae0329e7)\r\n* String matchers now accept `string_view` input (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/13a433a94dd9c7e55907d7a9b75f44ff82f309eb)\r\n* `DoubleNearPredFormat` matcher now fails on impractically small epsilons (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/b5687db554a295e697f5d459cf6d3f343d2ca179)\r\n* `Truly` matcher now explains failures (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/0c400f67fcf305869c5fb113dd296eca266c9725)\r\n* Matchers can now be implemented without extending `MatcherInterface` (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/c13c27a513ecd1cbf5700a45fe590e85e8ae6770)\r\n* Added output messages for skipped tests (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2517, https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2767)\r\n\r\n## Behavior\r\n* **New flags**\r\n    * `--gtest_brief` shows only test failures in output (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2751)\r\n    * `--gtest_fail_fast` stops test execution on first failure (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/1ced315a483f4ecac21893ce6ceeb502afb82eff)\r\n* Failures in `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` now cause tests to fail rather than log (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/9ed99c6c837ae1cbfcabd36959fc802ebb5ae07f)\r\n* Uninstantiated `TEST_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P` now fail unless allowlisted using `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/d442089d53cecbba59b2d8f35d06eac01f1e46da, https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/a13a0626188b4e7d22d63a4c9fcfe9f441c81e4a, https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/0b024bd91a14a77a7e7d6072ccd88e09c86ddeaa,

specialized printing for `std::any`, `std::optional`, and `std::variant` (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2742)\r\n* Added recursive printing for `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/6b2e74905e9a7e70c7d1017ee0dfe5a8e88a1300)\r\n* Printing incomplete types is now supported (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/f8304d762e0ed119d3d1c72deb1976dc80029db5)\r\n* Start timestamps in XML/JSON output now use millisecond precision (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/af1e75ce0b3429d70790c049d8dbb0aae3e2480f)\r\n* Added more structured information about test suite to XML/JSON output on environment failures (https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/ac1d60c2b5ae62a06eca1d2c0f9d6dc92cda8711)\r\n\r\n## Build & Test\r\n* CMake minimum increased to 2.8.12 (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/3094)\r\n* GoogleTest is now using Kokoro CI instead of Travis and AppVeyor\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n* Removed support for `GTEST_HAS_STD_STRING` (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2456)\r\n* Replaced pump code generation with variadic templates (https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2388,

In a nutshell if you have code that uses something like \"INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P \" - this and all other \"*_TEST_CASE \" are now deprecated in favor of more standard _TEST_SUITE.
