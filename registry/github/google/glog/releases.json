To customize the log line prefix use the `google::InstallPrefixFormatter` function instead of the `google::InitGoogleLogging` overload.\r\n\r\n## Further changes\r\n\r\n* `google::LogSeverity` has been converted to an unscoped `enum`. This can result in compilation issues if implicit conversion between an `int` and `google::LogSeverity` was erroneously assumed.\r\n* By default, CMake no longer generates the undocumented and untested pkg-config files. The support is now opt in which requires the CMake option `WITH_PKGCONFIG` to be explicitly set to `ON`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* bazel: Use glog 0.6.0 in README. by @xiaoxq in
