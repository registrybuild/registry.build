though this is a pre-release for v1.2.0, it is expected that some changes will be added before release; most notably concerning build files: patches applied by Alpine, Debian, Conan, VCPKG will be partially/fully integrated.\r\n\r\n### SECURITY\r\n - python: added `Decompressor::can_accept_more_data` method and optional\r\n           `output_buffer_limit` argument `Decompressor::process`;\r\n           that allows mitigation of unexpectedly large output;\r\n           reported by Charles Chan (https://github.com/charleswhchan)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n - **decoder / encoder: added static initialization to reduce binary size**\r\n - python: allow limiting decoder output (see SECURITY section)\r\n - CLI: `brcat` alias; allow decoding concatenated brotli streams\r\n - kt: pure Kotlin decoder\r\n - cgo: support \"raw\" dictionaries\r\n - build: Bazel modules\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n - java: dropped `finalize()` for native entities\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n - java: in `compress` pass correct length to native encoder\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n - build: install man pages\r\n - build: updated / fixed / refined Bazel buildfiles\r\n - encoder: faster encoding\r\n - cgo: link via pkg-config\r\n - python: modernize extension / allow multi-phase module initialization\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n - decoder / encoder: static tables use \"small\" model (allows 2GiB+ binaries)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/252418107/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/120781007","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/120781007/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/120781007/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/google/brotli/releases/tag/dev/null","id":120781007,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAX1dcs4HMvjP","tag_name":"dev/null","target_commitish":"master","name":"dev/null","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2023-09-12T10:46:40Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T10:08:51Z","published_at":"2023-09-12T11:47:46Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/assets/125679481","id":125679481,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAX1dcs4Hfbd5","name":"brotli-x64-windows-dynamic.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":373194,"digest":null,"download_count":724,"created_at":"2023-09-12T12:11:55Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T12:11:56Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/google/brotli/releases/download/dev/null/brotli-x64-windows-dynamic.zip"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/brotli/releases/assets/125679594","id":125679594,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAX1dcs4Hfbfq","name":"brotli-x64-windows-static.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":357086,"digest":null,"download_count":721,"created_at":"2023-09-12T12:12:59Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T12:12:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://githu
