SECURITY\r\n - python: added `Decompressor::can_accept_more_data` method and optional\r\n           `output_buffer_limit` argument `Decompressor::process`;\r\n           that allows mitigation of unexpectedly large output;\r\n           reported by Charles Chan (https://github.com/charleswhchan)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n - **decoder / encoder: added static initialization to reduce binary size**\r\n - python: allow limiting decoder output (see SECURITY section)\r\n - CLI: `brcat` alias; allow decoding concatenated brotli streams\r\n - kt: pure Kotlin decoder\r\n - cgo: support \"raw\" dictionaries\r\n - build: Bazel modules\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n - java: dropped `finalize()` for native entities\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n - java: in `compress` pass correct length to native encoder\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n - build: install man pages\r\n - build: updated / fixed / refined Bazel buildfiles\r\n - encoder: faster encoding\r\n - cgo: link via pkg-config\r\n - python: modernize extension / allow multi-phase module initialization\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n - decoder / encoder: static tables use \"small\" model (allows 2GiB+

though this is a pre-release for v1.2.0, it is expected that some changes will be added before release; most notably concerning build files: patches applied by Alpine, Debian, Conan, VCPKG will be partially/fully integrated.\r\n\r\n### SECURITY\r\n - python: added `Decompressor::can_accept_more_data` method and optional\r\n           `output_buffer_limit` argument `Decompressor::process`;\r\n           that allows mitigation of unexpectedly large output;\r\n           reported by Charles Chan (https://github.com/charleswhchan)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n - **decoder / encoder: added static initialization to reduce binary size**\r\n - python: allow limiting decoder output (see SECURITY section)\r\n - CLI: `brcat` alias; allow decoding concatenated brotli streams\r\n - kt: pure Kotlin decoder\r\n - cgo: support \"raw\" dictionaries\r\n - build: Bazel modules\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n - java: dropped `finalize()` for native entities\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n - java: in `compress` pass correct length to native encoder\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n - build: install man pages\r\n - build: updated / fixed / refined Bazel buildfiles\r\n - encoder: faster encoding\r\n - cgo: link via pkg-config\r\n - python: modernize extension / allow multi-phase module initialization\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n - decoder / encoder: static tables use \"small\" model (allows 2GiB+
