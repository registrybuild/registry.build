To convert from `str` to `bytes`, simply call `.encode()` on the `str`.\r\n\r\nIn order to write Python code that works for both Jsonnet versions, the Jsonnet version is now provided as a field of the _jsonnet module, which allows writing code like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport _jsonnet\r\nimport semver\r\n\r\nimport_returns_bytes = semver.compare(getattr(_jsonnet, 'version', 'v0.18.0')[1:], '0.18.0') > 0\r\n\r\ndef no_nl_eof(directory, rel):\r\n    if import_returns_bytes:\r\n        return \"foo.jsonnet\", b\"42\"\r\n    else:\r\n        return \"foo.jsonnet\", \"42\"\r\n\r\n_jsonnet.evaluate_snippet(\"test.jsonnet\", \"{\\nlocal foo = import 'foo.jsonnet',\\n \\n 'bar': foo\\n }\\n\", import_callback=no_nl_eof)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis release also fixes an off-by-one truncation error in the import callback logic of the Python bindings introduced in the previous release.

This means if you habitually use it to format your Jsonnet code, it may change them significantly after this release (hence the major version bump).  We recommend reformatting your code to match these new defaults, but the old behavior is still available via:\r\n\r\n```\r\njsonnet fmt -n 0 --string-style l --comment-style l --no-sort-imports\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Native Go port\r\n\r\nAfter a quiet ramp up, we're announcing the Go port.  It is a complete re-implementation in Go, therefore it is more suitable for running untrusted Jsonnet code server-side.  It is feature complete and will generate the same JSON and the only differences you might see are with some of the error messages and trace backs.  We think it is ready for general use, and many projects are already using it.\r\n\r\nYou should stop using the cgo wrapper now!\r\n\r\nEventually, we would like to deprecate the C++ version, since the Go version has simpler source code (benefiting from go routines and the native garbage collector).

Previously if the super-object did not have the field `f` then `f +: e` was an error.  Now, it succeeds in that case yielding `f: e`.  This extends recursively, so `{ } + { f+: { x +: { y: 1 } } }` yields `{ f: { x: { y: 1 } } }`, and in fact the left hand side `{ }` is not even needed.

release renames all \"library\" jsonnet files to .libsonnet as proposed some months ago.  This is just a convention, it does not affect evaluation of Jsonnet configs.  As with all conventions, users can adopt it... or ignore it :)\n\nThis release also has some new language features:\n\n# Named params, default arguments\n\nAs in Python, you can provide default arguments to functions, e.g.\n\n```\nlocal add(x, y=3) = x + y;\nadd(6)\n```\n\nand also bind arguments to parameters by name instead of by position:\n\n```\nadd(x=6)\n```\n\nThe syntax and semantics matches Python but without _args and *_kwargs.\n\n# Top-level arguments\n\nThis is a more principled way of parameterizing an entire config.  Previously the only way to do that was with `std.extVar`, but this created a global variable of sorts.  Code anywhere in the config could use it and it in large configs this can become a maintenance hurdle.  `std.extVar` still exists but there is a new way where the parameter is scoped only to the main or root file of the config, and has to be explicitly threaded to imported files:\n\nPreviously a Jsonnet file evaluating to a function would be rejected:\n\n```\n$ jsonnet -e 'function() 42'\nRUNTIME ERROR: Couldn't manifest function in JSON output.\n```\n\nNow, such a function is called with no arguments to yield the value that is manifested as JSON.  To add arguments, use the new commandline parameters.\n\n```\nAvailable options for specifying values of 'top-level arguments':\nProvide the value as a string:\n  -A / --tla-str <var>[=<val>]     If <val> is omitted, get from environment var <var>\n       --tla-str-file <var>=<file> Read the string from the file\nProvide a value as Jsonnet code:\n  --tla-code <var>[=<code>]    If <code> is omitted, get from environment var <var>\n  --tla-code-file <var>=<file> Read the code from the file\n```\n\n```\n$ jsonnet -e 'function(a, b, c=3) a + b + c' --tla-code a=1 --tla-code b=2\n6\n```\n\nNote that TLAs provide default arguments for the entire config, something that was not possible (but often requested) with std.extVar().\n\n# Native functions\n\nNow you can, via the C API (or wrappers, e.g. Python) add your own native functions to Jsonnet.  The purpose of these functions is to expose tricky functionality that you wouldn't want to implement in Jsonnet.  E.g. compression, or encryption.  Note that these functions must be pure.  They must have no side-effects and must give the same return value for the same input.  Since Jsonnet is a lazy language, native functions may be called at unusual times, in an unusual order, more times than expected, or not at all.  If the functionality being exposed is not naturally pure (e.g. random secret generation), please wrap it in a cache so that subsequent calls with the same params give the same result.\n\nCurrently native extensions can have an arbitrary number of parameters but each has to be a primitive (i.e. not an object or an array).  One option for now is to wrap the native function in Jsonnet code that calls std.toString() on the value, then parse the JSON on the host language side.\n\nNative extensions can however return arbitrary JSON objects.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2920511","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2920511/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2920511/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/google/jsonnet/releases/tag/v0.8.8","id":2920511,"author":{"login":"sparkprime","id":168158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime","html_url":"https://github.com/sparkprime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI5MjA1MTE=","tag_name":"v0.8.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.8.8","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2016-03-29T00:55:47Z","published_at":"2016-03-30T23:40:10Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/tarball/v0.8.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/zipball/v0.8.8","body":"This release merely fixes some problems with the Bazel build files in the previous release.

The fact this was ever possible was an accident of implementation.  In fact, we expect no-one was actually writing code like { x: /*foo */: 3 }.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's talk about the many new features this release:\n\nThe major announcement is the Jsonnet reformatter, which is in many ways like the Go reformatter, including the way it is invoked:\n\n```\njsonnet fmt foo.jsonnet\n```\n\n(See --help for more details.)\n\nThis tool will clean up whitespace, re-indent, and use syntax sugars where possible.  It can control the way strings are quoted and the comment style.  However it will not (yet) break or join lines.  It is quite extensible so please submit issues for more things you think it should fix.  An obvious candidate is alphabetic re-ordering of imports!\n\nOne thing for which it's very useful is the process of bootstrapping unformatted JSON code into beautiful Jsonnet.  To do this, use a standard JSON reformatter like json_pp to line-break the JSON how you want.  Then run jsonnet fmt on it to strip the quotes from field names where possible and put commas on the end of lines.  That takes care of the most boring aspects of refactoring JSON into Jsonnet!\n\nAnother new feature is to add Python style array slicing.  This is the ability to do\n\n```\nlocal arr = ['it', 'was', 'the', 'best', 'of', 'times'];\nassert arr[2:4] == ['the', 'best'];\nassert arr[1::2] == ['was', 'best', 'times'];\ntrue\n```\n\nThis is designed to be compatible with Python, except the ability to use negative numbers to refer to elements relative to the far end of the array.  The rationale:  We'd rather have an explicit error to catch broken index arithmetic, and you can always use std.length() when you (rarely) need to refer to the last element of an array.\n\nDid you notice the last example used ' for string literals instead of the \" as prescribed by JSON?  This new kind of string literal is useful in cases when you want to embed \" in your string without escaping.  It also has a bit less visual clutter.\n\nAnother innovation is --yaml-stream, which was implemented primarily for easy output into kubectl (from the Kubernetes project).  The idea is that the Jsonnet script manifests into a JSON array, and this is rendered as a \"YAML stream\".  For more context see yaml.org.\n\n```\n$ jsonnet --yaml-stream -e '[{ animal: \"dog\", sound: \"woof\" }, { animal: \"cat\", sound: \"meow\" }]'\n---\n{\n   \"animal\": \"dog\",\n   \"sound\": \"woof\"\n}  \n---\n{\n   \"animal\": \"cat\",\n   \"sound\": \"meow\"\n}  \n...\n```\n\nThe final new feature:  We now have JSON merge patch support (RFC7396) in the standard library.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2276802","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2276802/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/releases/2276802/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/google/jsonnet/releases/tag/v0.8.6","id":2276802,"author":{"login":"sparkprime","id":168158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime","html_url":"https://github.com/sparkprime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkprime/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIyNzY4MDI=","tag_name":"v0.8.6","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.8.6","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2015-12-12T04:55:25Z","published_at":"2015-12-12T05:48:31Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/tarball/v0.8.6","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jsonnet/zipball/v0.8.6","body":"Aside from minor improvements and bug fixes, this release has one change to the language that is not compatible with previous versions.\n\nSome users pointed out that import \"foo\" + bar had surprising behavior, because it looks like it will compute the name of the import, but in actual fact it is parsed as (import \"foo\") + bar, which converts the imported Jsonnet file to a string, then appends bar to it.  In order to avoid that confusion, we've make the parentheses mandatory in those cases.\n\nThe vast majority of imports, which are unambiguous, are not affected.

This is backwards-compatible except if you were using 'assert' as an identifier, in which case you'll have to rename it (or use quotes \"assert\": in the case of a field name).\n\n### Assert expressions\n\n```\nassert e1 : e2; e3\n```\n\nIs simply desugared to\n\n```\nif e1 then e3 else error e2\n```\n\nAnd the : e2 is optional like in Python and Java (except Python uses a comma instead of a colon).\n\n### Object assertions (invariants)\n\nIt is also possible to put asserts into objects:\n\n```\nlocal Base = {\n    assert self.x <= self.y : \"%d greater than %d\" % [self.x, self.y],\n    x: 1,\n    y: 2,\n};\n```\n\nThese are preserved over inheritance and follow the usual late binding semantics.\n\n```\nBase { x: 3 }  // Raises an error.\nBase { x: 3, y: 4 }  // Ok.\n```\n\nThis can be useful for enumerations:\n\n```\nlocal Base = {\n    assert std.setMember(self.animal, self.availableAnimals)\n           : \"%s is not a valid animal\" % self.animal,\n    animal: error \"You must select an animal\",\n    availableAnimals: [\"CAT\", \"DOG\"],\n};\nBase { animal: \"FISH\" }  // Raises an error.\nBase { animal: \"FISH\", availableAnimals+: [\"FISH\"] }  // Ok.\n```\n\nIf you want to constrain the base object so the animals cannot be extended, you can do:\n\n```\nlocal Base = {\n    local available_animals = [\"CAT\", \"DOG\"],\n    assert std.setMember(self.animal, available_animals)\n           : \"%s is not a valid animal\" % self.animal,\n    animal: error \"You must select an animal\",\n};\n```\n\n#### Preventing override of fields\n\nFinally, using this mechanism you can lock down a template so that users can only override the \"inputs\", not the \"outputs\".  For example imagine building bash scripts as part of a workflow framework:\n\n```\nlocal Template = {\n    user:: error \"Must set user\",\n    command:: error \"Must set command\",\n    outputFile:: \"out.log\",\n\n    local template = self,\n    local output = {\n        bash: \"sudo %(user)s \\\"%(command)s\\\" > %(outputFile)s\" % template,\n    },\n    bash: output.bash,\n    assert self == output : \"You may not override this template's output.\"\n};\n// User code:\nTemplate {user: \"myname\", command: \"ls\", bash+:\"; echo hi\"}\n```\n\nThis would produce an error because the assertion prevents the user from adding stuff onto the end of the bash command.\n\n## Removal of super as a construct in its own right\n\nEarly in development we decided to avoid restrictions in the language to see where this would lead us.  Two such cases led to implementation complexity and we were tempted to remove them, but we were not sure if they would be useful.  One case was mixins, which turned out to be enormously useful in many cases.  The other case was the ability to do super by itself, not just in the context of super.f or super[e].  The semantics of this were tricky to define in the case of extending super, or extending super with itself (although we did so, and the rules are on the website)!  It also makes the interpreter and object model harder to implement.
