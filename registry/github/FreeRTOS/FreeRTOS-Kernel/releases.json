A stream batching buffer differs from a stream\r\n      buffer when a task reads from a non-empty buffer:\r\n      - The task reading from a non-empty stream buffer returns immediately\r\n        regardless of the amount of data in the buffer.\r\n      - The task reading from a non-empty steam batching buffer blocks until the\r\n        amount of data in the buffer exceeds the trigger level or the block time\r\n        expires.\r\n      We thank @cperkulator for their contribution.\r\n    + Add the ability to change task notification index for stream buffers. We\r\n      thank @glemco for their contribution.\r\n    + Add xStreamBufferResetFromISR and xMessageBufferResetFromISR APIs to reset\r\n      stream buffer and message buffer from an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).\r\n      We thank @HagaiMoshe for their contribution.\r\n    + Update all the FreeRTOS APIs to use configSTACK_DEPTH_TYPE for stack type.\r\n      We thank @feilipu for their contribution.\r\n    + Update vTaskEndScheduler to delete the timer and idle tasks,\r\n      once the scheduler is stopped.\r\n    + Make xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandleForCore() available to the single core\r\n      scheduler. We thank @Dazza0 for their contribution.\r\n    + Update uxTaskGetSystemState to not use the pxIndex member of the List_t\r\n      structure while iterating ready tasks list. The reason is that pxIndex\r\n      member must only used to select next ready task to run. We thank\r\n      @gemarcano for their inputs.\r\n    + Add a config option to the FreeRTOS SMP Kernel to set the default core\r\n      affinity mask for tasks created without an affinity mask. We thank @go2sh\r\n      for their contribution.\r\n    + Add configUSE_EVENT_GROUPS and configUSE_STREAM_BUFFERS configuration\r\n      constants to control the inclusion of event group and stream buffer\r\n      functionalities.\r\n    + Code changes to comply with MISRA C 2012.\r\n    + Add 64-bit support to the FreeRTOS Windows Simulator port.

We thank @Mixaill for their contribution.\r\n    + Update the POSIX port to ignore the user specified stack memory and only\r\n      pass the stack size to the pthread API to avoid errors caused when stack size\r\n      is smaller than the minimum. We thank @cmorgnaBE for their\r\n      contribution.\r\n    + Update the POSIX port to use a timer thread for tick interrupts instead of\r\n      POSIX timers to address issues with signal handling in non-FreeRTOS\r\n      pthreads.

between FreeRTOS V10.6.2 and FreeRTOS V11.0.0 released December 18, 2023\r\n\r\n    + SMP merged into the mainline:  While FreeRTOS introduced Asymmetric\r\n      Multiprocessing (AMP) support in 2017, FreeRTOS Version 11.0.0 is the\r\n      first to merge Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) support into the mainline\r\n      release. SMP enables one instance of the FreeRTOS Kernel to schedule tasks\r\n      across multiple identical processor cores.  We thank Mike Bruno and Jerry\r\n      McCarthy of XMOS and, Darian Liang, Sudeep Mohanty and Zim Kalinowski of\r\n      Espressif Systems for their contributions.\r\n    + Switch MISRA compliance checking from PC Lint to Coverity, and update from\r\n      MISRA C:2004 to MISRA C:2012.\r\n    + Add a template FreeRTOSConfig.h, inclusive of an abbreviated explanation of\r\n      each configuration item. Application writers can use this template as a\r\n      starting point to create the FreeRTOSConfig.h file for their application.\r\n    + Add a template FreeRTOS port which can be used as a starting point for\r\n      developing a new FreeRTOS port.\r\n    + Add bounds checking and obfuscation to internal heap block pointers in\r\n      heap_4.c and heap_5.c to help catch pointer corruptions. The application can\r\n      enable these checks by setting configENABLE_HEAP_PROTECTOR to 1 in their\r\n      FreeRTOSConfig.h. We thank @oliverlavery for their contribution.\r\n    + Update vTaskList and vTaskGetRunTimeStats APIs to replace the use of sprintf\r\n      with snprintf.\r\n    + Add trace macros to ports that enable tracing the interaction of ISRs with\r\n      scheduler events. We thank @conara for their contribution.\r\n    + Add trace macros that enable tracing of entering and exiting all APIs. We\r\n      thank @Techcore123 for their contribution.\r\n    + Add uxTaskBasePriorityGet and uxTaskBasePriorityGetFromISR APIs to get the\r\n      base priority of a task. The base priority of a task is the priority that\r\n      was last assigned to the task - which due to priority inheritance, may not\r\n      be the current priority of the task.\r\n    + Add pdTICKS_TO_MS macro to convert time in FreeRTOS ticks to time in\r\n      milliseconds. We thank @Dazza0 for their contribution.\r\n    + Add default implementations of vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory and\r\n      vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory. The application can enable these default\r\n      implementations by setting configKERNEL_PROVIDED_STATIC_MEMORY to 1 in their\r\n      FreeRTOSConfig.h. We thank @mdnr-g for their contribution.\r\n    + Update vTaskGetInfo to include start and end of the stack whenever both\r\n      values are available. We thank @vinceburns for their contribution.\r\n    + Prevent tasks waiting for a notification from being resumed by calls to\r\n      vTaskResume or vTaskResumeFromISR. We thank @Moral-Hao for their\r\n      contribution.\r\n    + Add asserts to validate that the application has correctly installed\r\n      FreeRTOS handlers for PendSV and SVCall interrupts on Cortex-M devices.\r\n      We thank @jefftenney for their contribution.\r\n    + Rename ARM_CA53_64_BIT and ARM_CA53_64_BIT_SRE ports to Arm_AARCH64 and\r\n      Arm_AARCH64_SRE respectively as these ports are applicable to all AArch64\r\n      architecture. We thank @urutva for their contribution.\r\n    + Add CMake support to allow the application writer to select the RISC-V\r\n      chip extension. We thank @JoeBenczarski for their contribution.\r\n    + Add CMake support to allow the application writer to build an application\r\n      with static allocation only. We thank @conara for their contribution.\r\n    + Make taskYIELD available to unprivileged tasks for ARMv8-M ports.\r\n    + Update Cortex-M23 ports to not use PSPLIM_NS. We thank @urutva for their\r\n      contribution.\r\n    + Update the SysTick setup code for ARMv8-M ports to first configure the clock\r\n      source and then enable SysTick. This is needed to address a bug in QEMU\r\n      versions older than 7.0.0, which causes an emulation error if SysTick is\r\n      enabled without first selecting a valid clock source. We thank @jefftenney\r\n      for their contribution.\r\n    + Add the port-optimized task selection algorithm optionally available for\r\n      ARMv7-M ports to the ARMv8-M ports. We thank @jefftenney for their\r\n      contribution.\r\n    + Improve the speed of pvPortMalloc in heap_4.c and heap_5.c by removing\r\n      unnecessary steps while splitting a large memory block into two. We thank\r\n      @Moral-Hao for their contribution.\r\n    + Shorten the critical section in pvPortMalloc in heap_2.c, heap_4.c and\r\n      heap_5.c by moving the size calculation out of the critical section. We thank\r\n      @Moral-Hao for their contribution.\r\n    + Update xTaskNotifyWait and ulTaskNotifyTake to remove the non-deterministic\r\n      operation of traversing a linked link from a critical section. We thank\r\n      @karver8 for their contribution.\r\n    + Fix stack end and stack size computation in POSIX port to meet the stack\r\n      alignment requirements on MacOS. We thank @tegimeki for their contribution.\r\n    + Update the vTaskPrioritySet implementation to use the new priority when the\r\n      task has inherited priority from a mutex it is holding, and the new priority\r\n      is bigger than the inherited priority. We thank @Moral-Hao for their\r\n      contribution.\r\n    + Add stack alignment adjustment if stack grows upwards.

The following is the list of changes introduced with the new MPU\r\n\t  wrapper:\r\n\r\n\t  1. Opaque and indirectly verifiable integers for kernel object handles:\r\n\t     All the kernel object handles (for example, queue handles) are now\r\n\t     opaque integers. Previously object handles were raw pointers.\r\n\t  2. Save the task context in Task Control Block (TCB): When a task is\r\n\t     swapped out by the scheduler, the task's context is now saved in its\r\n\t     TCB. Previously the task's context was saved on its stack.\r\n\t  3. Execute system calls on a separate privileged only stack: FreeRTOS\r\n\t     system calls, which execute with elevated privilege, now use a\r\n\t     separate privileged only stack. Previously system calls used the\r\n\t     calling task's stack. The application writer can control the size of\r\n\t     the system call stack using new configSYSTEM_CALL_STACK_SIZE config\r\n\t     macro.\r\n\t  4. Memory bounds checks: FreeRTOS system calls which accept a pointer\r\n\t     and de-reference it, now verify that the calling task has required\r\n\t     permissions to access the memory location referenced by the pointer.\r\n\t  5. System calls restrictions: The following system calls are no longer\r\n\t     available to unprivileged tasks:\r\n\t      - vQueueDelete\r\n\t      - xQueueCreateMutex\r\n\t      - xQueueCreateMutexStatic\r\n\t      - xQueueCreateCountingSemaphore\r\n\t      - xQueueCreateCountingSemaphoreStatic\r\n\t      - xQueueGenericCreate\r\n\t      - xQueueGenericCreateStatic\r\n\t      - xQueueCreateSet\r\n\t      - xQueueRemoveFromSet\r\n\t      - xQueueGenericReset\r\n\t      - xTaskCreate\r\n\t      - xTaskCreateStatic\r\n\t      - vTaskDelete\r\n\t      - vTaskPrioritySet\r\n\t      - vTaskSuspendAll\r\n\t      - xTaskResumeAll\r\n\t      - xTaskGetHandle\r\n\t      - xTaskCallApplicationTaskHook\r\n\t      - vTaskList\r\n\t      - vTaskGetRunTimeStats\r\n\t      - xTaskCatchUpTicks\r\n\t      - xEventGroupCreate\r\n\t      - xEventGroupCreateStatic\r\n\t      - vEventGroupDelete\r\n\t      - xStreamBufferGenericCreate\r\n\t      - xStreamBufferGenericCreateStatic\r\n\t      - vStreamBufferDelete\r\n\t      - xStreamBufferReset\r\n\t     Also, an unprivileged task can no longer use vTaskSuspend to suspend\r\n\t     any task other than itself.\r\n\r\n\t  We thank the following people for their inputs in these enhancements:\r\n\t    - David Reiss of Meta Platforms, Inc.\r\n\t    - Lan Luo, Xinhui Shao, Yumeng Wei, Zixia Liu, Huaiyu Yan and Zhen Ling\r\n\t      of School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University,\r\n\t      China.\r\n\t    - Xinwen Fu of Department of Computer Science, University of\r\n\t      Massachusetts Lowell, USA.\r\n\t    - Yueqi Chen, Zicheng Wang, Minghao Lin, Jiahe Wang of University of\r\n\t      Colorado Boulder, USA.\r\n\t+ Add Cortex-M35P port.

Contributed by\r\n\t  @chrisnc.\r\n\t+ Add APIs to get the application supplied buffers from statically\r\n\t  created kernel objects. The following new APIs are added:\r\n\t  - xTaskGetStaticBuffers\r\n\t  - xQueueGetStaticBuffers\r\n\t  - xQueueGenericGetStaticBuffers\r\n\t  - xSemaphoreGetStaticBuffer\r\n\t  - xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer\r\n\t  - xStreamBufferGetStaticBuffers\r\n\t  - xMessageBufferGetStaticBuffers\r\n\t  These APIs enable the application writer to obtain static buffers from\r\n\t  the kernel object and free/reuse them at the time of deletion. Earlier\r\n\t  the application writer had to maintain the association of static buffers\r\n\t  and the kernel object in the application.

MPU_xTaskCreate\r\n\t  and MPU_xTaskCreateStatic have been updated to only allow creation of\r\n\t  unprivileged tasks. MPU_xTimerCreate, MPU_xTimerCreateStatic and\r\n\t  MPU_xTimerPendFunctionCall APIs have been removed.\r\n\t  We thank Huazhong University of Science and Technology for reporting\r\n\t  this issue.\r\n\t+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for a third party that\r\n\t  already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to\r\n\t  achieve further privilege escalation by branching directly inside a\r\n\t  FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually crafted stack frame.\r\n\t  The local stack variable `xRunningPrivileged` has been removed so that\r\n\t  a manually crafted stack frame cannot be used for privilege escalation\r\n\t  by branching directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper.\r\n\t  We thank Certibit Consulting, LLC, Huazhong University of Science and\r\n\t  Technology and the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting\r\n\t  this issue.\r\n\t+ ARMv7-M MPU ports: It was possible to configure overlapping memory\r\n\t  protection unit (MPU) regions such that an unprivileged task could access\r\n\t  privileged data. The kernel now uses highest numbered MPU regions for\r\n\t  kernel protections to prevent such MPU configurations.\r\n\t  We thank the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting this\r\n\t  issue.\r\n\t+ Add support for ARM Cortex-M55.\r\n\t+ Add support for ARM Cortex-M85. Contributed by @gbrtth.\r\n\t+ Add vectored mode interrupt support to the RISC-V port.\r\n\t+ Add support for RV32E extension (Embedded Profile) in RISC-V GCC port.\r\n\t  Contributed by @Limoto.\r\n\t+ Heap improvements:\r\n\t  - Add a check to heap_2 to track if a memory block is allocated to\r\n\t    the application or not. The MSB of the size field is used for this\r\n\t    purpose. The same check already exists in heap_4 and heap_5. This\r\n\t    check prevents double free errors.\r\n\t  - Add a new flag configHEAP_CLEAR_MEMORY_ON_FREE to heap_2, heap_4\r\n\t    and heap_5. If the flag is set in FreeRTOSConfig.h then memory freed using\r\n\t    vPortFree() is automatically cleared to zero.\r\n\t  - Add a new API pvPortCalloc to heap_2, heap_4 and heap_5 which has the same\r\n\t    signature as the standard library calloc function.\r\n\t  - Update the pointer types to portPOINTER_SIZE_TYPE. Contributed by\r\n\t    @Octaviarius.\r\n\t+ Add the ability to override send and receive completed callbacks for each\r\n\t  instance of a stream buffer or message buffer. Earlier there could be\r\n\t  one send and one receive callback for all instances of stream and message\r\n\t  buffers. Having separate callbacks per instance allows different message\r\n\t  and stream buffers to be used differently - for example, some for inter core\r\n\t  communication and others for same core communication.\r\n\t  The feature can be controlled by setting  the configuration option\r\n\t  configUSE_SB_COMPLETED_CALLBACK in FreeRTOSConfig.h. When the option is set to 1,\r\n\t  APIs xStreamBufferCreateWithCallback() or xStreamBufferCreateStaticWithCallback()\r\n\t  (and likewise APIs for message buffer) can be used to create a stream buffer \r\n\t  or message buffer instance with application provided callback overrides. When\r\n\t  the option is set to 0, then the default callbacks as defined by\r\n\t  sbSEND_COMPLETED() and sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED() macros are invoked. To maintain \r\n\t  backwards compatibility, configUSE_SB_COMPLETED_CALLBACK defaults to 0. The \r\n\t  functionality is currently not supported for MPU enabled ports.\r\n\t+ Generalize the FreeRTOS's Thread Local Storage (TLS) support so that it\r\n\t  is not tied to newlib and can be used with other c-runtime libraries also.\r\n\t  The default behavior for newlib support is kept same for backward\r\n\t  compatibility.\r\n\t+ Add support to build and link FreeRTOS using CMake build system. Contributed\r\n\t  by @yhsb2k.\r\n\t+ Add support to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for every release.\r\n\t+ Add support for 16 MPU regions to the GCC Cortex-M33 ports.\r\n\t+ Add ARM Cortex-M7 r0p0/r0p1 Errata 837070 workaround to ARM CM4 MPU ports.\r\n\t  The application writer needs to define configENABLE_ERRATA_837070_WORKAROUND\r\n\t  when using CM4 MPU ports on a Cortex-M7 r0p0/r0p1 core.\r\n\t+ Add configSYSTICK_CLOCK_HZ to Cortex-M0 ports. This is needed to support\r\n\t  the case when the SysTick timer is not clocked from the same source as the CPU.\r\n\t+ Add hardware stack protection support to MicroBlazeV9 port. This ensures that\r\n\t  the CPU immediately raises Stack Protection Violation exception as soon as any\r\n\t  task violates its stack limits. Contributed by @uecasm.\r\n\t+ Introduce the configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM configuration option. When this\r\n\t  option is set to 1, ListItem_t and MiniLitItem_t remain separate types.\r\n\t  However, when configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM == 0, MiniLitItem_t and ListItem_t\r\n\t  are both typedefs of the same struct xLIST_ITEM. This addresses some issues\r\n\t  observed when strict-aliasing and link time optimization are enabled.\r\n\t  To maintain backwards compatibility, configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM defaults to 1.\r\n\t+ Simplify prvInitialiseNewTask to memset newly allocated TCB structures\r\n\t  to zero, and remove code that set individual structure members to zero.\r\n\t+ Add prototype for prvPortYieldFromISR to the POSIX port so that it builds\r\n\t  without any warning with -Wmissing-prototypes compiler option.\r\n\t+ Add top of stack and end of stack to the task info report obtained using\r\n\t  vTaskGetInfo(). Contributed by @shreyasbharath.\r\n\t+ Add a cap to the cRxLock and cTxLock members of the queue data structure.\r\n\t  These locks count the number items received and sent to the queue while\r\n\t  the queue was locked. These are later used to unblock tasks waiting on\r\n\t  the queue when the queue is unlocked. This PR caps the values of the\r\n\t  cRxLock and cTxLock to the number of tasks in the system because we cannot\r\n\t  unblock more tasks than there are in the system. Note that the same assert\r\n\t  could still be triggered is the application creates more than 127 tasks.\r\n\t+ Changed uxAutoReload parameter in timer functions to xAutoReload.  The\r\n\t  type is now BaseType_t.  This matches the type of pdTRUE and pdFALSE.\r\n\t  The new function xTimerGetAutoReload() provides the auto-reload state as\r\n\t  a BaseType_t.  The legacy function uxTimerGetAutoReload is retained with the\r\n\t  original UBaseType_t return value.\r\n\t+ Fix support for user implementations of tickless idle that call\r\n\t  vTaskStepTick() with xExpectedIdleTime ticks to step. The new code\r\n\t  ensures xTickCount reaches xNextTaskUnblockTime inside xTaskIncrementTick()\r\n\t  instead of inside vTaskStepTick(). This fixes the typical case where a task\r\n\t  wakes up one tick late and a rare case assertion failure when xTickCount\\\r\n\t  rolls over.

Contributed by @pramithkv.\r\n\t+ Update the RL78 IAR port to the latest version of IAR which uses the\r\n\t  industry standard ELF format as opposed to earlier UBROF object format.\r\n\t  Contributed by @felipe-iar.\r\n\t+ Add tick type is atomic flag when tick count is 16-bit to PIC24 port. This\r\n\t  allows the PIC24 family of 16 bit processors to read the tick count without\r\n\t  a critical section when the tick count is also 16 bits.\r\n\t+ Fix offset-out-of-range errors for GCC CM3/CM4 mpu ports when\r\n\t  Link Time Optimization is enabled. Contributed by @niniemann.\r\n\t+ Remove #error when RISC-V port is compiled on a 64-bit RISC-V platform.\r\n\t  Contributed by @cmdrf.\r\n\t+ Fix ullPortInterruptNesting alignment in Cortex-A53 port so that it is\r\n\t  8-byte aligned.

A consequence of this change is that auto-\r\n      reload timers that miss their intended next execution time will execute\r\n      again immediately rather than executing again the next time the command\r\n      queue is processed.  (thanks Jeff Tenney).\r\n    + Fix a race condition in the message buffer implementation.  The\r\n      underlying cause was that length and data bytes are written and read as\r\n      two distinct operations, which both modify the size of the buffer. If a\r\n      context switch occurs after adding or removing the length bytes, but\r\n      before adding or removing the data bytes, then another task may observe\r\n      the message buffer in an invalid state.\r\n    + The xTaskCreate() and xTaskCreateStatic() functions accept a task priority\r\n      as an input parameter.  The priority has always been silently capped to\r\n      (configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1) should it be set to a value above that priority.\r\n      Now values above that priority will also trigger a configASSERT() failure.\r\n\t+ Replace configASSERT( pcQueueName ) in vQueueAddToRegistry with a NULL\r\n      pointer check.\r\n    + Introduce the configSTACK_ALLOCATION_FROM_SEPARATE_HEAP configuration\r\n      constant that enables the stack allocated to tasks to come from a heap other\r\n      than the heap used by other memory allocations.  This enables stacks to be\r\n      placed within special regions, such as fast tightly coupled memory.\r\n    + If there is an attempt to add the same queue or semaphore handle to the\r\n      queue registry more than once then prior versions would create two separate\r\n      entries.  Now if this is done the first entry is overwritten rather than\r\n      duplicated.\r\n    + Update the ESP32 port and TF-M (Trusted Firmware M)code to the latest from\r\n      their respective repositories.\r\n    + Correct a build error in the POSIX port.\r\n    + Additional minor formatting updates, including replacing tabs with spaces\r\n      in more files.\r\n    + Other minor updates include adding additional configASSERT() checks and\r\n      correcting and improving code comments.\r\n    + Go look at the smp branch to see the progress towards the Symetric\r\n      Multiprocessing Kernel. https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tree/smp\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/releases/35250793","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/releases/35250793/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/releases/35250793/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/releases/tag/V10.4.3","id":35250793,"author":{"login":"cobusve","id":35851496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODUxNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35851496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve","html_url":"https://github.com/cobusve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobusve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM1MjUwNzkz","tag_name":"V10.4.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"V10.4.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-12-15T15:18:49Z","published_at":"2020-12-15T15:29:31Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tarball/V10.4.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/zipball/V10.4.3","body":"Changes between FreeRTOS V10.4.2 and FreeRTOS V10.4.3 released December 14 2020\r\n\r\n\tV10.4.3 is included in the 202012.00 LTS release.

between FreeRTOS V10.3.1 and FreeRTOS V10.4.0 released September 10 2020\r\n\r\n\tSee https://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-V10.4.x.html\r\n\r\n\tMajor enhancements:\r\n\r\n\t+ Task notifications:  Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each created task had a\r\n\t  single direct to task notification.  From FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each task has\r\n\t  an array of notifications.  The direct to task notification API has been\r\n\t  extended with API functions postfixed with \"Indexed\" to enable the API to\r\n\t  operate on a task notification at any array index.  See\r\n\t  https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for more information.\r\n\t+ Kernel ports that support memory protection units (MPUs): The ARMv7-M and\r\n\t  ARMv8-M MPU ports now support a privilege access only heap. The ARMv7-M\r\n\t  MPU ports now support devices that have 16 MPU regions, have the ability\r\n\t  to override default memory attributes for privileged code and data\r\n\t  regions, and have the ability to place the FreeRTOS kernel code outside of\r\n\t  the Flash memory. The ARMv8-M MPU ports now support tickless idle mode.\r\n\t  See https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-MPU-memory-protection-unit.html\r\n\t  for more information.\r\n\r\n\tAdditional noteworthy updates:\r\n\r\n\t+ Code formatting is now automated to facilitate the increase in\r\n\t  collaborative development in Git.  The auto-formated code is not identical\r\n\t  to the original formatting conventions.  Most notably spaces are now used\r\n\t  in place of tabs.\r\n\t+ The prototypes for callback functions (those that start with \"Application\",\r\n\t  such as vApplicationStackOverflowHook()) are now in the FreeRTOS header\r\n\t  files, removing the need for application writers to add prototypes into\r\n\t  the C files in which they define the functions.\r\n\t+ New Renesas RXv3 port layer.\r\n\t+ Updates to the Synopsys ARC code, including support for EM and HS cores,\r\n\t  and updated BSP.\r\n\t+ Added new POSIX port layer that allows FreeRTOS to run on Linux hosts in\r\n\t  the same way the Windows port layer enables FreeRTOS to run on Windows\r\n\t  hosts.\r\n\t+ Many other minor optimisations and enhancements.
