Fixes\r\n* Fixed building on non-desktop GDK platforms (#3029)\r\n* Fixed message macros being susceptible to race in specific scenario (#3031)\r\n* Catch2's SEH filter will call the previously

Improved performance of assertions by up-to 10%\r\n  * Release mode assertion fast-path sees the biggest improvement.\r\n* Faster processing of non-escaped strings in `--invisibles` mode.\r\n* Added support for Bazel's `TEST_RANDOM_SEED` env var (#3021)\r\n* Added support for Bazel's `TEST_PREMATURE_EXIT_FILE` env var (#3020)\r\n  * This creates a file that is deleted if the tests exit normally,

safe.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/242372349/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":3,"eyes":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/238720810","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/238720810/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/238720810/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v3.9.1","id":238720810,"author":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABA2rM4OOpcq","tag_name":"v3.9.1","target_commitish":"devel","name":"v3.9.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-08-08T22:30:54Z","updated_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:35Z","published_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:35Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/280750842","id":280750842,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Qu-r6","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"text/plain","state":"uploaded","size":429653,"digest":"sha256:0c9f3438f8a0e3760d8f521acd4d7d6dc425cb75efdb3110c38952eb2b37ca22","download_count":191,"created_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:28Z","updated_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:31Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.9.1/catch_amalgamated.cpp"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/280750853","id":280750853,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Qu-sF","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":833,"digest":"sha256:d45a9e7fda4dcf6507735bf9b82066dfb65ddb1d11fecf245658cbae9a860832","download_count":17,"created_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:33Z","updated_at":"2025-08-08T22:36:33Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.9.1/catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/280750848","id":280750848,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Qu-sA","name":"catch_amalgamated.hpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413

Improvements\r\n* **Added experimental opt-in support for thread safe assertions**\r\n  * Read the documentation for full details\r\n* **The default test run order has been changed to random**\r\n* Passing assertions are significantly faster when the reporter does not ask for `assertionEnded` events on passing assertions.\r\n  * This is the default behaviour of e.g. Console or Compact reporter\r\n  * Simple `REQUIRE(true)` is 60% faster in Release and 80% faster in Debug build configuration\r\n  * Simple `REQUIRE_NOTHROW` is 230% faster in Release and 430% faster in Debug build configuration\r\n  * Simple `REQUIRE_THROWS` is ~3% faster in Release and 20% faster in Debug build configuration (throwing introduces enough overhead that the optimizations inside Catch2 are mostly irrelevant)\r\n* Small (2-5%) improvement if the reporter asks for `assertionEnded` events for passing assertions.\r\n* The exit code constants are part of the Session API. (#2955, #2976)\r\n* Suppressed unsigned integer overflow checking in locations with intended overflow (#2965)\r\n* Reporters flush output after writing metadata, e.g. rng seed (#2964)\r\n* Added unreachable after `FAIL` and `SKIP` macros (#2941)\r\n  * This allows the compiler to understand that the execution does not continue past the macro, and avoids warnings.\r\n* Added fast path for `assertionStarting` event when no reporter requires it\r\n  * For backwards compatibility, this fast path is opt-in\r\n  * A reporter can opt in by changing its `ReporterPreferences::shouldReportAllAssertionStarts`\r\n* Improved last seen source location tracking to be more precise\r\n  * This is used when reporting unexpected exceptions from tests\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Fixed formatting of tags with more than 100 tests in the default `--list-tags` output (#2963)\r\n* Fixed Clang-Tidy's `readability-static-accessed-through-instance` in tests\r\n* Fixed most of Clang-Tidy's `cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables` (#2582)\r\n* The lifetime of scoped messages now strictly obeys their scope (#1759, #2019, #2959)\r\n  * Previously Catch2 would try to keep them around during unexpected exception, to provide helpful context.\r\n  * The amount of surprises the irregularities caused was not worth the occasional utility provided.\r\n* `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG` can handle signatures consisting of only types (#2680, #2995)\r\n* Moved `catch_test_run_info.hpp` up from `internal/` subfolder into the main one (#2972)\r\n\r\n###

Improvements\r\n* Added `std::initializer_list` overloads for `(Unordered)RangeEquals` matcher (#2915, #2919)\r\n* Added explicit casts to silence GCC's `Wconversion` (#2875)\r\n* Made the use of `builtin_constant_p` tricks in assertion macros configurable (#2925)\r\n  * It is used to prod GCC-like compilers into providing warnings for the asserted expressions, but the compilers miscompile it annoyingly often.\r\n* Cleaned out Clang-Tidy's `performance-enum-size` warnings\r\n* Added support for using `from_range` generator with iterators with `value_type = const T` (#2926)\r\n  * This is not correct `value_type` typedef, but it is used in the wild and the change does not make the code meaningfully worse.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Fixed crash when stringifying pre-1970 (epoch) dates on Windows (#2944)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n* Fixes and improvements for `catch_discover_tests` CMake helper\r\n  * Removed redundant `CTEST_FILE` param when creating the indirection file for `PRE_TEST` discovery mode (#2936)\r\n  * Rewrote the test discovery logic to use output from the JSON reporter\r\n    * This means that `catch_discover_tests` now requires CMake 3.19 or newer\r\n  * Added `ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS` option.

Improvements\r\n* Slightly improved compile times of benchmarks\r\n* Made the resolution estimation in benchmarks slightly more precise\r\n* Added new test case macro, `TEST_CASE_PERSISTENT_FIXTURE` (#2885, #1602)\r\n  * Unlike `TEST_CASE_METHOD`, the same underlying instance is used for all partial runs of that test case\r\n* **MASSIVELY** improved performance of the JUnit reporter when handling successful assertions (#2897)\r\n  * For 1 test case and 10M assertions, the new reporter runs 3x faster and uses up only 8 MB of memory, while the old one needs 7 GB of memory.\r\n* Reworked how output redirects works.\r\n  * Combining a reporter writing to stdout with capturing reporter no longer leads to the capturing reporter seeing all of the other reporter's output.\r\n  * The file based redirect no longer opens up a new temporary file for each partial test case run, so it will not run out of temporary files when running many tests in single process.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n*

Fixes\r\n* Fixed potential compilation error when asked to generate random integers whose type did not match `std::(u)int*_t`.\r\n  * This manifested itself when generating random `size_t`s on MacOS\r\n* Added missing outlined destructor causing `Wdelete-incomplete` when compiling against libstdc++ in C++23 mode (#2852)\r\n* Fixed regression where decomposing assertion with const instance of `std::foo_ordering` would not compile\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Reintroduced support for GCC 5 and 6 (#2836)\r\n  * As with VS2017, if they start causing trouble again, they will be dropped again.\r\n* Added workaround for targetting newest MacOS (Sonoma) using GCC (#2837, #2839)\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_DEFAULT_REPORTER` can now be an arbitrary reporter spec\r\n  * Previously it could only be a plain reporter name, so it was impossible to compile in custom arguments to the reporter.\r\n* Improved performance of generating 64bit random integers by 20+%\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n*

Fixes\r\n* Fixed OOB access when computing filename tag (from the `-#` flag) for file without extension (#2798)\r\n* Fixed the linking against `log` on Android to be `PRIVATE` (#2815)\r\n* Fixed `Wuseless-cast` in benchmarking internals (#2823)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Restored compatibility with VS2017 (#2792, #2822)\r\n  * The baseline for Catch2 is still C++14 with some reasonable workarounds for specific compilers, so if VS2017 starts acting up again, the support will be dropped again.\r\n* Suppressed clang-tidy's `bugprone-chained-comparison` in assertions (#2801)\r\n* Improved the static analysis mode to evaluate arguments to `TEST_CASE` and `SECTION` (#2817)\r\n  * Clang-tidy should no longer warn about runtime arguments to these macros being unused in static analysis mode.\r\n  * Clang-tidy can warn on issues involved arguments to these macros.\r\n* Added support for literal-zero detectors based on `consteval` constructors\r\n  * This is required for compiling `REQUIRE((a <=> b) == 0)` against MSVC's stdlib.\r\n  * Sadly, MSVC still cannot compile this assertion as it does not implement C++20 correctly.\r\n  * You can use `clang-cl` with MSVC's stdlib instead.\r\n  * If for some godforsaken reasons you want to understand this better, read the two relevant commits: [`dc51386b9fd61f99ea9c660d01867e6ad489b403`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/commit/dc51386b9fd61f99ea9c660d01867e6ad489b403), and

reproducibility on non-SSE2 x86 targets (#2796)\r\n* Modified the in-tree Conan recipe to support Conan 2

Improvements\r\n* Introduced `CATCH_CONFIG_PREFIX_MESSAGES` to prefix only logging macros (#2544)\r\n  * This means `INFO`, `UNSCOPED_INFO`, `WARN` and `CAPTURE`.\r\n* Section hints in static analysis mode are now `const`\r\n  * This prevents Clang-Tidy from complaining about `misc-const-correctness`.\r\n* `from_range` generator supports C arrays and ranges that require ADL (#2737)\r\n* Stringification support for `std::optional` now also includes `std::nullopt` (#2740)\r\n* The Console reporter flushes output after writing benchmark runtime estimate.\r\n  * This means that you can immediately see for how long the benchmark is expected to run.\r\n* Added workaround to enable compilation with ICC 19.1 (#2551, #2766)\r\n* Compiling Catch2 for XBox should work out of the box (#2772)\r\n  * Catch2 should automatically disable getenv when compiled for XBox.\r\n* Compiling Catch2 with exceptions disabled no longer triggers `Wunused-function` (#2726)\r\n* **`random` Generators for integral types are now reproducible across different platforms**\r\n  * Unlike `<random>`, Catch2's generators also support 1 byte integral types (`char`, `bool`, ...)\r\n* **`random` Generators for `float` and `double` are now reproducible across different platforms**\r\n  * `long double` varies across different platforms too much to be reproducible\r\n  * This guarantee applies only to platforms with IEEE 754 floats.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* UDL declaration inside Catch2 are now strictly conforming to the standard\r\n  * `operator \"\" _a` is UB, `operator \"\"_a` is fine. Seriously.\r\n* Fixed `CAPTURE` tests failing to compile in C++23 mode (#2744)\r\n* Fixed missing include in `catch_message.hpp` (#2758)\r\n* Fixed `CHECK_ELSE` suppressing failure from uncaught exceptions(#2723)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n* The documentation for specifying which tests to run through commandline has been completely rewritten (#2738)\r\n* Fixed installation when building

`SECTION`/`TEST_CASE`.\r\n  * Removed 2 allocations per test case exit, if stdout/stderr is captured\r\n* Improved performance\r\n  * Section tracking is 10%-25% faster than in v3.3.0\r\n  * Assertion handling is 5%-10% faster than in v3.3.0\r\n  * Test case registration is 1%-2% faster than in v3.3.0\r\n  * Tiny speedup for registering listeners\r\n  * Tiny speedup for `CAPTURE`, `TEST_CASE_METHOD`, `METHOD_AS_TEST_CASE`, and `TEMPLATE_LIST_TEST_*` macros.\r\n* `Contains`, `RangeEquals` and `UnorderedRangeEquals` matchers now support ranges with iterator + sentinel pair\r\n*

3.2.0\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Catch2 now compiles on PlayStation (#2562)\r\n* Added `CATCH_CONFIG_GETENV` compile-time toggle (#2562)\r\n  * This toggle guards whether Catch2 calls `std::getenv` when reading env variables\r\n* Added support for more Bazel test environment variables\r\n  * `TESTBRIDGE_TEST_ONLY` is now supported (#2490)\r\n  * Sharding variables, `TEST_SHARD_INDEX`, `TEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`, `TEST_SHARD_STATUS_FILE`, are now all supported (#2491)\r\n* Bunch of small tweaks and improvements in reporters\r\n  * The TAP and SonarQube reporters output the used test filters\r\n  * The XML reporter now also reports the version of its output format\r\n  * The compact reporter now uses the same summary output as the console reporter (#878, #2554)\r\n* Added support for asserting on types that can only be compared with literal 0 (#2555)\r\n  * A canonical example is C++20's `std::*_ordering` types, which cannot be compared with an `int` variable, only `0`\r\n  * The support extends to any type with this property, not just the ones in stdlib\r\n  * This change imposes 2-3% slowdown on compiling files that are heavy on `REQUIRE` and friends\r\n  * **This required significant rewrite of decomposition, there might be bugs**\r\n* Simplified internals of matcher related macros\r\n  * This provides about ~2% speed up compiling files that are heavy on `REQUIRE_THAT` and friends\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Cleaned out some warnings and static analysis issues\r\n  * Suppressed `-Wcomma` warning rarely occuring in templated test cases (#2543)\r\n  *

Improvements\r\n* Improved suppression of `-Wparentheses` for older GCCs\r\n  * Turns out that even GCC 9 does not properly handle `_Pragma`s in the C++ frontend.\r\n* Added type constraints onto `random` generator (#2433)\r\n  * These constraints copy what the standard says for the underlying `std::uniform_int_distribution`\r\n* Suppressed -Wunused-variable from nvcc (#2306, #2427)\r\n* Suppressed -Wunused-variable from MinGW (#2132)\r\n* Added All/Any/NoneTrue range matchers (#2319)\r\n  * These check that all/any/none of boolean values in a range are true.\r\n* The JUnit reporter now normalizes classnames from C++ namespaces to Java-like namespaces (#2468)\r\n  * This provides better support for other JUnit based tools.\r\n* The Bazel support now understands `BAZEL_TEST` environment variable (#2459)\r\n  * The `CATCH_CONFIG_BAZEL_SUPPORT` configuration option is also still supported.\r\n* Returned support for compiling Catch2 with GCC 5 (#2448)\r\n  * This required removing inherited constructors from Catch2's internals.\r\n  * I recommend updating to a newer GCC anyway.\r\n* `catch_discover_tests` now has a new options for setting library load path(s) when running the Catch2 binary (#2467)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Fixed crash when listing listeners without any registered listeners (#2442)\r\n* Fixed nvcc compilation error in constructor benchmarking helper (#2477)\r\n* Catch2's CMakeList supports pre-3.12 CMake again (#2428)\r\n  * The gain from requiring CMake 3.12 was very minor, but y'all should really update to newer CMake\r\n\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n* Fixed SelfTest build on MinGW (#2447)\r\n* The in-repo conan recipe exports the CMake helper (#2460)\r\n* Added experimental CMake script to showcase using test case sharding together with CTest\r\n  * Compared to `catch_discover_tests`, it supports very limited number of options and customization\r\n* Added documentation page on best practices when running Catch2 tests\r\n* Catch2 can be built as a dynamic library (#2397, #2398)\r\n  * Note that Catch2 does not have visibility annotations, and you are responsible for ensuring correct visibility built into the resulting library.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/72177296/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":9,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/67120792","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/67120792/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/67120792/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v3.0.1","id":67120792,"author":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABA2rM4EAC6Y","tag_name":"v3.0.1","target_commitish":"devel","name":"v3.0.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-05-17T21:32:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T21:57:37Z","published_at":"2022-05-17T21:35:31Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/65821400","id":65821400,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4D7FrY","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"text/plain","state":"uploaded","size":379817,"digest":null,"download_count":587,"created_at":"2022-05-17T21:35:22Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T21:35:23Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.0.1/catch_amalgamated.cpp"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/65821406","id":65821406,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4D7Fre","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":833,"digest":null,"download_count":66,"created_at":"2022-05-17T21:35:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T21:35:24Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.0.1/catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/65821405","id":65821405,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4D7Frd","name":"catch_amalgamated.hpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.

now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model.\r\nThis also means that to get all of Catch2's functionality in a test file,\r\nyou have to include multiple headers.**\r\n\r\nYou probably want to look into the [migration docs](docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top),\r\nwhich were written to help people coming from v2.x.x versions to the\r\nv3 releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n* Why is Catch2 moving to separate headers?\r\n  * The short answer is future extensibility and scalability. The long answer is complex and can be found on my blog, but at the most basic level, it is that providing single-header distribution is at odds with providing variety of useful features. When Catch2 was distributed in a single header, adding a new Matcher would cause overhead for everyone, but was useful only to a subset of users. This meant that the barrier to entry for new Matchers/Generators/etc is high in single header model, but much smaller in the new model.\r\n* Will Catch2 again distribute single-header version in the future?\r\n  * No. But we do provide sqlite-style amalgamated distribution option. This means that you can download just 1 .cpp file and 1 header and place them next to your own sources. However, doing this has downsides similar to using the `catch_all.hpp` header.\r\n* Why the big breaking change caused by replacing `catch.hpp` with `catch_all.hpp`?\r\n  * The convenience header `catch_all.hpp` exists for two reasons. One of them is to provide a way for quick migration from Catch2, the second one is to provide a simple way to test things with Catch2. Using it for migration has one drawback in that it is **big**. This means that including it _will_ cause significant compile time drag, and so using it to migrate should be a conscious decision by the user, not something they can just stumble into unknowingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### (Potentially) Breaking changes\r\n* **Catch2 now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model**\r\n  * **Including `catch.hpp` no longer works**\r\n* **Catch2 now uses C++14 as the minimum support language version**\r\n* `ANON_TEST_CASE` has been removed, use `TEST_CASE` with no arguments instead (#1220)\r\n* `--list*` commands no longer have non-zero return code (#1410)\r\n* `--list-test-names-only` has been removed (#1190)\r\n  * You should use verbosity-modifiers for `--list-tests` instead\r\n* `--list*` commands are now piped through the reporters\r\n  * The top-level reporter interface provides default implementation that works just as the old one\r\n  * XmlReporter outputs a machine-parseable XML\r\n* `TEST_CASE` description support has been removed\r\n  * If the second argument has text outside tags, the text will be ignored.\r\n* Hidden test cases are no longer included just because they don't match an exclusion tag\r\n  * Previously, a `TEST_CASE(\"A\", \"[.foo]\")` would be included by asking for `~[bar]`.\r\n* `PredicateMatcher` is no longer type erased.\r\n  * This means that the type of the provided predicate is part of the `PredicateMatcher`'s type\r\n* `SectionInfo` no longer contains section description as a member (#1319)\r\n  * You can still write `SECTION(\"ShortName\", \"Long and wordy description\")`, but the description is thrown away\r\n  * The description type now must be a `const char*` or be implicitly convertible to it\r\n* The `[!hide]` tag has been removed.\r\n  * Use `[.]` or `[.foo]` instead.\r\n* Lvalues of composed matchers cannot be composed further\r\n* Uses of `REGISTER_TEST_CASE` macro need to be followed by a semicolon\r\n  * This does not change `TEST_CASE` and friends in any way\r\n* `IStreamingReporter::IsMulti` member function was removed\r\n  * This is _very_ unlikely to actually affect anyone, as it was default-implemented in the interface, and only used internally\r\n* Various classes not designed for user-extension have been made final\r\n  * `ListeningReporter` is now `final`\r\n  * Concrete Matchers (e.g. `UnorderedEquals` vector matcher) are now `final`\r\n  * All Generators are now `final`\r\n* Matcher namespacing has been redone\r\n  * Matcher types are no longer in deeply nested namespaces\r\n  * Matcher factory functions are no longer brought into `Catch` namespace\r\n  * This means that all public-facing matcher-related functionality is now in `Catch::Matchers` namespace\r\n* Defining `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` will no longer create main in that TU.\r\n  * Link with `libCatch2Main.a`, or the proper CMake/pkg-config target\r\n  * If you want to write custom main, include `catch2/catch_session.hpp`\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES` has been removed.\r\n  * You should instead include the appropriate headers as needed.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_IMPL` has been removed.\r\n  * The implementation is now compiled into a static library.\r\n* Event Listener interface has changed\r\n  * `TestEventListenerBase` was renamed to `EventListenerBase`\r\n  * `EventListenerBase` now directly derives from `IStreamingReporter`, instead of deriving from `StreamingReporterBase`\r\n* `GENERATE` decays its arguments (#2012, #2040)\r\n  * This means that `str` in `auto str = GENERATE(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\");` is inferred to `char const*` rather than `const char[2]`.\r\n* `--list-*` flags write their output to file specified by the `-o` flag\r\n* Many changes to reporter interfaces\r\n  * With the exception of the XmlReporter, the outputs of first party reporters should remain the same\r\n  * New pair of events were added\r\n  * One obsolete event was removed\r\n  * The base class has been renamed\r\n  * The built-in reporter class hierarchy has been redone\r\n* Catch2 generates a random seed if one hasn't been specified by the user\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tests`, `-l`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tags`, `-t`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n* The `--colour` option has been replaced with `--colour-mode` option\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Matchers have been extended with the ability to use different signatures of `match` (#1307, #1553, #1554, #1843)\r\n  * This includes having templated `match` member function\r\n  * See the [rewritten Matchers documentation](matchers.md#top) for details\r\n  * Catch2 currently provides _some_ generic matchers, but there should be more before final release of v3\r\n    * `IsEmpty`, `SizeIs` which check that the range has specific properties\r\n    * `Contains`, which checks whether a range contains a specific element\r\n    * `AllMatch`, `AnyMatch`, `NoneMatch` range matchers, which apply matchers over a range of elements\r\n* Significant compilation time improvements\r\n  * including `catch_test_macros.hpp` is 80% cheaper than including `catch.hpp`\r\n* Some runtime performance optimizations\r\n  * In all tested cases the v3 branch was faster, so the table below shows the speedup of v3 to v2 at the same task\r\n<a id=\"v3-runtime-optimization-table\"></a>\r\n\r\n|                   task

the `-o` flag (#2061, #2163)\r\n* `Approx::operator()` is now properly `const`\r\n* Catch2's internal helper variables no longer use reserved identifiers (#578)\r\n* `--rng-seed` now accepts string `\"random-device\"` to generate random seed using `std::random_device`\r\n* Catch2 now supports test sharding (#2257)\r\n  * You can ask for the tests to be split into N groups and only run one of them.\r\n  * This greatly simplifies parallelization of tests in a binary through external runner.\r\n* The embedded CLI parser now supports repeatedly callable lambdas\r\n  * A lambda-based option parser can opt into being repeatedly specifiable.\r\n* Added `STATIC_CHECK` macro, similar to `STATIC_REQUIRE` (#2318)\r\n  * When deferred tu runtime, it behaves like `CHECK`, and not like `REQUIRE`.\r\n* You can have multiple tests with the same name, as long as other parts of the test identity differ (#1915, #1999, #2175)\r\n  * Test identity includes test's name, test's tags and and test's class name if applicable.\r\n* Added new warning, `UnmatchedTestSpec`, to error on test specs with no matching tests\r\n* The `-w`, `--warn` warning flags can now be provided multiple times to enable multiple warnings\r\n* The case-insensitive handling of tags is now more reliable and takes up less memory\r\n* Test case and assertion counting can no longer reasonably overflow on 32 bit systems\r\n  * The count is now kept in `uint64_t` on all platforms, instead of using `size_t` type.\r\n* The `-o`, `--out` output destination specifiers recognize `-` as stdout\r\n  * You have to provide it as `--out=-` to avoid CLI error about missing option\r\n  * The new reporter specification also recognizes `-` as stdout\r\n* Multiple reporters can now run at the same time and write to different files (#1712, #2183)\r\n  * To support this, the `-r`, `--reporter` flag now also accepts optional output destination\r\n  * For full overview of the semantics of using multiple reporters, look into the reporter documentation\r\n  * To enable the new syntax, reporter names can no longer contain `::`.\r\n* Console colour support has been rewritten and significantly improved\r\n  * The colour implementation based on ANSI colour codes is always available\r\n  * Colour implementations respect their associated stream\r\n    * previously e.g. Win32 impl would change console colour even if Catch2 was writing to a file\r\n  * The colour API is resilient against changing evaluation order of expressions\r\n  * The associated CLI flag and compile-time configuration options have changed\r\n    * For details see the docs for command-line and compile-time Catch2 configuration\r\n* Added a support for Bazel integration with `XML_OUTPUT_FILE` env var (#2399)\r\n  * This has to be enabled during compilation.\r\n* Added `--skip-benchmarks` flag to run tests without any `BENCHMARK`s (#2392, #2408)\r\n* Added option to list all listeners in the binary via `--list-listeners`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* The `INFO` macro no longer contains superfluous semicolon (#1456)\r\n* The `--list*` family of command line flags now return 0 on success (#1410, #1146)\r\n* Various ways of failing a benchmark are now counted and reporter properly\r\n* The ULP matcher now handles comparing numbers with different signs properly (#2152)\r\n* Universal ADL-found operators should no longer break decomposition (#2121)\r\n* Reporter selection is properly case-insensitive\r\n  * Previously it forced lower cased name, which would fail for reporters with upper case characters in name\r\n* The cumulative reporter base stores benchmark results alongside assertion results\r\n* Catch2's SE handling should no longer interferes with ASan on Windows (#2334)\r\n* Fixed Windows console colour handling for tests that redirect stdout (#2345)\r\n* Fixed issue with the `random` generators returning the same value over and over again\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_MATCHERS` no longer exists.\r\n  * If you do not want to use Matchers in a TU, do not include their header.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_CHRONO_STRINGMAKER` no longer exists.\r\n  * `StringMaker` specializations for `<chrono>` are always provided\r\n* Catch2's CMake now provides 2 targets, `Catch2` and `Catch2WithMain`.\r\n  * `Catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `Catch2WithMain` also links in the default main\r\n* Catch2's pkg-config integration also provides 2 packages\r\n  * `catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `catch2-with-main` also links in the default main\r\n* Passing invalid test specifications passed to Catch2 are now reported before tests are run, and are a hard error.\r\n* Running 0 tests (e.g. due to empty binary, or test spec not matching anything) returns non-0 exit code\r\n  * Flag `--allow-running-no-tests` overrides this behaviour.\r\n  * `NoTests` warning has been removed because it is fully subsumed by this change.\r\n* Catch2's compile-time configuration options (`CATCH_CONFIG_FOO`) can be set through CMake options of the same name\r\n  * They use the same semantics as C++ defines, including the `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_FOO` overrides,\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_DEFAULT_REPORTER=compact` changes default reporter to \"compact\"\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_ANDROID_LOGWRITE=ON` forces android logwrite to off\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_ANDROID_LOGWRITE=OFF` does nothing (the define will not exist)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/67120792/reactions","total_count":36,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":22,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":9,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64896367","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64896367/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64896367/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v3.0.0-preview5","id":64896367,"author":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABA2rM4D3j1v","tag_name":"v3.0.0-preview5","target_commitish":"devel","name":"v3.0.0-preview5","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2022-04-20T21:46:44Z","updated_at":"2022-04-23T21:17:58Z","published_at":"2022-04-20T21:59:20Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/63150133","id":63150133,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dw5g1","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"text/plain","state":"uploaded","size":362562,"digest":null,"download_count":89,"created_at":"2022-04-20T21:53:04Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T21:53:06Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.0.0-preview5/catch_amalgamated.cpp"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/63150136","id":63150136,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dw5g4","name":"catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":833,"digest":null,"download_count":20,"created_at":"2022-04-20T21:53:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T21:53:07Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.0.0-preview5/catch_amalgamated.cpp.asc"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/63150135","id":63150135,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dw5g3","name":"catch_amalgamated.hpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/hore

is intended to be the last preview before full release. All API-breaking changes should be accounted for.**\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n**Catch2 now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model.\r\nThis also means that to get all of Catch2's functionality in a test file,\r\nyou have to include multiple headers.**\r\n\r\nYou probably want to look into the [migration docs](docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top),\r\nwhich were written to help people coming from v2.x.x versions to the\r\nv3 releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n* Why is Catch2 moving to separate headers?\r\n  * The short answer is future extensibility and scalability. The long answer is complex and can be found on my blog, but at the most basic level, it is that providing single-header distribution is at odds with providing variety of useful features. When Catch2 was distributed in a single header, adding a new Matcher would cause overhead for everyone, but was useful only to a subset of users. This meant that the barrier to entry for new Matchers/Generators/etc is high in single header model, but much smaller in the new model.\r\n* Will Catch2 again distribute single-header version in the future?\r\n  * No. But we do provide sqlite-style amalgamated distribution option. This means that you can download just 1 .cpp file and 1 header and place them next to your own sources. However, doing this has downsides similar to using the `catch_all.hpp` header.\r\n* Why the big breaking change caused by replacing `catch.hpp` with `catch_all.hpp`?\r\n  * The convenience header `catch_all.hpp` exists for two reasons. One of them is to provide a way for quick migration from Catch2, the second one is to provide a simple way to test things with Catch2. Using it for migration has one drawback in that it is **big**. This means that including it _will_ cause significant compile time drag, and so using it to migrate should be a conscious decision by the user, not something they can just stumble into unknowingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### (Potentially) Breaking changes\r\n* **Catch2 now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model**\r\n  * **Including `catch.hpp` no longer works**\r\n* **Catch2 now uses C++14 as the minimum support language version**\r\n* `ANON_TEST_CASE` has been removed, use `TEST_CASE` with no arguments instead (#1220)\r\n* `--list*` commands no longer have non-zero return code (#1410)\r\n* `--list-test-names-only` has been removed (#1190)\r\n  * You should use verbosity-modifiers for `--list-tests` instead\r\n* `--list*` commands are now piped through the reporters\r\n  * The top-level reporter interface provides default implementation that works just as the old one\r\n  * XmlReporter outputs a machine-parseable XML\r\n* `TEST_CASE` description support has been removed\r\n  * If the second argument has text outside tags, the text will be ignored.\r\n* Hidden test cases are no longer included just because they don't match an exclusion tag\r\n  * Previously, a `TEST_CASE(\"A\", \"[.foo]\")` would be included by asking for `~[bar]`.\r\n* `PredicateMatcher` is no longer type erased.\r\n  * This means that the type of the provided predicate is part of the `PredicateMatcher`'s type\r\n* `SectionInfo` no longer contains section description as a member (#1319)\r\n  * You can still write `SECTION(\"ShortName\", \"Long and wordy description\")`, but the description is thrown away\r\n  * The description type now must be a `const char*` or be implicitly convertible to it\r\n* The `[!hide]` tag has been removed.\r\n  * Use `[.]` or `[.foo]` instead.\r\n* Lvalues of composed matchers cannot be composed further\r\n* Uses of `REGISTER_TEST_CASE` macro need to be followed by a semicolon\r\n  * This does not change `TEST_CASE` and friends in any way\r\n* `IStreamingReporter::IsMulti` member function was removed\r\n  * This is _very_ unlikely to actually affect anyone, as it was default-implemented in the interface, and only used internally\r\n* Various classes not designed for user-extension have been made final\r\n  * `ListeningReporter` is now `final`\r\n  * Concrete Matchers (e.g. `UnorderedEquals` vector matcher) are now `final`\r\n  * All Generators are now `final`\r\n* Matcher namespacing has been redone\r\n  * Matcher types are no longer in deeply nested namespaces\r\n  * Matcher factory functions are no longer brought into `Catch` namespace\r\n  * This means that all public-facing matcher-related functionality is now in `Catch::Matchers` namespace\r\n* Defining `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` will no longer create main in that TU.\r\n  * Link with `libCatch2Main.a`, or the proper CMake/pkg-config target\r\n  * If you want to write custom main, include `catch2/catch_session.hpp`\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES` has been removed.\r\n  * You should instead include the appropriate headers as needed.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_IMPL` has been removed.\r\n  * The implementation is now compiled into a static library.\r\n* Event Listener interface has changed\r\n  * `TestEventListenerBase` was renamed to `EventListenerBase`\r\n  * `EventListenerBase` now directly derives from `IStreamingReporter`, instead of deriving from `StreamingReporterBase`\r\n* `GENERATE` decays its arguments (#2012, #2040)\r\n  * This means that `str` in `auto str = GENERATE(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\");` is inferred to `char const*` rather than `const char[2]`.\r\n* `--list-*` flags write their output to file specified by the `-o` flag\r\n* Many changes to reporter interfaces\r\n  * With the exception of the XmlReporter, the outputs of first party reporters should remain the same\r\n  * New pair of events were added\r\n  * One obsolete event was removed\r\n  * The base class has been renamed\r\n  * The built-in reporter class hierarchy has been redone\r\n* Catch2 generates a random seed if one hasn't been specified by the user\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tests`, `-l`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tags`, `-t`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n* The `--colour` option has been replaced with `--colour-mode` option\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Matchers have been extended with the ability to use different signatures of `match` (#1307, #1553, #1554, #1843)\r\n  * This includes having templated `match` member function\r\n  * See the [rewritten Matchers documentation](matchers.md#top) for details\r\n  * Catch2 currently provides _some_ generic matchers, but there should be more before final release of v3\r\n    * `IsEmpty`, `SizeIs` which check that the range has specific properties\r\n    * `Contains`, which checks whether a range contains a specific element\r\n    * `AllMatch`, `AnyMatch`, `NoneMatch` range matchers, which apply matchers over a range of elements\r\n* Significant compilation time improvements\r\n  * including `catch_test_macros.hpp` is 80% cheaper than including `catch.hpp`\r\n* Some runtime performance optimizations\r\n  * In all tested cases the v3 branch was faster, so the table below shows the speedup of v3 to v2 at the same task\r\n<a id=\"v3-runtime-optimization-table\"></a>\r\n\r\n|                   task

the `-o` flag (#2061, #2163)\r\n* `Approx::operator()` is now properly `const`\r\n* Catch2's internal helper variables no longer use reserved identifiers (#578)\r\n* `--rng-seed` now accepts string `\"random-device\"` to generate random seed using `std::random_device`\r\n* Catch2 now supports test sharding (#2257)\r\n  * You can ask for the tests to be split into N groups and only run one of them.\r\n  * This greatly simplifies parallelization of tests in a binary through external runner.\r\n* The embedded CLI parser now supports repeatedly callable lambdas\r\n  * A lambda-based option parser can opt into being repeatedly specifiable.\r\n* Added `STATIC_CHECK` macro, similar to `STATIC_REQUIRE` (#2318)\r\n  * When deferred tu runtime, it behaves like `CHECK`, and not like `REQUIRE`.\r\n* You can have multiple tests with the same name, as long as other parts of the test identity differ (#1915, #1999, #2175)\r\n  * Test identity includes test's name, test's tags and and test's class name if applicable.\r\n* Added new warning, `UnmatchedTestSpec`, to error on test specs with no matching tests\r\n* The `-w`, `--warn` warning flags can now be provided multiple times to enable multiple warnings\r\n* The case-insensitive handling of tags is now more reliable and takes up less memory\r\n* Test case and assertion counting can no longer reasonably overflow on 32 bit systems\r\n  * The count is now kept in `uint64_t` on all platforms, instead of using `size_t` type.\r\n* The `-o`, `--out` output destination specifiers recognize `-` as stdout\r\n  * You have to provide it as `--out=-` to avoid CLI error about missing option\r\n  * The new reporter specification also recognizes `-` as stdout\r\n* Multiple reporters can now run at the same time and write to different files (#1712, #2183)\r\n  * To support this, the `-r`, `--reporter` flag now also accepts optional output destination\r\n  * For full overview of the semantics of using multiple reporters, look into the reporter documentation\r\n  * To enable the new syntax, reporter names can no longer contain `::`.\r\n* Console colour support has been rewritten and significantly improved\r\n  * The colour implementation based on ANSI colour codes is always available\r\n  * Colour implementations respect their associated stream\r\n    * previously e.g. Win32 impl would change console colour even if Catch2 was writing to a file\r\n  * The colour API is resilient against changing evaluation order of expressions\r\n  * The associated CLI flag and compile-time configuration options have changed\r\n    * For details see the docs for command-line and compile-time Catch2 configuration\r\n* Added a support for Bazel integration with `XML_OUTPUT_FILE` env var (#2399)\r\n  * This has to be enabled during compilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* The `INFO` macro no longer contains superfluous semicolon (#1456)\r\n* The `--list*` family of command line flags now return 0 on success (#1410, #1146)\r\n* Various ways of failing a benchmark are now counted and reporter properly\r\n* The ULP matcher now handles comparing numbers with different signs properly (#2152)\r\n* Universal ADL-found operators should no longer break decomposition (#2121)\r\n* Reporter selection is properly case-insensitive\r\n  * Previously it forced lower cased name, which would fail for reporters with upper case characters in name\r\n* The cumulative reporter base stores benchmark results alongside assertion results\r\n* Catch2's SE handling should no longer interferes with ASan on Windows (#2334)\r\n* Fixed Windows console colour handling for tests that redirect stdout (#2345)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_MATCHERS` no longer exists.\r\n  * If you do not want to use Matchers in a TU, do not include their header.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_CHRONO_STRINGMAKER` no longer exists.\r\n  * `StringMaker` specializations for `<chrono>` are always provided\r\n* Catch2's CMake now provides 2 targets, `Catch2` and `Catch2WithMain`.\r\n  * `Catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `Catch2WithMain` also links in the default main\r\n* Catch2's pkg-config integration also provides 2 packages\r\n  * `catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `catch2-with-main` also links in the default main\r\n* Passing invalid test specifications passed to Catch2 are now reported before tests are run, and are a hard error.\r\n* Running 0 tests (e.g. due to empty binary, or test spec not matching anything) returns non-0 exit code\r\n  * Flag `--allow-running-no-tests` overrides this behaviour.\r\n  * `NoTests` warning has been removed because it is fully subsumed by this change.\r\n* Catch2's compile-time configuration options (`CATCH_CONFIG_FOO`) can be set through CMake options of the same name\r\n  * They use the same semantics as C++ defines, including the `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_FOO` overrides,\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_DEFAULT_REPORTER=compact` changes default reporter to \"compact\"\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_ANDROID_LOGWRITE=ON` forces android logwrite to off\r\n    * `-DCATCH_CONFIG_ANDROID_LOGWRITE=OFF` does nothing (the define will not exist)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64896367/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":6,"eyes":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64291745","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64291745/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/64291745/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v2.13.9","id":64291745,"author":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABA2rM4D1QOh","tag_name":"v2.13.9","target_commitish":"devel","name":"v2.13.9","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-04-12T20:38:28Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T20:40:05Z","published_at":"2022-04-12T20:40:05Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/62378478","id":62378478,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dt9Hu","name":"catch.hpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"text/plain","state":"uploaded","size":657276,"digest":null,"download_count":411539,"created_at":"2022-04-12T20:39:57Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T20:39:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v2.13.9/catch.hpp"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/62378482","id":62378482,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dt9Hy","name":"catch.hpp.asc","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":833,"digest":null,"download_count":103,"created_at":"2022-04-12T20:39:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T20:40:00Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v2.13.9/catch.hpp.asc"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/releases/assets/62378484","id":62378484,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABA2rM4Dt9H0","name":"catch_reporter_automake.hpp","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","foll

now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model.\r\nThis also means that to get all of Catch2's functionality in a test file,\r\nyou have to include multiple headers.**\r\n\r\nFor quick'n'dirty migration, you can replace the old `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>`\r\nwith `#include <catch2/catch_all.hpp>`. This is a (one of) convenience\r\nheader(s) that brings in _all_ of headers in Catch2. By doing this,\r\nyou should be able to migrate instantly, but at the cost of (significantly)\r\nincreased compilation times. You should prefer piecemeal including\r\nheaders that are actually required by your test code.\r\n\r\nThe basic set of functionality (`TEST_CASE`, `SECTION`, `REQUIRE`) is in\r\n`catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp`. Matchers are in `matchers` subfolder,\r\ngenerators in `generators` subfolder, and so on.\r\n\r\nNote that while most documentation has been updated to the new design,\r\nit is still a work in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n* Why is Catch2 moving to separate headers?\r\n  * The short answer is future extensibility and scalability. The long answer is complex and can be found on my blog, but at the most basic level, it is that providing single-header distribution is at odds with providing variety of useful features. When Catch2 was distributed in a single header, adding a new Matcher would cause overhead for everyone, but was useful only to a subset of users. This meant that the barrier to entry for new Matchers/Generators/etc is high in single header model, but much smaller in the new model.\r\n* Will Catch2 again distribute single-header version in the future?\r\n  * No. But we do provide sqlite-style amalgamated distribution option. This means that you can download just 1 .cpp file and 1 header and place them next to your own sources. However, doing this has downsides similar to using the `catch_all.hpp` header.\r\n* Why the big breaking change caused by replacing `catch.hpp` with `catch_all.hpp`?\r\n  * The convenience header `catch_all.hpp` exists for two reasons. One of them is to provide a way for quick migration from Catch2, the second one is to provide a simple way to test things with Catch2. Using it for migration has one drawback in that it is **big**. This means that including it _will_ cause significant compile time drag, and so using it to migrate should be a conscious decision by the user, not something they can just stumble into unknowingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### (Potentially) Breaking changes\r\n* **Catch2 now uses statically compiled library as its distribution model**\r\n  * **Including `catch.hpp` no longer works**\r\n* **Catch2 now uses C++14 as the minimum support language version**\r\n* `ANON_TEST_CASE` has been removed, use `TEST_CASE` with no arguments instead (#1220)\r\n* `--list*` commands no longer have non-zero return code (#1410)\r\n* `--list-test-names-only` has been removed (#1190)\r\n  * You should use verbosity-modifiers for `--list-tests` instead\r\n* `--list*` commands are now piped through the reporters\r\n  * The top-level reporter interface provides default implementation that works just as the old one\r\n  * XmlReporter outputs a machine-parseable XML\r\n* `TEST_CASE` description support has been removed\r\n  * If the second argument has text outside tags, the text will be ignored.\r\n* Hidden test cases are no longer included just because they don't match an exclusion tag\r\n  * Previously, a `TEST_CASE(\"A\", \"[.foo]\")` would be included by asking for `~[bar]`.\r\n* `PredicateMatcher` is no longer type erased.\r\n  * This means that the type of the provided predicate is part of the `PredicateMatcher`'s type\r\n* `SectionInfo` no longer contains section description as a member (#1319)\r\n  * You can still write `SECTION(\"ShortName\", \"Long and wordy description\")`, but the description is thrown away\r\n  * The description type now must be a `const char*` or be implicitly convertible to it\r\n* The `[!hide]` tag has been removed.\r\n  * Use `[.]` or `[.foo]` instead.\r\n* Lvalues of composed matchers cannot be composed further\r\n* Uses of `REGISTER_TEST_CASE` macro need to be followed by a semicolon\r\n  * This does not change `TEST_CASE` and friends in any way\r\n* `IStreamingReporter::IsMulti` member function was removed\r\n  * This is _very_ unlikely to actually affect anyone, as it was default-implemented in the interface, and only used internally\r\n* Various classes not designed for user-extension have been made final\r\n  * `ListeningReporter` is now `final`\r\n  * Concrete Matchers (e.g. `UnorderedEquals` vector matcher) are now `final`\r\n  * All Generators are now `final`\r\n* Matcher namespacing has been redone\r\n  * Matcher types are no longer in deeply nested namespaces\r\n  * Matcher factory functions are no longer brought into `Catch` namespace\r\n  * This means that all public-facing matcher-related functionality is now in `Catch::Matchers` namespace\r\n* Defining `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` will no longer create main in that TU.\r\n  * Link with `libCatch2Main.a`, or the proper CMake/pkg-config target\r\n  * If you want to write custom main, include `catch2/catch_session.hpp`\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES` has been removed.\r\n  * You should instead include the appropriate headers as needed.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_IMPL` has been removed.\r\n  * The implementation is now compiled into a static library.\r\n* Event Listener interface has changed\r\n  * `TestEventListenerBase` was renamed to `EventListenerBase`\r\n  * `EventListenerBase` now directly derives from `IStreamingReporter`, instead of deriving from `StreamingReporterBase`\r\n* `GENERATE` decays its arguments (#2012, #2040)\r\n  * This means that `str` in `auto str = GENERATE(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\");` is inferred to `char const*` rather than `const char[2]`.\r\n* `--list-*` flags write their output to file specified by the `-o` flag\r\n* Many changes to reporter interfaces\r\n  * With the exception of the XmlReporter, the outputs of first party reporters should remain the same\r\n  * New pair of events were added\r\n  * One obsolete event was removed\r\n* Catch2 generates a random seed if one hasn't been specified by the user\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tests`, `-l`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n* The short flag for `--list-tags`, `-t`, has been removed.\r\n  * This is not a commonly used flag and does not need to use up valuable single-letter space.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Matchers have been extended with the ability to use different signatures of `match` (#1307, #1553, #1554, #1843)\r\n  * This includes having templated `match` member function\r\n  * See the [rewritten Matchers documentation](matchers.md#top) for details\r\n  * Catch2 currently provides _some_ generic matchers, but there should be more before final release of v3\r\n    * `IsEmpty`, `SizeIs` which check that the range has specific properties\r\n    * `Contains`, which checks whether a range contains a specific element\r\n    * `AllMatch`, `AnyMatch`, `NoneMatch` range matchers, which apply matchers over a range of elements\r\n* Significant compilation time improvements\r\n  * including `catch_test_macros.hpp` is 80% cheaper than including `catch.hpp`\r\n* Some runtime performance optimizations\r\n  * In all tested cases the v3 branch was faster, so the table below shows the speedup of v3 to v2 at the same task\r\n<a id=\"v3-runtime-optimization-table\"></a>\r\n\r\n|

file specified by the `-o` flag (#2061, #2163)\r\n* `Approx::operator()` is now properly `const`\r\n* Catch2's internal helper variables no longer use reserved identifiers (#578)\r\n* `--rng-seed` now accepts string `\"random-device\"` to generate random seed using `std::random_device`\r\n* Catch2 now supports test sharding (#2257)\r\n  * You can ask for the tests to be split into N groups and only run one of them.\r\n  * This greatly simplifies parallelization of tests in a binary through external runner.\r\n* The embedded CLI parser now supports repeatedly callable lambdas\r\n  * A lambda-based option parser can opt into being repeatedly specifiable.\r\n* Added `STATIC_CHECK` macro, similar to `STATIC_REQUIRE` (#2318)\r\n  * When deferred tu runtime, it behaves like `CHECK`, and not like `REQUIRE`.\r\n* You can have multiple tests with the same name, as long as other parts of the test identity differ (#1915, #1999, #2175)\r\n  * Test identity includes test's name, test's tags and and test's class name if applicable.\r\n* Added new warning, `UnmatchedTestSpec`, to error on test specs with no matching tests\r\n* The `-w`, `--warn` warning flags can now be provided multiple times to enable multiple warnings\r\n* The case-insensitive handling of tags is now more reliable and takes up less memory\r\n* Test case and assertion counting can no longer reasonably overflow on 32 bit systems\r\n  * The count is now kept in `uint64_t` on all platforms, instead of using `size_t` type.\r\n* The `-o`, `--out` output destination specifiers recognize `-` as stdout\r\n  * You have to provide it as `--out=-` to avoid CLI error about missing option\r\n  * The new reporter specification also recognizes `-` as stdout\r\n* Multiple reporters can now run at the same time and write to different files (#1712, #2183)\r\n  * To support this, the `-r`, `--reporter` flag now also accepts optional output destination\r\n  * For full overview of the semantics of using multiple reporters, look into the reporter documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* The `INFO` macro no longer contains superfluous semicolon (#1456)\r\n* The `--list*` family of command line flags now return 0 on success (#1410, #1146)\r\n* Various ways of failing a benchmark are now counted and reporter properly\r\n* The ULP matcher now handles comparing numbers with different signs properly (#2152)\r\n* Universal ADL-found operators should no longer break decomposition (#2121)\r\n* Reporter selection is properly case-insensitive\r\n  * Previously it forced lower cased name, which would fail for reporters with upper case characters in name\r\n* The cumulative reporter base stores benchmark results alongside assertion results\r\n* Catch2's SE handling should no longer interferes with ASan on Windows (#2334)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_MATCHERS` no longer exists.\r\n  * If you do not want to use Matchers in a TU, do not include their header.\r\n* `CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_CHRONO_STRINGMAKER` no longer exists.\r\n  * `StringMaker` specializations for `<chrono>` are always provided\r\n* Catch2's CMake now provides 2 targets, `Catch2` and `Catch2WithMain`.\r\n  * `Catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `Catch2WithMain` also links in the default main\r\n* Catch2's pkg-config integration also provides 2 packages\r\n  * `catch2` is the statically compiled implementation by itself\r\n  * `catch2-with-main` also links in the default main\r\n* Passing invalid test specifications passed to Catch2 are now
