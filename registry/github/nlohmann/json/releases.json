42f6e95cad6ec532fd372391373363b62a14af6d771056dbfc86160e6dfff7aa (json.tar.xz)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis release fixes some bugs found in the [3.11.3](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.3) release and adds some new features.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n## Key updates and enhancements\r\n\r\n- **Diagnostic byte positions**: A new macro, [`JSON_DIAGNOSTIC_POSITIONS`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/json_diagnostic_positions/), introduces member functions to query the **byte positions** of values in the input they were parsed from. When enabled, this information is also included in exceptions to help pinpoint errors. #4517 #4455 #4570 #4569 #4572 #4571 #4579 #4585 #4561\r\n- **Enhanced conversion macros**: The [**conversion macros for arbitrary types**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/arbitrary_types/#simplify-your-life-with-macros) now include several upgrades:\r\n    - All macros are **templated**, supporting `json`, [**`ordered_json`**](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/ordered_json/), and any other `basic_json` specialization. #4597 #2528 #4377 #2532 #2843 #3810 #4608\r\n    - **Derived classes** can now be seamlessly converted to/from JSON using the new `NLOHMANN_DEFINE_DERIVED_TYPE_*` macros. #4033 #2199 #4562\r\n- **Support for `std::optional`**: The library now supports conversions from/to `std::optional` types when compiled with C++17. #1749 #4036\r\n- **Flexible string compatibility**: Functions [`patch`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/patch/), [`diff`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/diff/), and [`flatten`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/flatten/) now work with arbitrary string types. #4536 #4134 #4613 #4019\r\n- **Binary format enhancements**:\r\n    - The [**BJData mapping**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/bjdata/) now supports draft 3, including optimized binary array types. #4513 #4588\r\n    - The [**BSON mapping**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/bson/) has added support for unsigned 64-bit integers. #4590 #4535 #3894\r\n    - The `get_number` function used in the binary format implementations has been optimized to read multiple bytes at once. #4391\r\n- **Multidimensional array conversion**: Multidimensional C-style arrays can now be directly converted to JSON. #4262 #4248\r\n- **Filesystem paths in UTF-8**: The conversions from/to `std::filesystem::path` are now encoded to UTF-8 strings by default on all operating systems. #4271 #4631\r\n- **CMake 4.0 support**. By adjusting the CMake minimal version to 3.5, CMake 4.0 can be used without warning or error. #4709\r\n\r\n## Changes and fixes\r\n\r\n- The [`iteration_proxy`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/items/) is now a **`std::forward_iterator`** instead of just an `std::input_iterator`. This allows more use cases when [`items()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/items/) is fed into C++20 `std::views`. The iterator always satisfied all requirements for a forward iterator, but was exposed as only an input iterator by the used iterator tag. #4371 #4372\r\n- Fix the conversion from enums with unsigned underlying type to JSON. #4236 #4237\r\n- Fix GDB pretty printer which was broken since `m_data` added. #4343 #4309\r\n- Update natvis to reflect 3.11.3 and the current structure of `basic_json`. #4451 #4438 #4438\r\n- Fix crash when passing `nullptr` to [`parse`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/parse/) function expecting `FILE*`. Instead, now an exception is thrown. #4485 #4487\r\n- Fix number parsing such that integers are not parsed to float when `EINTR` set in `errno`. #4506\r\n- Fix [SAX output of `number_float`](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/parsing/sax_interface/) to be locale-independent. #4505 #4084\r\n- Fix iterators to allow comparing default-initialized iterators. #4512 #4493\r\n- Fix return value of [`get_ptr`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/get_ptr/) for unsigned integers. #4525 #4475\r\n- Fix regression of #2755 and replace `EOF` with `char_traits`. #4532\r\n- Fix [extended diagnostics](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/#extended-diagnostic-messages) to not trigger an assertion. #4537 #3915\r\n- Fix [`NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE_WITH_DEFAULT`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/nlohmann_define_type_intrusive/) throw an exception with an empty json #4507 #4508\r\n- Modernize integer comparison. #4577 #4559\r\n- Serialize empty tuple into `[]` instead of `null`. #4594 #4530\r\n\r\n## Warnings\r\n\r\nThe [quality assurance](https://json.nlohmann.me/community/quality_assurance/) page gives an overview of the warning flags used during the tests.\r\n\r\n### Compiler warnings\r\n\r\n- Suppress `weak-vtables` warning for exceptions. #4500 #4087\r\n- Add 40+ GCC warning flags for

[3.11.2](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.2) release.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- Allow [**custom base class**](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/json_base_class_t/) as node customization point. This adds an additional template parameter which allows to set a custom base class for `nlohmann::json`. This class serves as an extension point and allows to add functionality to json node. Examples for such functionality might be metadata or additional member functions (e.g., visitors) or other application specific code. By default the parameter is set to `void` and an empty base class is used. In this case the library behaves as it already did. #3110\r\n- Add more specific parse error message when attempting to **parse empty input**. #4037 #4180\r\n- Add serialization-only user defined type [**macros**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/macros/) (`NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY_SERIALIZE` and `NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE_ONLY_SERIALIZE`). #3816\r\n- Add **Bazel** build support. If you are using [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) you can simply reference this repository using `http_archive` or `git_repository` and depend on `@nlohmann_json//:json`. #3709\r\n- Support Apple's Swift Package Manager. #4010\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Adjust CMake files to accept `NEW` **CMake policies** up to CMake 3.14.

See the [**migration guide**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/migration_guide/) for help adjusting your code for future versions.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- The function `iterator_wrapper` is deprecated. Please use the member function [`items()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/items/) instead.\r\n- Functions `friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)` and `friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)` are deprecated. Please use [`friend std::istream&  operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&)`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/operator_gtgt/) and [`friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&)`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/operator_ltlt/) instead.\r\n- Passing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n- The implicit conversion from JSON Pointers to string ([`json_pointer::operator string_t`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_string_t)) is deprecated. Use [`json_pointer::to_string`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/to_string/) instead.\r\n- Comparing JSON Pointers with strings via [`operator==`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_eq/) and [`operator!=`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_ne/) have been deprecated. To compare a [`json_pointer`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/) `p` with a string `s`, convert `s` to a `json_pointer` first and use [`json_pointer::operator==`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_eq/) or [`json_pointer::operator!=`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_ne/). #3684\r\n\r\nAll deprecations are annotated with [`HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR`](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/api-reference.html#HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR) to report which function to use instead.\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/4223","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/131808000/reactions","total_count":103,"+1":51,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":17,"confused":0,"heart":19,"rocket":13,"eyes":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/74294065","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/74294065/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/74294065/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.2","id":74294065,"author":{"login":"nlohmann","id":159488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAKp23M4EbaMx","tag_name":"v3.11.2","target_commitish":"develop","name":"JSON

[3.11.1](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.1) release. Furthermore, the []((https://json.nlohmann.me/features/namespace/)) of the namespace library has been re-structured.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix the [`value`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/value/) function which was broken for strings, size types, and `nullptr` in release 3.11.0. #3652 #3655 #3663\r\n- Fix the `json_fwd.hpp` header to be self-contained and add it to the single-header release. #3656 #3679 #3687\r\n- Fix regression that broke using [`json_pointer`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/) as key in associative containers. #3680 #3685\r\n- Add missing constraint to deprecated JSON Pointer overloads of [`contains`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/contains/) and [`at`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/at/). #3658 #3681 \r\n- Fix comparison between [`json_pointer`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/) and strings with `==` and `!=`. These comparisons worked in 3.10.5, but were broken in 3.11.0 and 3.11.1. #3654 #3664\r\n- Fix `to_json` conversion of `std::vector<bool>::reference` and `std::vector<bool>::const_reference` for STLs where these are the same as `basic_json::boolean_t&` and `basic_json::boolean_t`, respectively. #3677 #3678\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- Restructure inline namespace and allow version component to be disabled. See [documentation](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/namespace/). #3683 #3696 #3697 #3698\r\n- Avoid heap allocations in [BJData](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/bjdata/) parser. #3637\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Publish documentation on every push to `develop` branch. #3660 #3673\r\n- Add missing examples for the [public API](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/). #3672 #3686\r\n- Fix typo in [`json_pointer`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/) documentation. #3692\r\n\r\n#### Community\r\n\r\n- Add a badge for the [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/6mrGXKvX7y) to the README file. The goal of that additional communication channel beyond [the existing ones](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#support) is to quickly coordinate between the contributors. #3651\r\n- Complete contributor list. #3662 #3670\r\n\r\n#### CI\r\n\r\n- Remove the `macos-10.15` image from the CI as it is removed by GitHub Actions. #3612 #3615 #3626\r\n- Remove hardcoded paths in Ubuntu workflow. #3626\r\n- Only trigger AppVeyor builds if relevant files have been changed. #3626\r\n- Fix CodeQL warning. #3626\r\n- Harmonize naming of GitHub Actions jobs. #3661\r\n- Add labeler action to automatically add PR labels based on the changed files. #3671 #3674 #3675\r\n- Lint API documentation in the CI. #3672\r\n- Add local [LGTM](http://lgtm.com) configuration and suppress warnings on third-party scripts. #3643\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\n- This release deprecates comparing JSON Pointers with strings via [`operator==`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_eq/) and [`operator!=`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_ne/). To compare a [`json_pointer`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/) `p` with a string `s`, convert `s` to a `json_pointer` first and use [`json_pointer::operator==`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_eq/) or [`json_pointer::operator!=`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_ne/). #3684\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- The function `iterator_wrapper` is deprecated. Please use the member function [`items()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/items/) instead.\r\n- Functions `friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)` and `friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)` are deprecated. Please use [`friend std::istream&  operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&)`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/operator_gtgt/) and [`friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&)`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/operator_ltlt/) instead.\r\n- Passing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n- The implicit conversion from JSON Pointers to string ([`json_pointer::operator string_t`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/operator_string_t)) is deprecated. Use [`json_pointer::to_string`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/json_pointer/to_string/) instead.\r\n\r\nAll deprecations are annotated with [`HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR`](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/api-reference.html#HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR) to report which function to use instead.\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/3700","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/74294065/reactions","total_count":75,"+1":45,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":18,"rocket":4,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/73381517","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/73381517/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/73381517/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.1","id":73381517,"author":{"login":"nlohmann","id":159488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAKp23M4EX7aN","tag_name":"v3.11.1","target_commitish":"develop","name":"JSON

string literals (UDL) into namespace `nlohmann::literals::json_literals` (see [documentation](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/json_use_global_udls/)). Unfortunately, this namespace was not imported to the global namespace by default which broke code. This release fixes this bug.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.

sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Set default value of [`JSON_USE_GLOBAL_UDLS`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/json_use_global_udls/) and the CMake options `JSON_GlobalUDLs` to `1` to import the user-defined string literals from the

It brings:\r\n\r\n- **String view** support for all functions working on object keys (e.g., [`at`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/at/) or [`operator[]`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/operator%5B%5D/)), avoiding unnecessary allocations.\r\n- **BJData** as the fifth supported binary format besides BSON, CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON.\r\n- **Better C++20 support** to make the library integrate more smoothly with newer codebases.\r\n- Better support for avoiding problems when **multiple versions** of the library are used in the same project.\r\n- Even better and more extensive **documentation** and **examples**.\r\n- **More tests** for edge cases like 32-bit support, C++20 features, using the library with ICPC, or after including `<windows.h>`.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or

Summary\r\n\r\nThe previous version 3.10.4 introduced support to convert **`std::filesystem`** objects to JSON and vice versa. Unfortunately, we made the assumption that any compiler supporting C++17 would also have proper filesystem support. This was a mistake. This release introduces preprocessor checks  (and means to override them) to make sure that the conversion support is only compiled if the compiler is detected to support it.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Make sure C++17 filesystem conversions are only used if the compiler supports it. Furthermore, add defines  [`JSON_HAS_FILESYSTEM` and `JSON_HAS_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM`](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/macros/#json_has_cpp_11-json_has_cpp_14-json_has_cpp_17-json_has_cpp_20) which can be set to `0` to avoid using filesystem support altogether.`std::filesystem`. #3090 #3097 #3101 #3156 #3203\r\n- Fix a compilation error with Nvidia CUDA Compiler (NVCC).  #3013 #3234\r\n\r\n#### Warnings\r\n\r\n- Fix a warning for shadowed variables. #3188 #3193\r\n- Fix a warning on a pointless comparison. #3227 #2712 #2676 #1390 #755\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- Add a parameter to the [`update`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/update/) function to recursively merge objects with common keys. #3006 #3069\r\n- Extend [`std::hash`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/std_hash/#version-history) and [`std::swap`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/std_swap/) to work on any `nlohmann::basic_json` specializations rather than just `nlohmann::json`. #3121\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n#### Tests and CI\r\n\r\n- Update CI to use Clang 14, GCC 6, and Clang-Tidy 14. #3088\r\n- Update cpplint. #3225\r\n- Add build step for the Nvidia CUDA Compiler (NVCC). #3227\r\n- Remove Travis CI. #3087 #3233\r\n- Compile and execute the test suite with C++17. #3101\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n- The [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)-based documentation in [doc/mkdocs](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/doc/mkdocs) has been totally overworked. It now has a unified structure, more examples, and contains all information from the previous Doxygen-based documentation. The single source of truth is now the documentation on <https://json.nlohmann.me> and in particular the [**API Documentation**](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/). #3071\r\n- Removed Wandbox online examples. #3071\r\n- Fix typos, links, and parameter names in the documentation. #3102 #3125 #3140 #3145 #3148\r\n- Add more examples. #3071 #3100\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated.

date: 2021-10-16\r\nSHA-256: c9ac7589260f36ea7016d4d51a6c95809803298c7caec9f55830a0214c5f9140 (json.hpp), 62c585468054e2d8e7c2759c0d990fd339d13be988577699366fe195162d16cb (include.zip)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis release fixes two bugs introduced in release 3.10.0 and fixes the conversion of `std::filesystem::path`. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix regression bug introduced in release 3.10.0 which broke compilation for types with an explicit default constructor with default arguments. #3077 #3079\r\n- Fix regression bug introduced in release 3.10.0 which treated the return values of `std::find` and `std::remove` as pointers which could break compilation. #3081 #3082\r\n- Fix converting `std::filesystem::path` to JSON. Before release 3.10.3, such a conversion would trigger a stack overflow. Release 3.10.3 then further broke compilation on Windows. #3070 #3073\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated. Please use the member function [`items()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5961446010dfc494e0c247b4e9026977.html#a5961446010dfc494e0c247b4e9026977) instead.\r\n- Functions [`friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a60ca396028b8d9714c6e10efbf475af6.html#a60ca396028b8d9714c6e10efbf475af6) and [`friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a34d6a60dd99e9f33b8273a1c8db5669b.html#a34d6a60dd99e9f33b8273a1c8db5669b) are deprecated. Please use [`friend std::istream&  operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8.html#aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8) and [`friend operator<<(std::ostream&,

annotated with [`HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR`](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/api-reference.html#HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR) to report which function to use instead.\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/3083","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/51473298/reactions","total_count":54,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":9,"hooray":11,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":6,"eyes":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/51030085","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/51030085/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/51030085/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.10.3","id":51030085,"author":{"login":"nlohmann","id":159488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAKp23M4DCqhF","tag_name":"v3.10.3","target_commitish":"develop","name":"JSON

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release fixes two more bug introduced in release 3.10.0: the **extended diagnostics triggered assertions** when used with `update()` or when inserting elements into arrays. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix bug in the [`update()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/update/) function when used with extended diagnostics. #3007 #3008\r\n- Fix bug when inserting into arrays when using extended diagnostics. #2926 #3032 #3037\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n#### Binary formats\r\n\r\n- Custom allocators are now supported when writing binary formats (e.g., CBOR, MessagePack) into a `std::vector`. #2982 #2989\r\n\r\n#### User-defined type support\r\n\r\n- Allow conversion from types that do not define an explicit iterator type, but have a `begin()` and `end()` function. #3020\r\n\r\n#### Tests and CI\r\n\r\n- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/nlohmann/json-ci) used in the CI. #2981 #2986\r\n- Corrected the compiler version mentioned in the README file. #3040\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Add script to generate docset for Dash, Velocity, and Zeal. #2967\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated. Please use the member function [`items()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5961446010dfc494e0c247b4e9026977.html#a5961446010dfc494e0c247b4e9026977) instead.\r\n- Functions [`friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a60ca396028b8d9714c6e10efbf475af6.html#a60ca396028b8d9714c6e10efbf475af6) and [`friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a34d6a60dd99e9f33b8273a1c8db5669b.html#a34d6a60dd99e9f33b8273a1c8db5669b) are deprecated. Please use [`friend std::istream&  operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&)`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8.html#aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8) and [`friend operator<<(std::ostream&,

annotated with [`HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR`](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/api-reference.html#HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR) to report which function to use instead.\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/3065","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/51030085/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":9,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/48475874","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/48475874/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/48475874/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.10.2","id":48475874,"author":{"login":"nlohmann","id":159488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ4NDc1ODc0","tag_name":"v3.10.2","target_commitish":"develop","name":"JSON

Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release fixes a bug introduced in release 3.10.0: the **extended diagnostics triggered an assertion** when used with `ordered_json`. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix an assertion triggered in the extended diagnostics using `ordered_json`. #2962 #2963 \r\n- Make GDB pretty-printer robust against unset variable names. #2950\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n#### Warnings\r\n\r\n- Add a missing header to `hash.hpp`. #2948\r\n- Fix some `-Wextra-semi-stmt` warnings. #2957\r\n\r\n#### Tests and CI\r\n\r\n- Avoid duplicate builds in AppVeyor. #2952\r\n- Remove an outdated test binary that is not supported any longer. #2941 #2945\r\n- Skip tests that would fail if CMake option `JSON_Install` is set to `OFF`. #2946 #2947\r\n- Move Travis jobs to travis-ci.com. #2938 #2959\r\n- Set stack size for some unit tests when building with MSVC. #2955 #2961\r\n- Add a regression test. #2960\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Update the Homebrew command as [nlohmann-json](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nlohmann-json) is now in homebrew-core. #2943 #2966\r\n- Add example for integration via vcpkg. #2944 #2954\r\n- Fix a typo in the documentation. #2968\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nJSON for Modern C++ 3.10.0 is the first release for over a year. It contains some new features and a lot of minor changes and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nMost notably, it introduces [**extended diagnostics.**](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/#extended-diagnostic-messages) By defining [`JSON_DIAGNOSTICS`](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/macros/#json_diagnostics) before including the `json.hpp`, a [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) is added to [exceptions](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/) which helps to debug issues with object access, array indices, or mismatching types.\r\n\r\nAnother important change behind the curtains is a **fully overworked CI** which performs a lot of checks for every commit which should allow more frequent releases in the future.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- Add **extended diagnostics information** by adding a [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) to the [exception](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/) messages indicating the exact location of a invalid type errors or out-of-bound errors.\r\n    \r\n\t```\r\n\t[json.exception.type_error.302] (/address/housenumber) type must be number, but is string\r\n\t```\r\n    \r\n\tExceptions in the library are thrown in the local context of the JSON value they are detected. This makes detailed diagnostics messages, and hence debugging, difficult. To create better diagnostics messages, each JSON value needs a pointer to its parent value such that a global context (i.e., a path from the root value to the value that lead to the exception) can be created. That global context is then provided as a JSON Pointer.\r\n    \r\n\tAs this global context comes at the price of storing one additional pointer per JSON value and runtime overhead to maintain the parent relation, extended diagnostics are disabled by default. They can, however, be enabled by defining the preprocessor symbol [`JSON_DIAGNOSTICS`](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/macros/#json_diagnostics) to 1 before including `json.hpp`. See the [`documentation`](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/#extended-diagnostic-messages) for more information. #932 #1508 #2562 #2838 #2866\r\n- Add a [**GDB pretty printer**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/third_party/gdb_pretty_printer) to facilitate reading `basic_json` values in GDB. #1952 #2607\r\n- Add a new value `store` to the [cbor_tag_handler_t](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/cbor_tag_handler_t/) which allows to store the tags of CBOR values as binary subtypes. #2863 #2908\r\n- Add support for containers with non-default-constructible types. #2574 #2576\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix a regression bug that failed `ordered_json` to be used when exceptions were switched off. #2347 #2725 #2934\r\n- Added iterator range insertion for `ordered_json`. #2490 #2512\r\n- Change the type of binary subtypes to `std::uint64_t` to support subtypes >255. Furthermore, the return value of the `subtype()` function has been fixed to the documented value `-1` in case no subtype is given. #2863 #2908\r\n- Fix move constructor of internal `json_ref` type which created `null` values when compiled with `-fno-elide-constructors`. #2387 #2405\r\n- Fix the compilation of `input_adapter` for containers in edge cases. #2553\r\n- Allow parsing from `std::byte` containers. #2413 #2546 #2550 #2602 #2869\r\n- Fix memory leak in `to_json` in case a JSON value is reused. #2865 #2872\r\n- Fix compilation error in case symbol `EOF` was not found. #2755 #2756\r\n- Fix Compilation error when using `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM` with `ordered_json` on libc++. #2491 #2825\r\n\r\n#### Warnings\r\n\r\nA lot of warnings have been fixed in this release. To make sure the library remains warning-free, the CI now breaks in case a warning is found in GCC (261 warning flags), Clang (flag `-Weverything` with 8 exceptions), or MSVC (flag `/W4`).\r\n\r\n- Fix `-Wimplicit-fallthrough` warnings. #2348 #2349\r\n- Fix `-Wfloat-equal` warnings. #2909 #2911\r\n- Add assertions to suppress C28020 warnings. #2447\r\n- Fix shadow warnings. #1759 #2536 #2444\r\n- Fix compiler warnings in the test suite. #2537\r\n- Fix issues found by Visual Studio Visual Assist #2615\r\n- Fix unused parameter warning. #2646 #2658 #2668 #2706 #2707\r\n- Remove HEDLEY annotation from `exception::what()` to fix C28204 warning. #2673 #2680\r\n- Suppress C4127 warning. #2592 #2875\r\n- Fix truncation warning. #2572 #2874\r\n- Fix useless cast warning. #1777 #2114 #2893 #2902\r\n- Fix unknown pragma warning. #2924 #2925\r\n- Fix `-Wswitch-enum` warnings. #2927\r\n- Fix C4309 and C4100 warnings and treat all MSVC `/W4` warnings as error. #2930\r\n- Suppress fewer warning flags. #2936\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n#### Tests and CI\r\n\r\nThe CI chain has been completely overworked and now runs mostly on a dedicated [Docker Image](https://github.com/nlohmann/json-ci) that contains all relevant tools.\r\n\r\n- Collected all CI calls in a [CMake file](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/cmake/ci.cmake) which can be enabled by setting `JSON_CI`.\r\n- Linux now builds with Clang 3.5 to 12 and GCC 4.8 to 11 checking multiple C++ standards. #2540\r\n- Windows builds with MSVC 2015 to 2019, MinGW (GCC 8), Clang 11 and 12, and Clang-CL 11 checking multiple C++ standards.\r\n- Mac builds with Xcode 10.2.1 to Xcode 12.4 checking multiple C++ standards. #1798 #2561 #2737 #2790 #2817\r\n- Use static analysis tools Clang-Tidy, Cppcheck, Valgrind, Google Sanitizers, Clang Static Analyzer, Cpplint, and Facebook Infer.\r\n- Add internal checks for CMake flags, switched off exceptions, header amalgamation, self-contained headers, and exclusion of certain tests via CTest.\r\n- Providers: Move most Travis/AppVeyor builds to GitHub Actions. Use [Drone CI](https://cloud.drone.io/nlohmann/json) for aarch64 build. Remove FOSSA. Properly select \"Release\" build for Travis CI builds. #2375 #2689\r\n- Remove `#define private public` hack from test files. Instead, macro `JSON_PRIVATE_UNLESS_TESTED` is used in the source code which defaults to `private`, but can be set to `public` to test internals. #43 #913 #1985 #2352\r\n\r\n#### CMake\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue in CMake file that overwrote `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` when the test suite was compiled. #2344 #2384\r\n- Only enable CMake options `JSON_BuildTests` and `JSON_Install` by default when the library is the main project. #2513 #2514\r\n- Add CTest label `not_reproducible` to skip non-reproducible tests. #2324 #2560\r\n- Formatted CMake files ##2770\r\n- Add a CMake option `JSON_SystemInclude` to use `SYSTEM` in `target_include_directories`. #2762\r\n- Add CMake option `JSON_FastTests` (`OFF` by default) to which slow test suite.\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Fixed typos in the documentation. #2354 #2754\r\n- Extended documentation for discarded values and `is_discarded()` function. #2360 #2363\r\n- Fix Markdown of README. #2582\r\n- Fix example in README file. #2625 #2659\r\n- Fix example in parse exceptions documentation. #2679\r\n- Overworked [documentation of number handling](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/types/number_handling/). #2747\r\n- Add link to Conan Center package to README. #2771\r\n- Added example for CPM.cmake. #2406\r\n- Update README to use HTTPS everywhere. #2789\r\n- Fixed consistency of `using` declarations in README. #2826\r\n- Fix documentation of tests that required a Git checkout. #2845\r\n- Fix code samples in GIF slideshow. #2457\r\n- Update documentation to reference [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html) as JSON standard.\r\n- Add section on how to get support to README file.\r\n- Replaced links to Doxygen documentation with new [API documentation](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/).\r\n- Documented the effect of a [bug](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/2114) in Microsoft's STL that makes `what()` member function of exception objects unusable in case `_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` is set. #2824\r\n\r\n#### Thirdparty\r\n\r\n- Updated Hedley to version 15. #2367\r\n- Updated Doctest to version 2.4.6. #2525 #2538 #2686 #2687\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- Use C++14 constructs where available. #2533\r\n- Fix `pkg-config.pc` generation. #2690\r\n- Add possibility to set the C++ standard via macros `JSON_HAS_CPP_11`, `JSON_HAS_CPP_14`, `JSON_HAS_CPP_17`, and `JSON_HAS_CPP_20`. By defining any of these symbols, the internal check is overridden and the provided C++ version is unconditionally assumed. This can be helpful for compilers that only implement parts of the standard and would be detected incorrectly. #2730 #2731 #2749\r\n- Add preprocessor symbol `JSON_NO_IO`. When defined, headers `<cstdio>`, `<ios>`, `<iosfwd>`, `<istream>`, and `<ostream>` are not included and parse functions relying on these headers are excluded. This is relevant for environment where these I/O functions are disallowed for security reasons (e.g., Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)). #2728 #2729 #2842 #2861\r\n- Benchmarks are handled via `FetchContent` and require CMake version 3.11. Removed Google Benchmark copy. Fix default branch name for Google Benchmarks. #2795 #2796\r\n- Simplify object parser for CBOR. #2879 #2598\r\n- Cleaned up maintainer Makefiles\r\n\r\n#### Licensing\r\n\r\n- Clarified license of `is_complete_type` implementation. #2534\r\n- License fix for `integer_sequence` and `index_sequence` implementation. #2683\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated.

Modern C++ 3.9.0 is a feature release that adds four long-awaited features, some requested five years ago.\r\n\r\n- The parser functions have now an option to ignore `//` and `/* */` style **comments**. Though comments are not officially part of the JSON specification (see [here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#comments-in-json) for a discussion), comment support was a frequently requested feature, and its implementation was much less effort than continuously explaining the lack of comment support.\r\n- The second-most requested feature was a way to **preserve the insertion order of object keys**. Though this was possible via template specialization for a while, we now added a new type `nlohmann::ordered_json` as drop-in replacement for `nlohmann::json` for this.\r\n- To circumvent unexpected behavior, **implicit conversions** can now be switched off with a CMake or preprocessor option.\r\n- Last, but not least, a mapping between user-defined types and JSON can now be expressed using **convenience macros** by just listing the names of the member variables to read/write.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible. See below the complete list of changes. See the [README](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/README.md) or the [documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/) for more information.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- Add optional support for [**comments in JSON**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#comments-in-json): passing parameter `ignore_comments` to the `parse` function will treat `//` and `/* */` comments like whitespace. #294 #363 #376 #597 #1513 #2061 #2212\r\n- Add type `nlohmann::ordered_json` to [**preserve insertion order of object keys**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#order-of-object-keys). `ordered_json` is a specialization of `basic_json` and can be used wherever `json` is used. #106 #424 #543 #660 #727 #952 #1106 #1717 #1817 #2179 #2206 #2258\r\n- Add CMake option `JSON_ImplicitConversions` and preprocessor symbol `JSON_USE_IMPLICIT_CONVERSIONS` to [**switch off implicit conversions**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#implicit-conversions). Implicit conversions, though very practical, are also a source of subtle bugs or unexpected behavior and may be switched off by default in future versions. The new options allow to remove implicit conversions now. #958 #1559\r\n- Add [**convenience macros** `NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE` and `NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#simplify-your-life-with-macros) to simplify serialization/deserialization code for user-defined types. #2175 #2225 #2233 #2267 #2280 #2287 #2306 #2313\r\n- Add **high-precision number support for UBJSON**. Now, any JSON value can serialized to UBJSON, and exception `json.exception.out_of_range.407` will no longer occur for integers larger than 9223372036854775807 (`LLONG_MAX`). #2297 #2286\r\n- Write **binary subtype as CBOR tag**. #2244\r\n- Add option to **ignore CBOR tags** as alternative to treat them as invalid input. #2308 #2273 #1968\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix bug in CBOR parser where `allow_exceptions` was not respected. #2299 #2298\r\n- Fix bug in CBOR parser where incomplete binary values or strings could crash the parser. #2293 #2294\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- Make code compile with **Clang on Windows**. #2259 #1119\r\n- Use 32-bit float encoding in MessagePack wherever this is possible without loss of precision. #2201 #2196\r\n- Replace `std::hash<nlohmann::basic_json>` with a function that does not allocate memory. #2292 #2285 #2269\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- Use [GitLab Discussions](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions) for support and feature requests. Removed and adjusted issue templates accordingly.\r\n- Allow CMake 3.13+ to override options when using `FetchContent`. #2222\r\n- Add support for [pkg-config](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#pkg-config). #2253\r\n- Add CMake option `JSON_TestDataDirectory` to select directory of previously downloaded test data for situations where Internet access is forbidden during testing. #2189 #2190\r\n- Add [option to skip tests](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#execute-unit-tests) that assume the code is checked out via Git. #2189\r\n- Add `JSON_ASSERT` macro to control behavior of assert calls. #2242\r\n- Add CI step for [GitHub CodeQL analysis](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Code+scanning+-+action%22) (GitHub actions).\r\n- Add CI step for Clang 9 and Clang 10 on Windows (GitHub actions). #2259\r\n- Add CI step for Clang 10 CL with MSVC 2019 on Windows (GitHub actions). #2268\r\n- Clean up GitHub actions CI. #2300\r\n- Add CI step for Xcode 12 (Travis). #2262\r\n- Add CI step for explicit conversions (Travis, AppVeyor).\r\n- Remove `swap` specialization to support C++20. #2176\r\n- Add missing check for `binary()` function in [SAX interface](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#sax-interface). #2282\r\n- Add [test](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/test/cmake_target_include_directories/project) for CMake `target_include_directories`. #2279\r\n- Add test to use library in multiple translation units. #2301\r\n- Add more sections to new [project website](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/). #2312\r\n- Fix warnings. #2304 #2305 #2303 #2274 #2224 #2211 #2203\r\n- Cleanup maintainer Makefiles. #2264 #2274\r\n- Improve documentation. #2232\r\n- Fix inconsistency in int-to-string function. #2193\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nPassing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists is deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nIt has been six months since the last release, and a lot of minor changes and bug fixes have accumulated. Nonetheless, JSON for Modern C++ 3.8.0 is a feature release.\r\n\r\n- With **binary values** we greatly extend the support for binary formats such as CBOR, BSON, or MessagePack. By adding a new value type to the JSON class, binary values can be read and written, and even shared between different formats. See [the documentation](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#binary-formats-bson-cbor-messagepack-and-ubjson) for examples.\r\n\r\n- Furthermore, we overworked the **input adapters**; that is, the way input is read by the parsers. Now any container is supported via the `LegacyInputIterator` concept. See [the documentation](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#custom-data-source) for examples. At the same time, we could improve the performance by 3-10%.\r\n\r\nAll changes are backward-compatible. See below the complete list of changes.\r\n\r\n:moneybag: Note you can now **support this project** via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/nlohmann).\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- The library now supports binary values for CBOR (byte arrays), BSON, and MessagePack (bin, ext, fixext). The values are parsed into a byte vector for further processing. #483 #757 #1129 #1509 #1662 #1668 #2064 #2069 #2071 #2082 #2099\r\n- The input adapters have been generalized to read from any container including user-defined containers via `LegacyInputIterator`. The encoding of the input is implicitly derived from the size of the value type: UTF-8 (1 byte), UTF-16 (2 bytes), and UTF-32 (4 bytes) are supported. #1813 #2145 #2174 #2178\r\n- CBOR now encodes floating-point numbers that can be represented by a `float` as `float` to save space in the serialization (32 bit va. 64 bit). #1719 #2044\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- The functions to parse binary formats (`from_bson`, `from_cbor`, `from_msgpack`, and `from_ubjson`) now properly respect the `allow_exceptions=false` parameter. #1715 #2140\r\n- The `contains` function for JSON Pointers now returns `false` in all cases a syntactically correct JSON Pointer refers to a non-existing value. Previously, an exception was raised if a JSON Pointer referred to an array, but did not consist of a number. #1942 #1982 #2019\r\n- Fixed the JSON Pointer parser which accepted numbers with leading `+` as array index. #1990\r\n- Fixed JSON Patch generation to properly use `/-` in the `add` operation for arrays. #1983 #2054\r\n- Fixed compilation errors using GCC 10. #1912 #1920 #2034\r\n- Fixed compilation errors using MSVC 2019. #1695 #1810 #1958 #2006 #2008 #2009\r\n- Fixed a preprocessor check for some MSVC versions. #2112 #2137\r\n- Fixed possible memory leak in `push_back`. #1971 #2025\r\n- Removed broken overload of the `value()` function with `json::value_t type` parameter. #2086 #2104\r\n- Removed values from arrays in case they are discarded by a parser callback function. Such values remained in the array with type `discarded` before. #1972 #2153\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- The input adapters are now used via templates rather than inheriting from an abstract base class. This brings a 3-10% speedup for all parsers. #1457 #1950\r\n- Test files are now downloaded from an [external repository](https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data) such that the code repository got much smaller and can be used as submodule more easily. #96 #482 #556 #567 #620 #732 #1066 #1184 #1185 #1235 #1497 #1572 #1790 #2081\r\n- Made CMake's version config file architecture-independent. #1697 #1746\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- Added links to [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann) and listed named sponsors.\r\n- Documented the integration of the library via CMake [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/FetchContent.html) #2073 #2074\r\n- Doozer CI was removed as it seems to exist no longer. #2080\r\n- Added GitHub Actions workflows to build with Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.\r\n- Added GCC 10.1 to the continuous integration. #2136\r\n- Fixed the Coveralls integration. #2100\r\n- Fixed the error message for invalid surrogate pairs. #2076\r\n- Fixed documentation. #1853 #1857 #1895 #1903 #1907 #1915 #1917 #1918 #1923 #1956 #1979 #1980 #2002 #2060 #2077 #2142 #2143 #2152\r\n- Added test cases for NaN value in CBOR. #2043\r\n- Documented curious behavior when using the library with glibc. #1924 #1933\r\n- Fixed compiler warnings. #1939 #1911 #1967 #1969 #2049 #2051 #2053 #2113 #2116 #2144 #2177\r\n- Updated Doctest to version 2.3.7. #2048 #2050\r\n- Updated Hedley to version 13.\r\n- Removed `std::is_pod` usage as it is deprecated in C++20. #1913 #2033 #2109\r\n- Added [wsjcpp](https://wsjcpp.org) package manager. #2004\r\n- Added [Build2](https://build2.org/) package manager. #1909\r\n- Fixed compiler warning in test case. #1871\r\n- Updated copyright year. #2010\r\n- Updated CMake tests. #1844\r\n- Removed a duplicated test. #2158\r\n- Removed outdated Travis macOS images for Xcode 8.3, Xcode 9.0, Xcode 9.1, and Xcode 9.2. Added Xcode 11.2 image.\r\n- Added [FOSSA](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fnlohmann%2Fjson?ref=badge_shield) analysis.\r\n- Header `<ciso646>` is deprecated in C++17 and not included if library is compiled with C++17. #2089 .#2115\r\n- Updated the templates for bug fix reports, feature requests, and questions.\r\n- Added fuzz tests for the all UBJSON modes. #2182\r\n- Used [`HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR`](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/api-reference.html#HEDLEY_DEPRECATED_FOR) to indicate deprecated functions to have supporting compilers report which function to use instead.\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release deprecates passing iterator pairs or pointer/length pairs to parsing functions (`basic_json::parse`, `basic_json::accept`, `basic_json::sax_parse`, `basic_json::from_cbor`, `basic_json::from_msgpack`, `basic_json::from_ubjson`, `basic_json::from_bson`) via initializer lists. Instead, pass two iterators; for instance, call `basic_json::from_cbor(ptr, ptr+len)` instead of `basic_json::from_cbor({ptr, len})`.\r\n\r\nThe following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/doxygen/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976.html#a0a8051760196ac813fd5eb3c8d5a2976) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nProject [bad_json_parsers](https://github.com/lovasoa/bad_json_parsers) tested how JSON parser libraries react on **deeply nested inputs**. It turns out that this library segfaulted at a certain nesting depth. This bug was fixed with this release. **Now the parsing is only bounded by the available memory.** All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that lead to stack overflow for deeply nested JSON values (objects, array) by changing the implementation of the destructor from a recursive to an iterative approach. #832, #1419, #1835\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n* Added WhiteStone Bolt. #1830\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions.

All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- Add overload of the **[`contains`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_ab23b04802eb9da97dc3f664e54e09cb3.html#ab23b04802eb9da97dc3f664e54e09cb3) function** to check if a JSON pointer is valid without throwing exceptions, just like its [counterpart for object keys](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a9286acdc0578fc66e9346323e69fc0e3.html#a9286acdc0578fc66e9346323e69fc0e3). #1600\r\n- Add a function **[`to_string`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/namespacenlohmann_a6ce645a0b8717757e096a5b5773b7a16.html#a6ce645a0b8717757e096a5b5773b7a16)** to allow for generic conversion to strings. #916 #1585\r\n- Add **return value for the [`emplace_back`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_abf29131f898b05aad2c01a9c80e7a002.html#abf29131f898b05aad2c01a9c80e7a002) function**, returning a reference to the added element just like C++17 is [introducing this](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back) for `std::vector`. #1609\r\n- Add info how to use the library with the **[pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) package manager** on MSYS2. #1670\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix an issue where typedefs with certain names yielded a compilation error. #1642 #1643\r\n- Fix a conversion to `std::string_view` in the unit tests. #1634 #1639\r\n- Fix MSVC Debug build. #1536 #1570 #1608\r\n- Fix [`get_to`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a65753c68f06639eda0d355f919564e01.html#a65753c68f06639eda0d355f919564e01) method to clear existing content before writing. #1511 #1555\r\n- Fix a `-Wc++17-extensions` warning. `nodiscard` attributes are now only used with Clang when `-std=c++17` is used. #1535 #1551\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- Switch from [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) to **[doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)** for the unit tests which speeds up compilation and runtime of the 112,112,308 tests.\r\n- Add an explicit section to the [README](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/README.md) about the **frequently addressed topics** [character encoding](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#character-encoding), [comments in JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#comments-in-json), and the [order of object keys](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#order-of-object-keys).\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- Use [`GNUInstallDirs`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/GNUInstallDirs.html) to set library install directories. #1673\r\n- Fix links in the [README](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/README.md). #1620 #1621 #1622 #1623 #1625\r\n- Mention [`json` type](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/namespacenlohmann_a2bfd99e845a2e5cd90aeaf1b1431f474.html#a2bfd99e845a2e5cd90aeaf1b1431f474) on the [documentation start page](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/index.html). #1616\r\n- Complete documentation of [`value()` function](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_adcf8ca5079f5db993820bf50036bf45d.html#adcf8ca5079f5db993820bf50036bf45d) with respect to `type_error.302` exception. #1601\r\n- Fix links in the documentation. #1598\r\n- Add regression tests for MSVC. #1543 #1570\r\n- Use **[CircleCI](http://circleci.com)** for [continuous integration](https://circleci.com/gh/nlohmann/json).\r\n- Use **[Doozer](https://doozer.io)** for [continuous integration](https://doozer.io/nlohmann/json) on Linux (CentOS, Raspbian, Fedora)\r\n- Add tests to check each CMake flag (`JSON_BuildTests`, `JSON_Install`, `JSON_MultipleHeaders`, `JSON_Sanitizer`, `JSON_Valgrind`, `JSON_NoExceptions`, `JSON_Coverage`).\r\n- Use [Hedley](https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/) to avoid re-inventing several compiler-agnostic feature macros like `JSON_DEPRECATED`, `JSON_NODISCARD`, `JSON_LIKELY`, `JSON_UNLIKELY`, `JSON_HAS_CPP_14`, or `JSON_HAS_CPP_17`. Functions taking or returning pointers are annotated accordingly when a pointer will not be null.\r\n- Build and run tests on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nlohmann/json) in DEBUG and RELEASE mode.\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e.html#af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release introduces three new features:\r\n\r\n- **BSON (Binary JSON)** is next to CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON the fourth binary (de)serialization format supported by the library.\r\n- **Adjustable error handlers for invalid Unicode** allows to specify the behavior when invalid byte sequences are serialized.\r\n- **Simplified enum/JSON mapping** with a macro in case the default mapping to integers is not desired.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some effort has been invested in improving the **parse error messages**. Besides, a few bugs have been fixed. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- The library can read and write a subset of **[BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) (Binary JSON)**. All data types known from JSON are supported, whereas other types more tied to MongoDB such as timestamps, object ids, or binary data are currently not implemented. See [the README](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#binary-formats-bson-cbor-messagepack-and-ubjson) for examples. #1244 #1320\r\n- The behavior when the library encounters an invalid Unicode sequence during serialization can now be controlled by defining one of three **Unicode error handlers**: (1) throw an exception (default behavior), (2) replace invalid sequences by the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD), or (3) ignore/filter invalid sequences. See the [documentation of the `dump` function](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5) for examples. #1198 #1314\r\n- To easily specify a user-defined **enum/JSON mapping**, a macro `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM` has been introduced. See the [README section](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#specializing-enum-conversion) for more information. #1208 #1323\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- fixed truncation #1286 #1315\r\n- fixed an issue with std::pair #1299 #1301\r\n- fixed an issue with std::variant #1292 #1294\r\n- fixed a bug in the JSON Pointer parser\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- The **diagnosis messages for parse errors** have been improved: error messages now indicated line/column positions where possible (in addition to a byte count) and also the context in which the error occurred (e.g., \"while parsing a JSON string\"). Example: error `parse error at 2: syntax error - invalid string: control character must be escaped; last read: '<U+0009>'` is now reported as `parse error at line 1, column 2: syntax error while parsing value - invalid string: control character U+0009 (HT) must be escaped to \\u0009 or \\t; last read: '<U+0009>'`. #1280 #1288 #1303\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- improved Meson documentation #1305\r\n- fixed some more linter warnings #1280\r\n- fixed Clang detection for third-party Google Benchmark library #1277\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions.

date: 2018-10-05\r\nSHA-256: f1327bb60c58757a3dd2b0c9c45d49503d571337681d950ec621f8374bcc14d4 (json.hpp), 9588d63557333aaa485e92221ec38014a85a6134e7486fe3441e0541a5a89576 (include.zip)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for **GCC 4.8**. Furthermore, it adds a function [**`get_to`**](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a8a3db7d78f74232d3a6fb8f1abf69709.html#a8a3db7d78f74232d3a6fb8f1abf69709) to write a JSON value to a passed reference. Another topic of this release was the **CMake support** which has been overworked and documented.\r\n\r\nBesides, a lot of bugs have been fixed and slight improvements have been made. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- The library can now also built with **GCC 4.8**. Though this compiler does not fully support C++11, it can successfully compile and run the test suite. Note that bug [57824](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57824) in GCC 4.8 still forbids to use multiline raw strings in arguments to macros. #1257\r\n- Added new function [**`get_to`**](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a8a3db7d78f74232d3a6fb8f1abf69709.html#a8a3db7d78f74232d3a6fb8f1abf69709) to write a JSON value to a passed reference. The destination type is automatically derived which allows more succinct code compared to the `get` function. #1227 #1231\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug in the CMake file that made `target_link_libraries` to not properly include `nlohmann_json`. #1243 #1245 #1260\r\n- Fixed a warning in MSVC 2017 complaining about a constexpr if. #1204 #1268 #1272\r\n- Fixed a bug that prevented compilation with ICPC. #755 #1222\r\n- Improved the SFINAE correctness to fix a bug in the conversion operator. #1237 #1238\r\n- Fixed a `-Wctor-dtor-privacy` warning. #1224\r\n- Fixed a warning on a lambda in unevaluated context. #1225 #1230\r\n- Fixed a bug introduced in version 3.2.0 where defining `JSON_CATCH_USER` led to duplicate macro definition of `JSON_INTERNAL_CATCH`. #1213 #1214\r\n- Fixed a bug that prevented compilation with Clang 3.4.2 in RHEL 7. #1179 #1249\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- Added [documentation on CMake integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#cmake) of the library. #1270\r\n- Changed the CMake file to use `find_package(nlohmann_json)` without installing the library. #1202\r\n- Improved error messages in case `operator[]` is used with the wrong combination (json.exception.type_error.305) of JSON container type and argument type. Example: \"cannot use operator[] with a string argument\". #1220 #1221\r\n- Added a license and version information to the Meson build file. #1252\r\n- Removed static assertions to indicated missing `to_json` or `from_json` functions as such assertions do not play well with SFINAE. These assertions also led to problems with GMock. #960 #1212 #1228\r\n- The test suite now does not wait forever if run in a wrong directory and input files are not found. #1262\r\n- The test suite does not show deprecation warnings for deprecated functions which frequently led to confusion. #1271\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- GCC 4.8 and Xcode 10 were added to the [continuous integration suite](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) at Travis.\r\n- Added [lgtm](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/nlohmann/json/context:cpp) checks to pull requests.\r\n- Added tests for CMake integration. #1260\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e.html#af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a [**SAX interface**](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/structnlohmann_1_1json__sax.html) to the library. While this may be a very special feature used by only few people, it allowed to unify all functions that consumed input and created some kind of JSON value. Internally, now all existing functions like `parse`, `accept`, `from_cbor`, `from_msgpack`, and `from_ubjson` use the SAX interface with different event processors. This allowed to separate the input processing from the value generation. Furthermore, throwing an exception in case of a parse error is now optional and up to the event processor. Finally, the JSON parser is now non-recursive (meaning it does not use the call stack, but `std::vector<bool>` to track the hierarchy of structured values) which allows to process nested input more efficiently.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the library finally is able to parse from **wide string types**. This is the first step toward opening the library from UTF-8 to UTF-16 and UTF-32.\r\n\r\nThis release further fixes several bugs in the library. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New Features\r\n\r\n- added a parser with a **SAX interface** (#971, #1153)\r\n- support to parse from **wide string types** `std::wstring`, `std::u16string`, and `std::u32string`; the input will be converted to UTF-8 (#1031)\r\n- added support for **`std::string_view`** when using C++17 (#1028)\r\n- allow to **roundtrip `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`** from JSON if key type is not convertible to string; in these cases, values are serialized to arrays of pairs (#1079, #1089, #1133, #1138)\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- allow to create `nullptr_t` from JSON allowing to properly roundtrip `null` values (#1169)\r\n- allow compare user-defined string types (#1130)\r\n- better support for algorithms using iterators from `items()` (#1045, #1134)\r\n- added parameter to avoid compilation error with MSVC 2015 debug builds (#1114)\r\n- re-added accidentially skipped unit tests (#1176)\r\n- fixed MSVC issue with `std::swap` (#1168)\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- `key()` function for iterators returns a const reference rather than a string copy (#1098)\r\n- binary formats CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON now supports `float` as type for floating-point numbers (#1021)\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- changed issue templates\r\n- improved continuous integration: added builders for Xcode 9.3 and 9.4, added builders for GCC 8 and Clang 6, added builder for MinGW, added builders for MSVC targeting x86\r\n- required CMake version is now at least 3.8 (#1040)\r\n- overworked CMake file wrt. packaging (#1048)\r\n- added package managers: Spack (#1041) and CocoaPods (#1148)\r\n- fixed Meson include directory (#1142)\r\n- preprocessor macro `JSON_SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER_CHECK` can skip the rejection of unsupported compilers - use at your own risk! (#1128)\r\n- preprocessor macro `JSON_INTERNAL_CATCH`/`JSON_INTERNAL_CATCH_USER` allows to control the behavior of exception handling inside the library (#1187)\r\n- added note on `char` to JSON conversion\r\n- added note how to send security-related issue via encrypted email\r\n- removed dependency to `std::stringstream` (#1117)\r\n- added SPDX-License-Identifier\r\n- added updated JSON Parsing Test Suite, described in [Parsing JSON is a Minefield 💣](http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php)\r\n- updated to Catch 1.12.0\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e.html#af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release fixes several bugs in the library. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :bug: Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed parsing of **CBOR strings with indefinite length** (#961). Earlier versions of this library misinterpreted the CBOR standard and rejected input with the `0x7F` start byte.\r\n- Fixed user-defined **conversion to vector type** (#924, #969). A wrong SFINAE check rejected code though a user-defined conversion was provided.\r\n- Fixed documentation of the parser behavior for **objects with duplicate keys** (#963). The exact behavior is not specified by [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) and the library now also provides no guarantee which object key is stored.\r\n- Added check to detect memory **overflow when parsing UBJSON containers** (#962). The optimized UBJSON format allowed for specifying an array with billions of `null` elements with a few bytes and the library did not check whether this size exceeded `max_size()`.\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further Changes\r\n\r\n- [Code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) is now calculated for the individual header files, allowing to find uncovered lines more quickly than by browsing through the single header version (#953, #957).\r\n- A Makefile target `run_benchmarks` was added to quickly build and run the benchmark suite.\r\n- The documentation was harmonized with respect to the header inclusion (#955). Now all examples and the README use `#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>` to allow for selecting `single_include` or `include` or whatever installation folder as include directory.\r\n- Added note on how to use the library with the [cget](http://cget.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package manager (#954).\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e.html#af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e) are deprecated.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for the [**UBJSON**](http://ubjson.org) format and [**JSON Merge Patch**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386). It also contains some minor changes and bug fixes. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New features\r\n\r\n- The library now supports [**UBJSON**](http://ubjson.org) (Universal Binary JSON Specification) as binary format to read and write JSON values space-efficiently. See the [documentation overview](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/doc/binary_formats.md) for a comparison of the different formats CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON.\r\n- [**JSON Merge Patch**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) (RFC 7386) offers an intuitive means to describe patches between JSON values (#876, #877). See the documentation of [`merge_patch`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a0ec0cd19cce42ae6071f3cc6870ea295.html#a0ec0cd19cce42ae6071f3cc6870ea295) for more information.\r\n\r\n### :zap: Improvements\r\n\r\n- The library now uses the **Grisu2 algorithm** for printing floating-point numbers (based on the reference implementation by Florian Loitsch) which produces a short representation which is guaranteed to round-trip (#360, #935, #936).\r\n- The **UTF-8 handling** was further simplified by using the decoder of Björn Hoehrmann in more scenarios.\r\n\r\n### :truck: Reorganization\r\n\r\n- Though the library is released as a single header, its development got more and more complicated. With this release, the header is **split into several files** and the single-header file `json.hpp` can be generated from these development sources. In the repository, folder `include` contains the development sources and `single_include` contains the single `json.hpp` header (#700, #906, #907, #910, #911, #915, #920, #924, #925, #928, #944).\r\n- The split further allowed for a **forward declaration header** `include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp` to speed up compilation times (#314).\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further changes\r\n\r\n- [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) is now used for micro benchmarks (see `benchmarks` folder, #921).\r\n- The serialization (JSON and binary formats) now properly work with the libraries string template parameter, allowing for optimized string implementations to be used in constraint environments such as embedded software (#941, #950).\r\n- The exceptional behavior can now be overridden by defining macros `JSON_THROW_USER`, `JSON_TRY_USER`, and `JSON_CATCH_USER`, defining the behavior of `throw`, `try` and `catch`, respectively. This allows to switch off C++'s exception mechanism yet still execute user-defined code in case an error condition occurs (#938).\r\n- To facilitate the interplay with [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) and [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/), the library does not use the variable name `yytext` any more as it could clash with macro definitions (#933).\r\n- The library now defines `NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MAJOR`, `NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MINOR`, and `NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_PATCH` to allow for conditional compilation based on the included library version (#943, #948).\r\n- A compilation error with ICC has been fixed (#947).\r\n- Typos and links in the documentation have been fixed (#900, #930).\r\n- A compiler error related to incomplete types has been fixed (#919).\r\n- The tests form the [UTF-8 decoder stress test](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt) have been added to the test suite.\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\n- Function [`iterator_wrapper`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e.html#af1592a06bc63811886ade4f9d965045e) has been deprecated (#874). Since its introduction, the name was up for discussion, as it was too technical. We now introduced the member function [`items()`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_afe3e137ace692efa08590d8df40f58dd.html#afe3e137ace692efa08590d8df40f58dd) with the same semantics. `iterator_wrapper` will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the following functions are deprecated since version 3.0.0 and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- [`friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_ab7285a92514fcdbe6de505ebaba92ea3.html#ab7285a92514fcdbe6de505ebaba92ea3)\r\n- [`friend std::ostream& operator>>(const

**JSON Patch**. All changes are backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- :bug: The **\"copy\" operation of JSON Patch** ([RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)) requests that it is an error if the target path points into a non-existing array or object (see #894 for a detailed description). This release fixes the implementation to detect such invalid target paths and throw an exception.\r\n- :bug: An **array index in a JSON Pointer** ([RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)) must be an integer. This release fixes the implementation to throw an exception in case invalid array indices such as `10e2` are used.\r\n- :white_check_mark: Added the [JSON Patch tests](https://github.com/json-patch/json-patch-tests) from Byron Ruth and Mike McCabe.\r\n- :memo: Fixed the documentation of the [`at(ptr)` function with JSON Pointers](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a8ab61397c10f18b305520da7073b2b45.html#a8ab61397c10f18b305520da7073b2b45) to list all possible exceptions (see #888).\r\n- :memo: Updated the [container overview documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/) (see #883).\r\n- :wrench: The CMake files now respect the [`BUILD_TESTING`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html?highlight=build_testing) option (see #846, #885)\r\n- :rotating_light: Fixed some compiler warnings (see #858, #882).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated functions\r\n\r\n:fire: To unify the interfaces and to improve similarity with the STL, the following functions are deprecated since version 3.0.0 and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- [`friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&,

date: 2017-12-17\r\nSHA-256: 076d4a0cb890a3c3d389c68421a11c3d77c64bd788e85d50f1b77ed252f2a462\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/159488/34072418-8f5ba396-e287-11e7-9de7-8bc7482ac23c.png\" align=\"right\">\r\n\r\nAfter almost a year, here is finally a new release of JSON for Modern C++, and it is a major one! As we adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), this means the release includes some breaking changes, so please read the next section carefully before you update. But don't worry, we also added a few new features and put a lot of effort into fixing a lot of bugs and straighten out a few inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n### :boom: Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThis section describes changes that change the public API of the library and may require changes in code using a previous version of the library. In section \"Moving from 2.x.x to 3.0.0\" at the end of the release notes, we describe in detail how existing code needs to be changed.\r\n\r\n- The library now uses [**user-defined exceptions**](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a9a0aced019cb1d65bb49703406c84970.html#a9a0aced019cb1d65bb49703406c84970) instead of re-using those defined in `<stdexcept>` (#244). This not only allows to add more information to the exceptions (every exception now has an identifier, and parse errors contain the position of the error), but also to easily catch all library exceptions with a single `catch(json::exception)`.\r\n- When strings with a different encoding as UTF-8 were stored in JSON values, their serialization could not be parsed by the library itself, as only UTF-8 is supported. To enforce this library limitation and improve consistency, **non-UTF-8 encoded strings now yield a `json::type_error` exception during serialization** (#838). The check for valid UTF-8 is realized with code from [Björn Hoehrmann](http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/).\r\n- **NaN and infinity values can now be stored inside the JSON value** without throwing an exception. They are, however, still serialized as `null` (#388).\r\n- The library's iterator tag was changed from RandomAccessIterator to **[BidirectionalIterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BidirectionalIterator)** (#593). Supporting RandomAccessIterator was incorrect as it assumed an ordering of values in a JSON objects which are unordered by definition.\r\n- The library does not include the standard headers `<iostream>`, `<ctype>`, and `<stdexcept>` any more. You may need to add these headers to code relying on them.\r\n- Removed constructor `explicit basic_json(std::istream& i, const parser_callback_t cb = nullptr)` which was deprecated in version 2.0.0 (#480).\r\n\r\n### :fire: Deprecated functions\r\n\r\nTo unify the interfaces and to improve similarity with the STL, the following functions are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):\r\n\r\n- [`friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_ab7285a92514fcdbe6de505ebaba92ea3.html#ab7285a92514fcdbe6de505ebaba92ea3)\r\n- [`friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a9e06deabe69262c3ffc5533d32856983.html#a9e06deabe69262c3ffc5533d32856983)\r\n\r\nPlease use [`friend std::istream&  operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&)`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8.html#aaf363408931d76472ded14017e59c9e8) and [`friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&)`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5e34c5435e557d0bf666bd7311211405.html#a5e34c5435e557d0bf666bd7311211405) instead.\r\n\r\n### :sparkles: New features\r\n\r\nWith all this breaking and deprecation out of the way, let's talk about features!\r\n\r\n- We improved the **diagnostic information for syntax errors** (#301). Now, an exception [`json::parse_error`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1efc2468e6022be6e35fc2944cabe4d.html#af1efc2468e6022be6e35fc2944cabe4d) is thrown which contains a detailed message on the error, but also a member `byte` to indicate the byte offset in the input where the error occurred.\r\n- We added a **non-throwing syntax check** (#458): The new `accept` function returns a Boolean indicating whether the input is proper JSON. We also added a Boolean parameter `allow_exceptions` to the existing [`parse`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aa9676414f2e36383c4b181fe856aa3c0.html#aa9676414f2e36383c4b181fe856aa3c0) functions to return a `discarded` value in case a syntax error occurs instead of throwing an exception.\r\n- An [`update`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a1cfa9ae5e7c2434cab4cfe69bffffe11.html#a1cfa9ae5e7c2434cab4cfe69bffffe11) function was added to **merge two JSON objects** (#428). In case you are wondering: the name was inspired by [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.update).\r\n- The [`insert`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a1b0a4e60d56f1fe80501ed941e122892.html#a1b0a4e60d56f1fe80501ed941e122892) function now also supports an iterator range to add elements to an object.\r\n- The binary exchange formats **CBOR and MessagePack can now be parsed from input streams and written to output streams** (#477).\r\n- Input streams are now only read until the end of a JSON value instead of the end of the input (#367).\r\n- The serialization function [`dump`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5adea76fedba9898d404fef8598aa663.html#a5adea76fedba9898d404fef8598aa663) now has two optional parameters `ensure_ascii` to **escape all non-ASCII characters** with `\\uxxxx` and an `indent_char` parameter to choose whether to **indent with spaces or tabs** (#654). \r\n- Added **built-in type support** for C arrays (#502), `std::pair` and `std::tuple` (#563, #614), `enum` and `enum class` (#545), `std::vector<bool>` (#494). Fixed support for `std::valarray` (#702), `std::array` (#553), and `std::map<std::string, std::string>` (#600, #607).\r\n\r\n### :hammer: Further changes\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there have been a lot of changes under the hood:\r\n\r\n- Replaced the [re2c](http://re2c.org) generated scanner by a self-coded version which allows for a better modularization of the parser and better diagnostics. To test the new scanner, we added millions (8,860,608 to be exact) of unit tests to check all valid and invalid byte sequences of the Unicode standard.\r\n- Google's OSS-Fuzz is still constantly fuzz-testing the library and found several issues that were fixed in this release (#497, #504, #514, #516, #518, #519, #575).\r\n- We now also ignore UTF-8 byte order marks when parsing from an iterator range (#602).\r\n- Values can be now moved from initializer lists (#663).\r\n- Updated to [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) 1.9.7. Unfortunately, Catch2 currently has some performance issues.\r\n- The non-exceptional paths of the library are now annotated with `__builtin_expect` to optimize branch prediction as long as no error occurs.\r\n- MSVC now produces a stack trace in MSVC if a `from_json` or `to_json` function was not found for a user-defined type. We also added a debug visualizer [`nlohmann_json.natvis`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/nlohmann_json.natvis) for better debugging in MSVC (#844).\r\n- Overworked the documentation and added even more examples.\r\n- The build workflow now relies on CMake and CTest. Special flags can be chosen with CMake, including coverage (`JSON_Coverage`), compilation without exceptions (`JSON_NoExceptions`), LLVM sanitizers (`JSON_Sanitizer`), or execution with Valgrind (`JSON_Valgrind`).\r\n- Added support for package managers Meson (#576), Conan (#566), Hunter (#671, #829), and vcpkg (#753).\r\n- Added CI builders: Xcode 8.3, 9.0, 9.1, and 9.2; GCC 7.2; Clang 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, and 5.0; Visual Studio 2017. The library is further built with C++17 settings on the latest Clang, GCC, and MSVC version to quickly detect new issues.\r\n\r\n### Moving from 2.x.x to 3.0.0\r\n\r\n#### User-defined Exceptions\r\n\r\nThere are five different exceptions inheriting from [`json::exception`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a9a0aced019cb1d65bb49703406c84970.html#a9a0aced019cb1d65bb49703406c84970):\r\n\r\n- [`json::parse_error`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_af1efc2468e6022be6e35fc2944cabe4d.html#af1efc2468e6022be6e35fc2944cabe4d) for syntax errors (including the binary formats),\r\n- [`json::invalid_iterator`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_ac13d32f7cbd02d616e71d8dc30dadcbf.html#ac13d32f7cbd02d616e71d8dc30dadcbf) for errors related to iterators,\r\n- [`json::type_error`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a4010e8e268fefd86da773c10318f2902.html#a4010e8e268fefd86da773c10318f2902) for errors where functions were called with the wrong JSON type,\r\n- [`json::out_of_range`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a28f7c2f087274a0012eb7a2333ee1580.html#a28f7c2f087274a0012eb7a2333ee1580) for range errors, and\r\n- [`json::other_error`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a3333a5a8714912adda33a35b369f7b3d.html#a3333a5a8714912adda33a35b369f7b3d) for miscellaneous errors.\r\n\r\nTo support these exception, the `try`/`catch` blocks of your code need to be adjusted:\r\n\r\n| new exception | previous exception |\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n| parse_error.101 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.102 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.103 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.104 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.105 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.106 | domain_error |\r\n| parse_error.107 | domain_error |\r\n| parse_error.108 | domain_error |\r\n| parse_error.109 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.110 | out_of_range |\r\n| parse_error.111 | invalid_argument |\r\n| parse_error.112 | invalid_argument |\r\n| invalid_iterator.201 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.202 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.203 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.204 | out_of_range |\r\n| invalid_iterator.205 | out_of_range |\r\n| invalid_iterator.206 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.207 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.208 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.209 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.210 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.211 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.212 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.213 | domain_error |\r\n| invalid_iterator.214 | out_of_range |\r\n| type_error.301 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.302 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.303 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.304 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.305 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.306 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.307 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.308 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.309 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.310 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.311 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.313 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.314 | domain_error |\r\n| type_error.315 | domain_error |\r\n| out_of_range.401 | out_of_range |\r\n| out_of_range.402 | out_of_range |\r\n| out_of_range.403 | out_of_range |\r\n| out_of_range.404 | out_of_range |\r\n| out_of_range.405 | domain_error |\r\n| other_error.501 | domain_error |\r\n\r\n#### Handling of NaN and INF\r\n\r\n- If an overflow occurs during parsing a number from a JSON text, an exception [`json::out_of_range`](http://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a28f7c2f087274a0012eb7a2333ee1580.html#a28f7c2f087274a0012eb7a2333ee1580) is thrown so that the overflow is detected early and roundtripping is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n- NaN and INF floating-point values can be stored in a JSON value and are not replaced by null. That is, the basic_json class behaves like `double` in this regard (no exception occurs). However, NaN and INF are serialized to `null`.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of deprecated functions\r\n\r\nFunction `explicit basic_json(std::istream& i, const parser_callback_t cb = nullptr)` should be replaced by the `parse` function: Let `ss` be a stream and `cb` be a parse callback function.\r\n\r\nOld code:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\njson j(ss, cb);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew code:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\njson j = json::parse(ss, cb);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no callback function is used, also the following code works:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\njson j;\r\nj << ss;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\njson j;\r\nss >> j;\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/5545003","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/5545003/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/releases/5545003/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v2.1.1","id":5545003,"author":{"login":"nlohmann","id":159488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann","html_url":"https://github.com/nlohmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTU1NDUwMDM=","tag_name":"v2.1.1","target_commitish":"develop","name":"JSON

To do so, the whole number handling (lexer, parser, and also the serialization) have been overworked. Furthermore, a lot of small changes added up that were added to this release. All changes are backward-compatible.\n\n### Changes\n- :bug: Locales that have a different character than `.` as decimal separator (e.g., the Norwegian locale `nb_NO.UTF-8`) led to truncated number parsing or parse errors. The library now has been fixed to work with **any locale**. Note that `.` is still the only valid decimal separator for JSON input.\n- :bug: Numbers like `1.0` were correctly parsed as floating-point number, but serialized as integer (`1`). Now, **floating-point numbers correctly round trip**.\n- :bug: Parsing incorrect JSON numbers with leading 0 (`0123`) could yield a [buffer overflow](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/452). This is fixed now by detecting such errors directly by the lexer.\n- :bug: Constructing a JSON value from a pointer was incorrectly interpreted as a Boolean; such code will now yield a compiler error.\n- :bug: Comparing a JSON number with `0` led to a comparison with `null`. This is fixed now.\n- :bug: All throw calls are now wrapped in macros.\n- :lock: Starting during the preparation of this release (since 8 February 2017), commits and released files are **cryptographically signed** with [this GPG key](https://keybase.io/nlohmann/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=797167ae41c0a6d9232e48457f3cea63ae251b69). Previous releases have also been signed.\n- :sparkles: The parser for MessagePack and CBOR now supports an optional start index parameter to define a byte offset for the parser.\n- :rotating_light: Some more warnings have been fixed. With Clang, the code compiles **without warnings** with `-Weverything` (well, it needs `-Wno-documentation-unknown-command` and `-Wno-deprecated-declarations`, but you get the point).\n- :hammer: The code can be compiled easier with many Android NDKs by avoiding macros like `UINT8_MAX` which previously required defining a preprocessor macro for compilation.\n- :zap: The unit tests now compile two times faster.\n- :heavy_plus_sign: [Cotire](https://github.com/sakra/cotire) is used to speed up the build.\n- :pencil2: Fixed a lot of typos in the documentation.\n- :memo: Added a section to the README file that lists all used [third-party code/tools](https://github.com/nlohmann/json#used-third-party-tools).\n- :memo: Added a note on constructing a string value vs. parsing.\n- :white_check_mark: The test suite now contains 11202597 unit tests.\n- :memo: Improved the [Doxygen documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/) by shortening the template parameters of class `basic_json`.\n- :construction_worker: Removed Doozer.\n- :construction_worker: Added Codacity.\n- :arrow_up: Upgraded Catch to version 1.7.2.\n"}]
