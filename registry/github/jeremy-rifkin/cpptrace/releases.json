All symbols in the\r\n  public interface are now secretly in the `cpptrace::v1` namespace. This is an ABI break, but any ABI mismatch will\r\n  result in linker errors instead of silent bugs. This change is an effort to allow future evolution of cpptrace in a\r\n  way that respects ABI.\r\n- This version fixes a problem with returns from `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks on windows. Unfortunately, this macro has to use\r\n  an IILE on windows and as such `return` statements won't properly return from the enclosing function. This was a\r\n  footgun and now `return` statements in `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks are prevented from compiling on windows.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n- Added `cpptrace::try_catch` for handling multiple alternatives with access to current exception traces\r\n- Added `cpptrace::rethrow` utility for rethrowing exceptions from `CPPTRACE_CATCH` while preserving the stacktrace https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/214\r\n- Added utilities for getting the current trace from the last rethrow point\r\n  (`cpptrace::raw_trace_from_current_exception_rethrow`, `cpptrace::from_current_exception_rethrow`,\r\n  `cpptrace::current_exception_was_rethrown`)\r\n- Added a logger system to allow cpptrace to report errors in a configurable manner. By default, cpptrace doesn't log\r\n  anything. The following functions can be used to change this: (`cpptrace::set_log_level`,\r\n  `cpptrace::set_log_callback`, and `cpptrace::use_default_stderr_logger`)\r\n- Added `cpptrace::basename` utility\r\n- Added `cpptrace::prettify_type` utility\r\n- Added `cpptrace::prune_symbol` utility\r\n- Added formatter option for symbol formatting (`cpptrace::formatter::symbols`)\r\n- Added `cpptrace::detail::lazy_trace_holder::is_resolved`\r\n- Added support for C++20 modules https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/248\r\n- Added `cpptrace::load_symbols_for_file` to support DLLs loaded at runtime when using dbghelp https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/247\r\n\r\nRemoved\r\n- Removed `CPPTRACE_TRYZ` and `CPPTRACE_CATCHZ` macros\r\n- Removed the `CPPTRACE_CATCH_ALT` macro\r\n\r\nFixed\r\n- Fixed a problem where `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks could contain `return` statements but not return on windows due to an IILE. This is now an error. https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/245\r\n- Fixed cases where cpptrace could print to stderr on internal errors without the user desiring so https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/234\r\n- Fixed a couple internal locking mistakes\r\n- Fixed a couple of code paths that could be susceptible to static init order issues\r\n- Fixed bug with loading elf symbol tables that contain zero-sized entries\r\n- Fixed an incorrect assertion regarding looking up symbols at program counters that reside before any seen subprogram DIE https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/250\r\n- Fixed issue with `cpptrace::stacktrace::to_string()` ending with a newline on empty traces\r\n\r\nOther\r\n- Marked some paths in `CPPTRACE_CATCH` and `CPPTRACE_CATCHZ` as unreachable to improve usability in cases where the\r\n  compiler may warn about missing returns.\r\n- Improved resilience to libdwarf errors https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/251\r\n- Removed internal use of `std::is_trivial` which is deprecated in C++26 https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/236\r\n- Bumped libdwarf to 2.0.0\r\n- Added `--address` flag for internal symbol table tool\r\n- Various internal work to improve the codebase and reduce

Mach-O universal binaries\r\n\r\nOther improvements:\r\n- Improved documentation for installation and usage\r\n- Generally improved README content and organization\r\n- Fixed an MSVC workaround producing dozens of warnings\r\n- Better handle compiler color diagnostic arguments if compiler families differ\r\n- Improvements for handling libdwarf's header placement\r\n- Fixed issue with libunwind resolution\r\n- `-Werror` is now used in CI\r\n- More library configurations are now tested in CI\r\n- Updated to libdwarf 9\r\n- Updated the library's CMake to acquire zstd through
