On the `M1 Pro`, this translates into +20% speed for `xxh3` and `xxh128` (from 30.0 GB/s to 36 GB/s).\r\nSome of the changes are generic, so other platforms can be affected too, though typically to a lesser extend (~5%).\r\n\r\nOn `wasm`, speed fo `xxh3` is improved by a large factor x2 to x3 (depending on underlying hardware) through the use of `simd128` (@easyaspi314). This is especially efficient under the `v8` js engine, notably used by `chrome` and `node.js`. \r\n\r\nFinally, @hzhuang1 added support for the `arm`'s `SVE` vector extension. This is useful for server-side `aarch64` cpus with hardware support for wide vectors, such as Fujitsu's A64FX.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nNotable fixes in this update include the resolution of issues with `XXH3` `S390x` vector implementation, `PowerPC` vector compilation with IBM XL compiler, and `-Og` compilation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the command line interface (CLI) was refined with features such as support for comment lines in check files and commands such as `--binary` and `--ignore-missing` (@t-mat). Additionally, issues with filename containing `/LF` character were resolved.\r\n\r\nThe build process was also refined, with improvements such as fixing `pkgconfig` generation with `cmake` (@ilya-fedin), `icc` compilation, `cmake` install directories, and new build options to reduce binary size (@easyaspi314). Dedicated install targets were introduced (@ffontaine), and support for `DISPATCH` mode in cmake was added (@hzhuang1).\r\n\r\nIn terms of portability, the update includes the `SVE` vector implementation of `XXH3`, compatibility with freestanding environments using `XXH_NO_STDLIB`, and the ability to build on Haiku. The code has also been validated on `m68k` and `risc-v`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n`XXH3` finally has a [written specification](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/v0.8.2/doc/xxhash_spec.md), thanks to @Adrien1018 !\r\nSource code can also be digested by `doxygen` to generate code documentation automatically. An instance is now [available at homepage](https://xxhash.com/doc/v0.8.2/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n- fix  : XXH3 `S390x` vector implementation (@hzhuang1)\r\n- fix  : PowerPC vector

`v0.8.1` is a general clean up of the code base, following the stabilization of `xxh3` and `xxh128` in `v0.8.0`.\r\nThere are a few welcomed evolutions and improvements, but for the most part, this release consists of fixes for multiple corner cases and scenarios, that shall improve usability of `libxxhash` and `xxhsum` across a wide range of platforms.\r\nStable `API` entry points have not changed, all entry points labelled \"stable\" will continue to work as intended in this release and future ones.\r\n\r\n### Improved performance\r\n\r\nWhile the \"big picture\" is unchanged, there are a few notable improvements.\r\n`XXH3` / `XXH128` feature a large speed improvement in streaming mode, which is particularly sensible for `gcc` and `MSVC` (`clang` was already in good shape), by as much as +40%, making streaming speed essentially on par with single-shot mode when ingesting large quantities of data.\r\n\r\n`XXH64` and even `XXH32` feature improved latency performance for small inputs of random sizes. Perhaps as importantly, their binary size is smaller.\r\n\r\n### New capabilities\r\n\r\nThere is a new experimental `XXH3` variant, named `_withSecretandSeed()`. In a nutshell, it combines `seed` for small inputs, with `secret` for large inputs.\r\nThe main driver for this variant is a wish to skip the delay from `secret`'s transparent generation when using `_withSeed()` variant with large inputs, resulting in measurable performance drop for \"not so large\" sizes (< 1 KB) (note: this delay is insensible for \"large\" inputs, such as > 256 KB). Coupled with new function `XXH3_generateSecret_fromSeed()`, which generates the same secret as the one generated internally when using the `_withSeed()` variant, it results in exactly the same return values, while skipping the `secret` generation stage, thus improving speed.\r\n\r\nExperimental `XXH3_generateSecret()` has been extended to allow generation of `secret` of any size (though respecting the specification's minimum size). It's generally recommended to use this generator to ensure a source of \"high entropy\" for the `secret`.\r\n\r\nOn the CLI front, a highly demanded `xxhsum` feature was an ability to generate `XXH3` checksum values. This is achieved in `v0.8.1`, using the `--tag` format, which ensures that `XXH3` results cannot be confused with (default) `XXH64` ones, even though they feature the same 64-bit width.\r\n\r\n### Detailed changelist\r\n\r\n- perf : much improved performance for `XXH3` streaming variants, notably on `gcc` and `msvc`\r\n- perf : improved `XXH64` speed and latency on small inputs\r\n- perf : small `XXH32` speed and latency improvement on small inputs of random size\r\n- perf : minor stack usage improvement for `XXH32` and `XXH64`\r\n- api  : new experimental variants `XXH3_*_withSecretandSeed()`\r\n- api  : updated `XXH3_generateSecret()`, can now generate secret of any size (`>= XXH3_SECRET_SIZE_MIN`)\r\n- cli  : `xxhsum` can now generate and check `XXH3` checksums, using command `-H3`\r\n- build: can build xxhash without `XXH3`, with new build macro `XXH_NO_XXH3`\r\n- build: fix `xxh_x86dispatch` build with MSVC, by @apankrat\r\n- build: `XXH_INLINE_ALL` can always be used safely, even after `XXH_NAMESPACE` or a previous `XXH_INLINE_ALL`\r\n- build: improved PPC64LE vector support, by @mpe\r\n- install: fix pkgconfig, by @ellert\r\n- install: compatibility with Haiku, by @Begasus\r\n- doc  : code comments made compatible with doxygen, by @easyaspi314\r\n- misc : `XXH_ACCEPT_NULL_INPUT_POINTER` is no longer necessary, all functions can accept `NULL` input pointers, as long as `size == 0`\r\n- misc : complete refactor of CI tests on Github Actions, offering much larger coverage, by @t-mat\r\n- misc : `xxhsum` code base split into multiple specialized units, within directory `cli/`, by @easyaspi314","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/54264552/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"mentions_count":6},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/29000367","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/29000367/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/29000367/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.8.0","id":29000367,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI5MDAwMzY3","tag_name":"v0.8.0","target_commitish":"release","name":"xxHash v0.8.0 -

This limited `XXH3` to local sessions only.\r\nFrom now on, output values produced by `XXH3` for a given input and parameter set will remain identical across systems and across future versions. It makes it possible to store these values for later comparison, or to exchange them across network connections.\r\n\r\n### BSD-style checksums\r\nOfficial stabilization being the main goal of this release, there are only minimal additional changes.\r\nA notable one though is the ability for `xxhsum` CLI to produce and check BSD-style checksum lines, using command `--tag`.\r\nOne advantage of `--tag` format is that it explicitly specifies the algorithm and format used to represent the checksum. For example, it explicitly mentions if a checksum value follows the canonical format (`XXH32`) or the alternative little-endian format (`XXH32_LE`).\r\nGenerating BSD-style checksum lines was actually already possible, but as the CLI was unable to `--check` them, it remained a hidden option.\r\nThis situation changes with `v0.8.0`, thanks to a patch by @WayneD which makes it possible to `--check` BSD-style checksum lines.\r\n\r\n### Detailed list \r\n- api : stabilize XXH3\r\n- cli : `xxhsum` can produce BSD-style lines, with command `--tag`\r\n- cli : `xxhsum` can parse and check BSD-style lines, using command `--check`, by @WayneD\r\n- cli : `xxhsum -` accepts console input, requested by @jaki\r\n- cli : `xxhsum` accepts `--` separator, by @jaki\r\n- cli : fix : print correct default algo for symlinked helpers, by @martinetd\r\n- install: improved pkgconfig script, allowing custom install locations, requested by @ellert\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/27908066","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/27908066/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/27908066/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.7.4","id":27908066,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI3OTA4MDY2","tag_name":"v0.7.4","target_commitish":"dev","name":"xxHash v0.7.4 - Finalizing XXH3 and XXH128","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-06-25T06:32:16Z","published_at":"2020-06-25T09:17:59Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/assets/22063211","id":22063211,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDIyMDYzMjEx","name":"xxhsum_win64_0_7_4.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":178510,"download_count":197,"created_at":"2020-06-25T09:33:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T09:33:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/download/v0.7.4/xxhsum_win64_0_7_4.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/tarball/v0.7.4","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/zipball/v0.7.4","body":"xxHash `v0.7.4` is the last evolution of `xxh3` and `xxh128`, primarily designed to finalize the algorithm.\r\nIt is considered release candidate for `v0.8.0`, which means that if all goes right, this version will rebranded `v0.8.0`, almost \"as is\", within the next few weeks, after receiving sufficient feedback. \r\n`v0.8.0` is the official version after which `XXH3` and `XXH128` are considered \"stabilized\", meaning that return values will never change given the same `input` and `seed`, making the hash suitable for long-term storage and transmission.\r\n\r\nBeyond these \"final touches\", the new version also brings a few notable improvements.\r\n\r\n### Automatic vector detection\r\n\r\n`x86`/`x64` systems can enjoy a new unit, `xxh_x86dispatch`, which can detect at runtime the best vector instruction set present on host system (none, `sse2`, `avx2` or `avx512`), thanks to a cpu feature detector designed by @easyaspi314. It then automatically runs the appropriate vector code.\r\nThis makes it safer to deploy a single binary with advanced vector instruction sets, such as `AVX2`, since there is no hard requirement for _all_ target systems to actually support it : the binary can automatically switch to `SSE2` instead.\r\nAs a proof of concept, the windows builds provided alongside this release are compiled with this new capability.\r\n\r\n### `AVX512` support\r\n\r\nA new vector instruction set is supported, thanks to @gzm55 : `AVX512`. It can be applied on `XXH3` and `XXH128`, using some of the most recent Intel cpus, such as IceLake on laptop. It typically offers +50% more performance compared to `AVX2`.\r\n\r\n### Secret Generator\r\n\r\nAdvanced users can be interested in the highly customizable variant `_withSecret()`, which makes it possible to run `XXH3` and `XXH128` algorithms using one's own `secret`. \r\nHowever, the quality of the hash depends on the high entropy (randomness) of the `secret`. And sometimes, it can be difficult to ensure that the candidate `secret` is \"random enough\".\r\nIn order to produce a `secret` of high quality, a new function `XXH3_generateSecret()` is proposed in the advanced API section. It will convert any blob of bytes, named `customSeed`, into a high quality `secret` which respects all conditions expected by `XXH3` and `XXH128`. This is true even if `customSeed` itself is of poor quality, such as a bunch of `\\0` bytes or some short or repeated common sequence.\r\n\r\n### No API modification\r\n\r\nThe existing API present in 0.7.3 has remained unchanged in 0.7.4. Any programs linking with 0.7.3 should continue to work as-is.\r\nNote however that `xxh3`/`xxh128` return values are **not** comparable across these versions.\r\n0.7.x are labelled development versions, and should only be used for ephemeral data (hash produced and consume in the same local session).\r\n(note : this limitation does not extend to `XXH32` and `XXH64`, which are considered fully stable and specified).\r\n\r\n### Changelist\r\n\r\nThere are multiple smaller bug fixes and minor improvements that have been brought to this repository by great contributors. Here is a summarized list:\r\n- perf: automatic vector detection and selection at runtime (`xxh_x86dispatch.h`), initiated by @easyaspi314\r\n- perf: added `AVX512` support, by @gzm55\r\n- api : new: secret generator `XXH_generateSecret()`, suggested by @koraa\r\n- api : fix: `XXH3_state_t` is movable, identified by @koraa\r\n- api : fix: state is correctly aligned in AVX mode (unlike `malloc()`), by @easyaspi314\r\n- api : fix: streaming generated wrong values in some combination of random ingestion lengths, reported by @WayneD\r\n- cli : fix unicode print on Windows, by @easyaspi314\r\n- cli : can `-c` check file generated by `sfv`\r\n- build: `make DISPATCH=1` generates `xxhsum` and `libxxhash` with runtime vector detection (x86/x64 only)\r\n- install: cygwin installation support\r\n-

v0.7.3 is major evolution for `xxh3` and `xxh128`, with a focus on speed and dispersion performance.\r\n\r\n### Speed improvements\r\n\r\n`v0.7.3` pays a lot of attention to small data, by delivering generally faster latency metrics (about +10%).\r\n\r\nInlining is now a first class citizen, as it is generally key to best performance on small inputs.\r\nAmong the visible changes:\r\n- `XXH_INLINE_ALL` can always be set before including `xxhash.h`, even if `xxhash.h` was previously included (for example transitively, as part of a prior `*.h` header file).\r\n- The algorithm implementation has been transferred into `xxhash.h`. It's no longer necessary to keep a copy of `xxhash.c` in the `/include` directory for inlining to work correctly.\r\n  + Note: `xxhash.c` still exists, as it's useful to instantiate xxhash functions as public symbols accessible from a library or a `*.o` object file. It also remains compatible with existing projects.\r\n\r\nLarge data has also received a boost, which can go up to +20% for very large samples (> many MB).\r\n\r\nLet's underline the remarkable optimization work of @easyaspi314, who hand optimized several hot loops and instructions, and even added a new Z-vector target for `s390x` hardware.\r\n\r\n### No API modification\r\n\r\nThe API has remained completely stable between 0.7.2 and 0.7.3. Any programs linking with 0.7.2 should work as-is.\r\nNote that `xxh3`/`xxh128` results are **not** comparable across these versions.\r\n\r\n### New test tool\r\n\r\nTesting a 64-bit hash algorithm for its collision rate has remained elusive for most. The sheer volume of data required to assess quality at this scale is too large for traditional test tools like `SMHasher`. As a general guide, it requires 4 billion hashes to reach a 50% probability of getting a single collision. Accurate collision ratio evaluation requires many more hashes to actually measure something meaningful.\r\n\r\nA new open-source tool in `tests/collisions` offers this capability. It requires a **lot** of memory to run, with a minimum of 32 GB to measure anything significant. But provided that one has a system with enough capacity, it can accurately measure the collision ratio of any 64-bit hash algorithm.\r\n\r\nSeveral algorithms were measured thanks to this tool, the result of which is currently consolidated on [this wiki page](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/wiki/Collision-ratio-comparison). More can be added in the future.\r\n\r\nThis new development round also introduced several improvements to the `SMHasher` test suite, uncovering new requirements for new scenarios. This proved beneficial to improve the general dispersion qualities of `xxh3` and `xxh128`.\r\n\r\n### Changelist\r\n\r\nHere is a summarized list of changes for this version:\r\n- perf: improved speed for large inputs (~+20%)\r\n- perf: improved latency for small inputs (~10%)\r\n- perf: s390x Vectorial code, by @easyaspi314\r\n- cli: Improved support for Unicode filenames on Windows, thanks to @easyaspi314 and @t-mat\r\n- api: `xxhash.h` can now be included in any order, multiple times, with and without `XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY` or `XXH_INLINE_ALL`\r\n- build: xxHash's implementation has been transferred into `xxhash.h`. There is no more need to have `xxhash.c` in the `/include` directory for `XXH_INLINE_ALL` to work\r\n- install: created pkg-config file, by @bket\r\n- install: VCpkg installation instructions, by @LilyWangL\r\n- doc: Highly improved code documentation, by @easyaspi314\r\n- misc: New test tool in `/tests/collisions`: brute force collision tester for 64-bit hashes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/20547369","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/20547369/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/20547369/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.7.2","id":20547369,"author":{"login":"Cyan4973","id":750081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973","html_url":"https://github.com/Cyan4973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cyan4973/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIwNTQ3MzY5","tag_name":"v0.7.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"xxHash
