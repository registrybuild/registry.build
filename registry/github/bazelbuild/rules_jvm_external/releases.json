Changelog\r\n\r\nAfter updating to this release, please repin any of your lock files, as the format of this file has changed slightly. This can be done using `bazel run @unpinned_maven//:pin`. Not repinning isn't an error, but you may see some warnings during the build.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n  * @shs96c added `maven_install.fail_if_repin_required` which optionally allows builds to [fail if the list of maven dependencies has changed](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#requiring-lock-file-repinning-when-the-list-of-artifacts-changes) but the lock file has not been regenerated (#509)\r\n  * @shs96c added a `deploy_env` attribute to `java_export`, which behaves similarly to the one in [java_binary](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.0.0/be/java.html#java_binary.deploy_env) (#534)\r\n  * The `REPIN` environment variable used when repinning deps is also used by other rulesets, such as [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust). @gibfahn added `RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_REPIN` to allow only repinning the java deps (#555)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n  * @dhalperi updated `bazel run @maven//:outdated`, which is used to [list artifacts that could be updated](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#outdated-artifacts), by handling the case where artifact metadata is missing a `release` or `latest` tag (#508)\r\n  * @shs96c added code to generate pseudo-compile jars for downloaded dependencies. This should stop warnings about `bad path element` appearing during compilation (#518)\r\n  * @cheister fixed proxy parsing when the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable doesn't have a scheme (#541) (#542)\r\n  * @sitaktif noted that symlinks don't work well when using a Remote Build Environment. They replace symlinks in `maven_publish`'s `DefaultInfo` (#552)\r\n  * @cheister fixed the `stamp_enabled` flag so it continues to work as expected (#543)\r\n\r\n## Project health\r\n\r\n  * @shs96c made documentation `bzl_library` publicly visible.

Welcome, Chris!\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping us maintain this project, please contact us on the #maven channel on https://slack.bazel.build.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n- @cheister updated Coursier to 2.0.7 for https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/issues/471 (#482)\r\n- @cheister added a `@maven//:outdated` tool to check for updated versions of artifacts for a `maven_install` repository. To use it, run `bazel run @maven//:outdated`. (#465)\r\n- @ablyes added the ability to handle `@` in usernames. (#457)\r\n- @gibfahn added the ability to load MavenPublishInfo from `defs.bzl`. (#440)\r\n- @gibfahn added a provider to `maven_publish` targets to export the information being published for improved interoperability with other rules (#439)\r\n- @divanorama enabled COURSIER_OPTS to be available for the internal coursier invocation (#496)\r\n- @erickj added a `fetch_javadoc` attribute to maven_install to fetch javadoc targets, similar to `fetch_sources` for source jars. (#494) (#495)\r\n- @dmivankov enabled @unpinned_maven//:pin to be always visible regardless of `strict_visibility` in order to be used in run-based rules like `multirun`. (#492)\r\n- @zacharya19 added google cloud storage support to java_export (#463)\r\n- @shs96c introduced an optional `deps` and a `setup` macro to allow rules_jvm_external to pull in its own external dependencies, like for Google Cloud Storage support (#481)\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- @shs96c reworked how maven project jars are calculated to correctly include and exclude classes, in the context of situations like Protobuf dependencies and aspects. See the PR for more information. (#475)\r\n- @cheister fixed `Target-Label` manifest stamping with a custom AddJarManifestEntry class, which maintains consistent timestamps of the jar manifest to make local and remote caching work correctly. \r\n- @dmivankov fixed an issue with correctly computing leading zeroes in `java_export` checksums (#453)\r\n- @alexeagle fixed the path of `jq` in `@maven//:pin` to make it runnable (#454)\r\n- @dmivankov fixed the spelling of the auth scheme as \"Basic\" for Artifactory headers (#452)\r\n- @gibfahn fixed a bug with `tags` in the java_export rule (#444)\r\n- @shs96c fixed an issue with `--frames`, publishing rules on JDK 13 (#460)\r\n\r\n#### Project health\r\n\r\n- @cheister applied a cleanup to use BUILD instead of BUILD.bazel and buildifer these BUILD files (#470)\r\n- @cheister refactored MergeJar to use JarHelper jar entry timestamp logic (#469)\r\n- @jin added a regression test to ensure version intervals keep working.
