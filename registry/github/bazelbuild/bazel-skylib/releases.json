The functionality in this module can be used to capture a function and, optionally, a subset of its arguments in a value that can be passed to other functions or stored and then called at a later time.\r\n\r\n* Added a new `sets` module (which can be loaded from `lib.bzl` as `new_sets` or from `new_sets.bzl` as `sets`). This new module implements hashed sets via an underlying dictionary and has better performance than the original `sets` module, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/10073773","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/10073773/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/10073773/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/tag/0.3.1","id":10073773,"author":{"login":"allevato","id":1062427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1062427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato","html_url":"https://github.com/allevato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allevato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEwMDczNzcz","tag_name":"0.3.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.3.1","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-03-07T19:30:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T22:09:58Z","published_at":"2018-03-13T22:09:58Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/tarball/0.3.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/zipball/0.3.1","body":"`paths.relativize`
