Rules like genrule can tool-depend on it, and it can be\r\n        executed with \"bazel run\". This rule can also augment the binary with\r\n        runfiles.\r\n    -   native_test() is similar, but creates a testable rule instead of a\r\n        binary rule.\r\n    -   Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/issues/148\r\n\r\n-   diff_test: test rule compares two files and passes if the files match.\r\n    -   On Linux/macOS/non-Windows, the test compares files using 'diff'.\r\n    -    On Windows, the test compares files using 'fc.exe'.\r\n    -    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5508, https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4319\r\n\r\n-   maprule: move functionality to maprule_util.bzl.\r\n    maprule_util.bzl will benefit planned new rules (namely a genrule alternative).\r\n\r\n**This release is tested with Bazel 0.28**\r\n\r\n\r\n**WORKSPACE setup**\r\n\r\n```\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:utils.bzl\", \"maybe\")\r\n\r\nmaybe(\r\n    http_archive,\r\n    name = \"bazel_skylib\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/download/0.9.0/bazel_skylib-0.9.0.tar.gz\",\r\n    sha256 = \"1dde365491125a3db70731e25658dfdd3bc5dbdfd11b840b3e987ecf043c7ca0\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@bazel_skylib//:workspace.bzl\", \"bazel_skylib_workspace\")\r\nbazel_skylib_workspace()\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/16240115","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/16240115/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/16240115/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/tag/0.8.0","id":16240115,"author":{"login":"sergiocampama","id":689198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTE5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama","html_url":"https://github.com/sergiocampama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2MjQwMTE1","tag_name":"0.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.8.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-03-20T17:13:32Z","published_at":"2019-03-20T18:50:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/assets/11639351","id":11639351,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDExNjM5MzUx","name":"bazel-skylib.0.8.0.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"sergiocampama","id":689198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTE5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama","html_url":"https://github.com/sergiocampama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergiocampama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":72941,"download_count":4798964,"created_at":"2019-03-20T18:02:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T18:02:51Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/releases/download/0.8.0/bazel-skylib.0.8.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/tarball/0.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/zipball/0.8.0","body":"**New Features**\r\n* “Analysis Test” testing framework under unittest.bzl.

This is similar to the existing `build_test` rule, except that actions of the underlying targets are not executed.
