What's Changed\r\nStarting this release, rules_go no longer ship with `@go_googleapis` repo. Together with Gazelle v0.32.0, it means that all Go code importing generated code from Google APIs will depend on `@org_golang_google_genproto`, which is resolved by Go modules. For proto files importing Google APIs proto and generating Go code, users need to:\r\n\r\n1. Add an `http_archive` rule to download Google APIs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"googleapis\",\r\n    sha256 = \"9d1a930e767c93c825398b8f8692eca3fe353b9aaadedfbcf1fca2282c85df88\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"googleapis-64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/archive/64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@googleapis//:repository_rules.bzl\", \"switched_rules_by_language\")\r\n\r\nswitched_rules_by_language(\r\n    name = \"com_google_googleapis_imports\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of Google APIs archive needs to be compatible with the pre-generated code in `@org_golang_google_genproto`.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve the proto manually. If Gazelle is being used, directives like the following need to be added to a parent directory of the proto files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto proto google/rpc/status.proto @googleapis//google/rpc:status_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/rpc/status.proto  @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/rpc/status\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto google/longrunning/operations.proto @googleapis//google/longrunning:operations_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/longrunning/operations.proto @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/longrunning\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther changes included in this release\r\n\r\n* detect_sdk_version: Support 1.21's new VERSION file format by @evanj in

Major new features\r\n\r\n* The Go runfiles library developed by @phst at https://github.com/phst/runfiles is now available as `github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/go/runfiles` (target `@io_bazel_rules_go//go/runfiles`) and is now the official way to look up runfiles from Go. It will be made compatible with Bzlmod in a future release.\r\n**Note:** For improved consistency with runfiles libraries in other languages, the `Path` function present in https://github.com/phst/runfiles is called `Rlocation` in rules_go.\r\n* Adding two new command line flags `--@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:gc_goopts` and `--@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:gc_linkopts` to accept additional compiler and linker flags.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* bzlmod: Use register_toolchains by @fmeum in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/pull/3290\r\n* Remove unused

Changes\r\n\r\n- Add first class support for GOOS=ios (#3013)\r\n- Always include debug symbols with -c dbg (#3029)\r\n\r\n  Previously, debugging a go_test target was only possible with an explicit --@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:debug.\r\n\r\n- go_test: Add env attribute (#3004)\r\n\r\n  This allows setting environment variables before static initialisers run, and which reference expanded locations.\r\n\r\n- tests/core/cgo: do not assume test is being run from main repo (#2956)\r\n- reproducibility_test: explicitly build the go_sdk builder (#3026)\r\n- map bazel's --test_runner_fail_fast to go's -failfast (#3058)\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Emit correct header in CGo c-archive (#2874)\r\n- Append path into trimpath if option already exists (#2994)\r\n- Fixed issue with `go_bazel_test` rule on Windows (#3036)\r\n- Skipping linker flag for versioned dylib on Darwin (#2989)\r\n- Trim absolute paths in files generated by cgo (#3011)\r\n- builders/cover: register coverage without changing line numbers (#2993)\r\n- cover: use Z instead of underscore for variable name separator (#2995)\r\n- .bazelci/presubmit.yml: remove old flag (#3023)\r\n- builders/gentestmain: register correct cover mode in the coverage report file when enabling race mode (#3019)\r\n- -fsanitize-ignorelist should have an absolute path (#3001)\r\n- internal changes: #2942, #2987, #2988, #2992, #3000, #3035, #3038, #3046\r\n\r\nThanks to all of the contributors\r\n\r\n# Compatibility\r\n\r\n- Bazel 4.2.1 or higher is now required.

Changes\r\n\r\n* Experimental editor / IDE integration added in the form of a\r\n  gopackagesdriver tool that reports information about the Bazel workspace\r\n  to gopls (or any other tool based on `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages`).\r\n  See the [Editor setup](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/wiki/Editor-setup)\r\n  on the wiki for information and setup instructions. Huge thanks to @steeve\r\n  for shipping this.\r\n* Target platform may be automatically inferred from `--crosstool_top` and\r\n  `--cpu` for iOS and Android platforms that still require these flags.\r\n  Again, thanks to @steeve.\r\n* `go_proto_library` no longer implicitly depends on APIv1 Well Known Type\r\n  packages. Since protoc 3.14, the Well Known Types declare APIv2 package paths,\r\n  which means generated code that imports them will import APIv2 packages,\r\n  so the APIv1 dependencies are unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Bazel 4.0.0 (LTS) or higher is now required. The previous minimum version\r\n  was 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n## Updated dependencies\r\n\r\nAs always, you can use higher versions of rules\\_go's dependencies by declaring\r\nthem in WORKSPACE before calling `go_rules_dependencies`.

Changes\r\n\r\n* `//go:embed` directives are supported in Go 1.16. Patterns are matched against both static and generated files, including directory artifacts. Embeddable files must be listed in the new `embedsrcs` attribute. Gazelle v0.23.0 will generate these attributes automatically.\r\n* `go_binary` now provides `CcInfo` in the `c-archive` and `c-shared` link modes. This should let `cc_library` and other rules reference these targets through `deps` directly. Thanks @steeve.\r\n* `TEST_TMPDIR` is no longer set to `TMPDIR` in tests. Thanks @mikedanese.\r\n* Several small improvements in error and diagnostic output.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Bazel 3.5.0 is now required.
