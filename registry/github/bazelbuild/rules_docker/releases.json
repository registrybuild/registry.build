`client_config` becomes a Bazel label instead of an absolute path. Existing applications have to put their `config.json` in a Bazel repository, add Bazel rule to export it, and refer it as a label in `toolchain_configure`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed:\r\n1. remove dependency on external python for sha256 (#1993)\r\n2. Update rules kotlin (#2030)\r\n3. Specifying client config.json with Bazel label (#2032)\r\n4. perf: remove no-remote-cache execution requirements (#2043)\r\n5. stop printing output on successful operations (#2047)\r\n6. Stamp e2e tests (#2000)\r\n7. Fix flaky tests. Use jq to sort JSON arrays before comparing them. (#2007)\r\n8. Replace python with python3 in incremental_load.sh.tpl (#2051)\r\n9. Changing docker client config attributes to Bazel labels (#2042)\r\n10. Clean unused package oci/ (#2061)\r\n11. Run script allows empty docker_args (#2053)\r\n12. Support credential helpers in container_pull (#2034)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/65265612/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/57952146","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/57952146/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/57952146/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/tag/v0.23.0","id":57952146,"author":{"login":"gravypod","id":902107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjEwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/902107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod","html_url":"https://github.com/gravypod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBSuyy84DdEeS","tag_name":"v0.23.0","target_commitish":"c27194b35f56a1bea6e37f58e549230823653dc3","name":"Various updates & fixes","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-01-24T14:22:28Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T23:24:11Z","published_at":"2022-01-25T18:55:51Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/assets/54935418","id":54935418,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBSuyy84DRj96","name":"rules_docker-v0.23.0.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"gravypod","id":902107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjEwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/902107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod","html_url":"https://github.com/gravypod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gravypod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":595879,"digest":null,"download_count":1095018,"created_at":"2022-01-25T18:55:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T18:55:55Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/download/v0.23.0/rules_docker-v0.23.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/tarball/v0.23.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_docker/zipball/v0.23.0","body":"Copy the following into your WORKSPACE file to use rules_docker at release v0.23.0\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"io_bazel_rules_docker\",\r\n    sha256 = \"85ffff62a4c22a74dbd98d05da6cf40f497344b3dbf1e1ab0a37ab2a1a6ca014\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_docker-0.23.0\",\r\n    urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases/download/v0.23.0/rules_docker-v0.23.0.tar.gz\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nThanks to @uhthomas we now use Bazel Transitions to request dependencies for the docker target platform.

to make non-deterministic, VCS-stamped outputs based on whether a `{` character appeared in certain attributes. Some rules had a (deprecated) `stamp` boolean attribute which affected this behavior all builds of that target. This makes it easy to accidentally bust the Bazel cache, for example a test that depends on a `container_image` might re-run every time because the image's tag changed with each git SHA.\r\n\r\nAs of this release, you should run `bazel build --stamp` enable stamped outputs.\r\n\r\nTo override this on a single target, the `stamp` attribute on these three rules is now a trinary, just like in other rulesets like [rules_python](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/python.html#py_binary.stamp)\r\n- in place of `stamp = False` you should use `stamp = \"@io_bazel_rules_docker//stamp:never\"`\r\n- in place of `stamp = True` you should use `stamp = \"@io_bazel_rules_docker//stamp:always\"`\r\n- if no value for `stamp` attribute is given, the default is based on the  [`--[no]stamp`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/user-manual.html#flag--stamp) configuration of the build.\r\n\r\nFor more ideas on using this, see the blog post by the author of the stamping PR: https://blog.aspect.dev/stamping-bazel-builds-with-selective-delivery \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* feat: add timeout attribute to container_pull by @alexeagle in

container/bundle.bzl: improve bundle rules doc by @sluongng in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/pull/1975\r\n* Add generated comment in generated file by @alexeagle in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/pull/1894\r\n* Add tool target attribute to docker toolchain by @moshe in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/pull/1946\r\n* toolchain: allow to

`container_bundle` (in container/bundle.bzl)\r\n  - `container_image` (in container/image.bzl)\r\n  - `container_import` (in container/import.bzl)\r\n  - `filter_layer` (in lang/image.bzl)\r\n\r\n  Actions Required by Rule\r\n  - `container_bundle`\r\nIf you use the `container_images` and/or the `stamp` field of the returned struct, then get these fields from the returned `BundleInfo` provider as shown [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/blob/5647f4f7a6b7c247e788675963e2e03a6e7156e1/contrib/push-all.bzl#L31-L32).\r\n  -

`container_import`\r\nIf you use the `container_parts` field of the returned struct, then get this field from the returned `ImportInfo` provider (e.g. `target[ImportInfo].container_parts` instead of `target.container_parts`)\r\n  - `filter_layer`\r\nIf you use the `py` field of the returned struct as `target.py`, then get this field using the returned `PyInfo` provider as `target[PyInfo]`.\r\n\r\n  _Note_\r\nIf you access the returned providers with the following syntax:\r\n`target.providers[<index>].<field>`\r\nthen you most likely need to change this to:\r\n`target[<index>].<field>`\r\n\r\n# New Rules\r\n* Repo rule to build an image from Dockerfile and save as tar (#737)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n* Support using Kaniko to build images.
