`client_config` becomes a Bazel label instead of an absolute path. Existing applications have to put their `config.json` in a Bazel repository, add Bazel rule to export it, and refer it as a label in `toolchain_configure`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed:\r\n1. remove dependency on external python for sha256 (#1993)\r\n2. Update rules kotlin (#2030)\r\n3. Specifying client config.json with Bazel label (#2032)\r\n4. perf: remove no-remote-cache execution requirements (#2043)\r\n5. stop printing output on successful operations (#2047)\r\n6. Stamp e2e tests (#2000)\r\n7. Fix flaky tests. Use jq to sort JSON arrays before comparing them. (#2007)\r\n8. Replace python with python3 in incremental_load.sh.tpl (#2051)\r\n9. Changing docker client config attributes to Bazel labels (#2042)\r\n10. Clean unused package oci/ (#2061)\r\n11. Run script allows empty docker_args (#2053)\r\n12.

to make non-deterministic, VCS-stamped outputs based on whether a `{` character appeared in certain attributes. Some rules had a (deprecated) `stamp` boolean attribute which affected this behavior all builds of that target. This makes it easy to accidentally bust the Bazel cache, for example a test that depends on a `container_image` might re-run every time because the image's tag changed with each git SHA.\r\n\r\nAs of this release, you should run `bazel build --stamp` enable stamped outputs.\r\n\r\nTo override this on a single target, the `stamp` attribute on these three rules is now a trinary, just like in other rulesets like [rules_python](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/python.html#py_binary.stamp)\r\n- in place of `stamp = False` you should use `stamp = \"@io_bazel_rules_docker//stamp:never\"`\r\n- in place of `stamp = True` you should use `stamp = \"@io_bazel_rules_docker//stamp:always\"`\r\n- if no value for `stamp` attribute is given, the default is based on the  [`--[no]stamp`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/user-manual.html#flag--stamp) configuration of the build.\r\n\r\nFor more ideas on using this, see the blog post by the author of the stamping PR: https://blog.aspect.dev/stamping-bazel-builds-with-selective-delivery \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* feat: add timeout attribute to container_pull by @alexeagle in
