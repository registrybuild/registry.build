Fixes\r\n  [#2091](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2090).\r\n* (gazelle) Make `gazelle_python_manifest.update` manual to avoid unnecessary\r\n  network behavior.\r\n* (bzlmod): The conflicting toolchains during `python` extension will no longer\r\n  cause warnings by default. In order to see the warnings for diagnostic purposes\r\n  set the env var `RULES_PYTHON_REPO_DEBUG_VERBOSITY` to one of `INFO`, `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.\r\n  Fixes [#1818](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1818).\r\n* (runfiles) Make runfiles lookups work for the situation of Bazel 7,\r\n  Python 3.9 (or earlier, where safepath isn't present), and the Rlocation call\r\n  in the same directory as the main file.\r\n  Fixes [#1631](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1631).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n* (pypi) `compile_pip_requirements` supports multiple requirements input files as `srcs`.\r\n* (rules) `PYTHONSAFEPATH` is inherited from the calling environment to allow\r\n  disabling it (Requires {obj}`--bootstrap_impl=script`)\r\n  ([#2060](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2060)).\r\n* (gazelle) Added `python_generation_mode_per_package_require_test_entry_point`\r\n  in order to better accommodate users who use a custom macro,\r\n  [`pytest-bazel`][pytest_bazel], [rules_python_pytest] or `rules_py`\r\n  [py_test_main] in order to integrate with `pytest`. Currently the default\r\n  flag value is set to `true` for backwards compatible behaviour, but in the\r\n  future the flag will be flipped be `false` by default.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.12.4` using the [20240726] release.\r\n* (pypi) Support env markers in requirements files. Note, that this means that\r\n  if your requirements files contain env markers, the Python interpreter will\r\n  need to be run during bzlmod phase to evaluate them. This may incur\r\n  downloading an interpreter (for hermetic-based builds) or cause non-hermetic\r\n  behavior (if using a system Python).\r\n\r\n[rules_python_pytest]:

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1913) of the plugin being tricky to cross-compile, so please leave comments there if you are seeing issues.\r\n* The dependence on the system having a Python interpreter can now be avoided if using a hermetic toolchain. This can be enabled with [bootstrap_impl](https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/python/config_settings/index.html#bootstrap_impl) config setting.\r\n* The `MODULE.bazel.lock` file is now the same irrespective of the host platform that `rules_python` is being used on. This required to remove host-platform specific references in `@pythons_hub//:interpreters.bzl`, so if you want to use a host python in a repository rule context, use `@python_{version}_host//:python`.\r\n* The python files can now be compiled to `.pyc` during the `bazel build` phase, enable this with `@rules_python//python/config_settings:precompile=enabled` config setting, more info in the [docs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/blob/main/precompiling).\r\n* `whl_filegroup` can now be used to extract files from a `whl` target. This is useful in cases where one wants to use e.g. `numpy` headers or similar. The benefit of this is that users don’t need to modify the `pip.parse` whl distributions and can have better performance (no need to refetch the pip packages when the desired file list changes) and ergonomics through build-time rules.\r\n* `experimental_index_url` flag in `pip.parse` now enables using the whl filenames to derive the target platform config settings, so you can finally get the right wheel for the right target platform. It is best to use this feature together with `requirements_by_platform` (also added in 0.33.0) to specify requirements files per (os, arch) explicitly. We now also do not ignore yanked packages which mirrors the behaviour of `uv` more closely. The users have a few config settings that they can use to change the behaviour (preference of `universal2` wheels on osx, preference of `musllinux` and the libc version on linux, disabling `sdist`). The config settings are documented [here](https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypi-dependencies.html#bazel-downloader-and-multi-platform-wheel-hub-repository).\r\n\r\nSee the full [changelog

We are also removing values that are not\r\n  default in order to reduce the size of the lock file.\r\n* (coverage) Bump `coverage.py` to [7.4.3](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-743--2024-02-23).\r\n* (deps): Bumped bazel_features to 1.9.1 to detect optional support\r\n  non-blocking downloads.\r\n* (deps): Updated `pip_tools` to >= 7.4.0\r\n* (toolchains): Change some old toolchain versions to use [20240224] release to\r\n  include security fixes `3.8.18`, `3.9.18` and `3.10.13`\r\n* (toolchains): Bump default toolchain versions to:\r\n    * `3.8 -> 3.8.19`\r\n    * `3.9 -> 3.9.19`\r\n    * `3.10 -> 3.10.14`\r\n    * `3.11 -> 3.11.9`\r\n    * `3.12 -> 3.12.3`\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n* (whl_library): Fix the experimental_target_platforms overriding for platform\r\n  specific wheels when the wheels are for any python interpreter version. Fixes\r\n  [#1810](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1810).\r\n* (whl_library): Stop generating duplicate dependencies when encountering\r\n  duplicates in the METADATA. Fixes\r\n  [#1873](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1873).\r\n* (gazelle) In `project` or `package` generation modes, do not generate `py_test`\r\n  rules when there are no test files and do not set `main = \"__test__.py\"` when\r\n  that file doesn't exist.\r\n* (whl_library) The group redirection is only added when the package is part of\r\n  the group potentially fixing aspects that want to traverse a `py_library` graph.\r\n  Fixes [#1760](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1760).\r\n* (bzlmod) Setting a particular micro version for the interpreter and the\r\n  `pip.parse` extension is now possible, see the\r\n  `examples/pip_parse/MODULE.bazel` for how to do it.\r\n  See [#1371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1371).\r\n* (refactor) The pre-commit developer workflow should now pass `isort` and `black`\r\n  checks (see [#1674](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1674)).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* (toolchains) Added armv7 platform definition for python toolchains.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.11.8`, `3.12.2` using the [20240224] release.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.8.19`, `3.9.19`, `3.10.14`, `3.11.9`, `3.12.3` using\r\n  the [20240415] release.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_visibility` directive to control visibility\r\n  of generated targets by appending additional visibility labels.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_default_visibility` directive to control the\r\n  _default_ visibility of generated targets. See the [docs][python_default_visibility]\r\n  for details.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_test_file_pattern` directive. This directive tells\r\n  gazelle which python files should be mapped to the `py_test` rule. See the\r\n  [original issue][test_file_pattern_issue] and the [docs][test_file_pattern_docs]\r\n  for details.\r\n* (wheel) Add support for `data_files` attributes in py_wheel rule\r\n  ([#1777](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1777))\r\n* (py_wheel) `bzlmod` installations now provide a `twine` setup for the default\r\n  Python toolchain in `rules_python` for version 3.11.\r\n* (bzlmod) New `experimental_index_url`, `experimental_extra_index_urls` and\r\n  `experimental_index_url_overrides` to `pip.parse` for using the bazel\r\n  downloader. If you see any issues, report in\r\n  [#1357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1357). The URLs for\r\n  the whl and sdist files will be written to the lock file. Controlling whether\r\n  the downloading of metadata is done in parallel can be done using\r\n  `parallel_download` attribute.\r\n* (gazelle) Add a new annotation `include_dep`. Also add documentation for\r\n  annotations to `gazelle/README.md`.\r\n* (deps): `rules_python` depends now on `rules_cc` 0.0.9\r\n* (pip_parse): A new flag `use_hub_alias_dependencies` has been added that is going\r\n  to become default in the next release. This makes use of `dep_template` flag\r\n  in the `whl_library` rule. This also affects the\r\n  `experimental_requirement_cycles` feature where the dependencies that are in\r\n  a group would be only accessible via the hub repo aliases. If you still\r\n  depend on legacy labels instead of the hub repo aliases and you use the\r\n  `experimental_requirement_cycles`, now is a good time to migrate.\r\n\r\n[python_default_visibility]: gazelle/README.md#directive-python_default_visibility\r\n[test_file_pattern_issue]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1816\r\n[test_file_pattern_docs]: gazelle/README.md#directive-python_test_file_pattern\r\n[20240224]: https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240224.\r\n[20240415]: https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240415.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/compare/0.32.0...0.32.1"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/155425442","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/155425442/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/155425442/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/tag/0.32.0","id":155425442,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBhEMNM4JQ5qi","tag_name":"0.32.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"0.32.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-05-13T01:55:37Z","published_at":"2024-05-13T02:14:59Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/assets/167549522","id":167549522,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBhEMNM4J_JpS","name":"rules_python-0.32.0.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":614358,"download_count":10967,"created_at":"2024-05-13T02:15:00Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T02:15:00Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/download/0.32.0/rules_python-0.32.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/tarball/0.32.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_python/zipball/0.32.0","body":"## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6\r\n\r\n**NOTE: bzlmod support is still beta.

Fixes\r\n  [#1873](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1873).\r\n* (gazelle) In `project` or `package` generation modes, do not generate `py_test`\r\n  rules when there are no test files and do not set `main = \"__test__.py\"` when\r\n  that file doesn't exist.\r\n* (whl_library) The group redirection is only added when the package is part of\r\n  the group potentially fixing aspects that want to traverse a `py_library` graph.\r\n  Fixes [#1760](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1760).\r\n* (bzlmod) Setting a particular micro version for the interpreter and the\r\n  `pip.parse` extension is now possible, see the\r\n  `examples/pip_parse/MODULE.bazel` for how to do it.\r\n  See [#1371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1371).\r\n* (refactor) The pre-commit developer workflow should now pass `isort` and `black`\r\n  checks (see [#1674](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1674)).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* (toolchains) Added armv7 platform definition for python toolchains.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.11.8`, `3.12.2` using the [20240224] release.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.8.19`, `3.9.19`, `3.10.14`, `3.11.9`, `3.12.3` using\r\n  the [20240415] release.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_visibility` directive to control visibility\r\n  of generated targets by appending additional visibility labels.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_default_visibility` directive to control the\r\n  _default_ visibility of generated targets. See the [docs][python_default_visibility]\r\n  for details.\r\n* (gazelle) Added a new `python_test_file_pattern` directive. This directive tells\r\n  gazelle which python files should be mapped to the `py_test` rule. See the\r\n  [original issue][test_file_pattern_issue] and the [docs][test_file_pattern_docs]\r\n  for details.\r\n* (wheel) Add support for `data_files` attributes in py_wheel rule\r\n  ([#1777](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1777))\r\n* (py_wheel) `bzlmod` installations now provide a `twine` setup for the default\r\n  Python toolchain in `rules_python` for version 3.11.\r\n* (bzlmod) New `experimental_index_url`, `experimental_extra_index_urls` and\r\n  `experimental_index_url_overrides` to `pip.parse` for using the bazel\r\n  downloader. If you see any issues, report in\r\n  [#1357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1357). The URLs for\r\n  the whl and sdist files will be written to the lock file. Controlling whether\r\n  the downloading of metadata is done in parallel can be done using\r\n  `parallel_download` attribute.\r\n* (gazelle) Add a new annotation `include_dep`. Also add documentation for\r\n  annotations to `gazelle/README.md`.\r\n* (deps): `rules_python` depends now on `rules_cc` 0.0.9\r\n* (pip_parse): A new flag `use_hub_alias_dependencies` has been added that is going\r\n  to become default in the next release. This makes use of `dep_template` flag\r\n  in the `whl_library` rule. This also affects the\r\n  `experimental_requirement_cycles` feature where the dependencies that are in\r\n  a group would be only accessible via the hub repo aliases. If you still\r\n  depend on legacy labels instead of the hub repo aliases and you use the\r\n  `experimental_requirement_cycles`, now is a good time to migrate.\r\n\r\n[python_default_visibility]:

Changed in this release\r\n\r\n* Python version patch level bumps:\r\n  * 3.8.15  -> 3.8.18\r\n  * 3.9.17  -> 3.9.18\r\n  * 3.10.12 -> 3.10.13\r\n  * 3.11.4  -> 3.11.6\r\n\r\n* (deps) Upgrade rules_go 0.39.1 -> 0.41.0; this is so gazelle integration works with upcoming Bazel versions\r\n\r\n* (multi-version) The `distribs` attribute is no longer propagated. This attribute has been long deprecated by Bazel and shouldn't be used.\r\n* Calling `//python:repositories.bzl#py_repositories()` is required. It has always been documented as necessary, but it was possible to omit it in certain cases. An error about `@rules_python_internal` means the `py_repositories()` call is missing in `WORKSPACE`.\r\n* (bzlmod) The `pip.parse` extension will generate os/arch specific lock file entries on `bazel>=6.4`.\r\n\r\n## Removed in this release\r\n\r\n* (bzlmod) The `entry_point` macro is no longer supported and has been removed in favor of the `py_console_script_binary` macro for `bzlmod` users.\r\n* (bzlmod) The `pip.parse` no longer generates `{hub_name}_{py_version}` hub repos as the `entry_point` macro has been superseded by `py_console_script_binary`.\r\n* (bzlmod) The `pip.parse` no longer generates `{hub_name}_{distribution}` hub repos.\r\n\r\n## Added in this release\r\n\r\n* (bzlmod, entry_point) Added [`py_console_script_binary`](./docs/py_console_script_binary.md), which allows adding custom dependencies to a package's entry points and customizing the `py_binary` rule used to build it.\r\n* New Python versions available: `3.8.17`, `3.11.5` using\r\n  https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20230826.\r\n* (gazelle) New `# gazelle:python_generation_mode file` directive to support generating one `py_library` per file.\r\n* (python_repository) Support `netrc` and `auth_patterns` attributes to enable authentication against private HTTP hosts serving Python toolchain binaries.\r\n* `//python:packaging_bzl` added, a `bzl_library` for the Starlark files `//python:packaging.bzl` requires.\r\n* (py_wheel) Added the `incompatible_normalize_name` feature flag to normalize the package distribution name according to latest Python packaging standards. Defaults to `False` for the time being.\r\n* (py_wheel) Added the `incompatible_normalize_version` feature flag to normalize the package version according to PEP440 standard. This also adds support for local version specifiers (versions with a `+` in them), in accordance with PEP440. Defaults to `False` for the time being.\r\n* New Python versions available: `3.8.18`, `3.9.18`, `3.10.13`, `3.11.6`, `3.12.0` using https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20231002. `3.12.0` support is considered beta and may have issues.\r\n\r\n## Fixed in this release\r\n\r\n* (whl_library) No longer restarts repository rule when fetching external dependencies improving initial build times involving external dependency fetching.\r\n* (gazelle) Improve runfiles lookup hermeticity.\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6\r\n\r\n**NOTE: bzlmod support is still beta. APIs subject to change.**\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_python\", version = \"0.26.0\")\r\n\r\npip =

Notable and Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n### Bzlmod extension paths have changed\r\n\r\nAs part of fixing some fundamental issues with the bzlmod support, we had to change the path to our extensions. Instead of all extensions being in a single `extensions.bzl` file, each extension is in its own file. Users must update the file path in their `use_repo()` statements as follows:\r\n\r\n* `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"python\")` -> `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")`\r\n* `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"pip\")` -> `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")`\r\n\r\nThe following `sed` commands should approximate the necessary changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsed 'sXuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"python\")Xuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")X'`\r\nsed 'sXuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"pip\")Xuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")X'`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee `examples/bzlmod_build_file_generation/MODULE.bazel` for an example of the new paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lockfile output churn\r\n\r\nThe output of lockfiles has slightly changed. Though functionally the same, their integrity hashes will change.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6\r\n\r\nNOTE: Bzlmod support is still in beta.\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_python\", version = \"0.22.0\")\r\n\r\npip = use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")\r\n\r\npip.parse(\r\n    name = \"pip\",\r\n    requirements_lock = \"//:requirements_lock.txt\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nuse_repo(pip, \"pip\")\r\n\r\n# (Optional) Register a specific python toolchain instead of using the host version\r\npython = use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")\r\n\r\npython.toolchain(\r\n    name = \"python3_9\",\r\n    python_version = \"3.9\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nuse_repo(python, \"python3_9_toolchains\")\r\n\r\nregister_toolchains(\r\n    \"@python3_9_toolchains//:all\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE\r\n\r\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_python\",\r\n    sha256 =
