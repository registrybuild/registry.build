release upgrades dependencies, improves performance, and adds a few features.\r\n\r\n### Upgrades\r\n\r\n- `@com_google_javascript_closure_compiler` 2008-01-01 â†’ 2008-04-02\r\n- `@com_google_javascript_closure_library` 2017-12-03 â†’ 2018-04-05\r\n- `@com_google_template_soy` 2018-01-03 â†’ 2018-03-14\r\n- `@com_google_protobuf` 3.5.0 â†’ 3.5.1\r\n- `@com_google_guava` 21.0 â†’ 24.1-jre\r\n- `@com_google_auto_value` 1.4-rc2 â†’ 1.6\r\n- `@com_google_auto_factory` 1.0-beta3 â†’ 1.0-beta5\r\n- `@com_google_errorprone_error_prone_annotations` 2.0.19 â†’ 2.1.3\r\n- `@com_squareup_javawriter` 2.5.1 â†’ `@com_squareup_javapoet` 1.7.0\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- There's now a fine-grained build graph for the Closure Library. Read dea93c4667e95802a8511c873fb8504eb1cf5125 for details on how this can reduce footprints and build latencies. See also [//closure/library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/tree/master/closure/library) for the full catalog of build rules.\r\n\r\n- `deps.js` no longer needs to be an implicit dependency thanks to `transitionalforwarddeclarations.js`.\r\n\r\n- A `lenient` attribute is now available for `closure_js_library` which makes the compiler more easy-going.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- `goog.labs`, `goog.ui`, and third party APIs may no longer be exported from\r\n  `//closure/library` and `//closure/library:testing` by default.\r\n- Several breaking changes to the private `//closure/private:defs.bzl` Skylark API.\r\n\r\n### Workspace\r\n\r\n```py\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"io_bazel_rules_closure\",\r\n    sha256 =

Migrating to this release should be relatively painless. The only breaking change you may encounter is that some linter warnings are now being treated as errors, which can be easily suppressed.\n\n### New Features\n- Closure Compiler conformance protobuf configuration files are now supported thanks to @hochhaus in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/8fcdda12ad9e3f00179c58d7765f3d909ef31fd0. Please note that In the near future, Closure Rules will open source Google's internal conformance configs and make them the default.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- A nasty bug with CSS compilation has now been fixed thanks to @iflan and @hochhaus. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/a657ced5066a8d5281eb4f81bf5154b0b5d357e2 and https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/issues/129. \n- A soy file can now have two [closure_js_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_template_library) rules that compile it with and without Incremental DOM, without causing a naming error thanks to @hochhaus in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/55aaa4670e2dbb1720dc4b547b465fa5338fa680\n- Fixes to cross-repository support thanks to @hochhaus in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/c29b38ee3fe5ac263b85b0a51ee03c82ca5f19a3\n- [closure_js_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_template_library) should_generate_soy_msg_defs attribute now works thanks to @gramic in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/c37dc239e808a3ed90b37bd06af1bf094195f142\n\n### Breaking changes\n- All JsChecker warnings are now errors. If this breaks your build, please remember that the error message will contain a code you can add to the `suppress` attribute of [closure_js_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_library) to make it go away (if you'd prefer not to fix it.) We made this change because warnings are finicky; they don't show up when builds are cached, so they're sometimes hard to find again if they've already scrolled off the screen.\n- The incremental_dom library target was renamed `@io_bazel_rules_closure//third_party/javascript/incremental_dom` to improve compatibility with Google's internal repository in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/1ddf26e894cd859b13b0e7cdcec672fa532fe39c\n\n### Upgrades\n- Closure Compiler v20160822 â†’ v20161024 ([Release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Releases#october-24-2016-v20161024))\n  - Various compile time performance improvements to the optimization passes.\n  - Better support/fixes for `@abstract` classes and methods\n  - Polyfills for Promises.\n  - Support for async/await by transpiling to generators.\n- Closure Library v20160822 â†’ v20161024 (Release notes: [v20160911](https://github.com/google/closure-library/releases/tag/v20160911), [v20161024](https://github.com/google/closure-library/releases/tag/v20161024))\n- Closure Stylesheets 1.3.0 â†’ 1.4.0  ([Release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-stylesheets/releases/tag/v1.4.0))\n  - Fixes nasty bug where compiler crashes for stylesheets with commas\n- Protobuf 3.0.0-beta-3 â†’ 3.1.0\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/4055793","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/4055793/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/4055793/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/tag/0.3.0","id":4055793,"author":{"login":"jart","id":49262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart","html_url":"https://github.com/jart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQwNTU3OTM=","tag_name":"0.3.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Closure Rules v0.3.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-09-05T22:27:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T23:27:02Z","published_at":"2016-09-05T22:28:14Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/tarball/0.3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/zipball/0.3.0","body":"This release makes it possible to render type safe [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) inside HTML templates. You can now write services the same way Googlers do, with Protocol Buffers at all layers of the stack.\n\nProtocol Buffers are the most integral data structure at Google. BigTable stores protobufs. gRPC transmits protobufs over network between backends and frontends. Business logic operates on protobufs. HTML templates render protobufs. This eliminates entire categories of problems most developers would consider toil, such as turning SQL into objects into JSON/XML and back into objects.\n\nThis release also enables CSS sourcemaps and upgrades Closure to the latest version.\n\n## New Features\n- Protobuf types can be referenced in HTML templates by having [closure_js_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_template_library) depend on a [closure_js_proto_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_proto_library) rule. Support has not yet been added for [closure_java_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_java_template_library) yet. This work was made possible by @mikesamuel who put a lot of work into open sourcing this functionality. The integration was contributed by @hochhaus in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/1cae2870f435a78feb45d24f0626e118eda2d217 which includes tested examples of usage.\n- [closure_css_binary](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_css_binary) now generates a CSS sourcemap file thanks again to @mikesamuel and Closure Stylesheets maintainer @iflan. Integration in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/a2fed40f31e7fae9a9d531a15c21a3338da06801. Improvements still need to be made on paths outputted in sourcemap file.\n- Automatically enable `--assume_function_wrapper` optimization when `output_wrapper = \"(function(){%output%}).call(this);\"`. Contributed by @hochhaus in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/190f7d9b6d3608455ff404504bb3cda3aa7a3bc1\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Allow filesets in closure_js_proto_library. Contributed by @flamingcow66 in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/bd4049c884909c9ab5d2b67f674a77c3a26b2cf6\n\n## Breaking Changes\n- New Type Inference engine is now disabled by default. To re-enable it, pass `defs=[\"--new_type_inf\"]` to [closure_js_binary](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_binary). See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/commit/fedf10c319a93ae6e896d3b912affe4b23e05787.\n- The deprecated `closure_js_template_library` and `closure_java_template_library` aliases have been removed.\n- The `//closure/stylesheets` binary has been moved to `//third_party/java/csscomp:ClosureCommandLineCompiler`.\n\n## Upgrades\n- Closure Compiler v20160713 â†’ v20160822 ([release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Releases#august-22-2016-v20160822))\n  - Includes fixes making it easy to use goog.module w/ ES6 subclasses\n- Closure Library v20160713 â†’ v20160822 ([release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-library/releases/tag/v20160822))\n  - Includes breaking improvements to `goog.dom.TagName`\n- Closure Stylesheets 20160212 â†’ 1.3.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-stylesheets/releases/tag/v1.3.0))\n  - Sourcemap functionality fixed\n  - `@if` now usable inside blocks, including `@mixin`\n- Closure Templates 2016-07-21 â†’ 2016-07-25\n- Incremental DOM 0.4.0 â†’ 0.5.0\n- Safe HTML Types 1.0.4 â†’ 1.0.5\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3722273","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3722273/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3722273/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/tag/0.2.5","id":3722273,"author":{"login":"jart","id":49262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart","html_url":"https://github.com/jart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM3MjIyNzM=","tag_name":"0.2.5","target_commitish":"master","name":"Closure Rules v0.2.5","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-07-22T19:03:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T19:52:08Z","published_at":"2016-07-22T21:06:43Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/tarball/0.2.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/zipball/0.2.5","body":"This release upgrades upstream dependencies.\n- Closure Compiler v20160619 â†’ v20160713 ([release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Releases#july-13-2016-v20160713))\n  - Highlight: Some types of JS compilation may go faster\n- Closure Library v20160619 â†’ v20160713 ([release notes](https://github.com/google/closure-library/releases/tag/v20160713))\n  - Highlight: Added enum for HTML attributes: `goog.dom.Attr`\n- Closure Templates 2016-01-12 â†’ 2016-07-21\n  - Will now run in Java 7 environments, e.g. App Engine\n  - [Safe HTML Types](https://github.com/google/safe-html-types/blob/master/doc/safehtml-types.md) support: `@io_bazel_rules_closure//closure/templates:safe_html_types`\n  - Incremental DOM is now part of official Soy; `@incremental_dom_soy` is removed\n  - Improved error reporting\n  - New Java bytecode compiler: `@io_bazel_rules_closure//closure/templates:SoyToJbcSrcCompiler` Closure Rules does not use this, but might in the future.\n  - **Breaking Changes**\n    - Templates that take a boolean must actually take booleans. 0 and 1 will no longer work.\n    - Empty list/map dereference (`{let $a: [] /}{$a[0]}`) and iteration (`{foreach $a in []}`) is now a compilation error.\n    - `deprecated-noautoescape` has been removed. Learn how to upgrade your templates here: https://github.com/google/closure-templates/commit/a5f5acb7b0df2fd848c243acd32b61a72fc926b0\n    - Java users need to replace calls to `setActiveDelegatePackageNames(delegates)` with `setActiveDelegatePackageSelector(Predicates.in(delegates))`. See: https://github.com/google/closure-templates/commit/41b599e2c886d285841e20abc1f7503358c20e85\n    - Remove SoySauce.Renderer.setActiveDelpackageNames and replace it with .setActiveDelpackageSelector which takes a Predicate object.  Deprecate the analgous method on SoyTofu.\n    - Aliases in globals are now respected.  This probably won't break anything, unless your aliases conflict with your root globals namespaces.\n    - Users who are subtyping SoyModule directly will need to switch to subtyping AbstractModule and directly installing SoyModule instead.\n    - A backslash in Soy attribute value is now used for escaping the following backslash or double quote. It is preserved if followed by other characters. Most templates are unaffected by this change but some edge cases break: `{msg desc=\"abc\\\"}` was valid before but it is not now. `{msg desc=\"\\\\\"}` had value \\ before but it has `\\` now.\n    - Users who rely on deltemplates being generated into the js object named 'null' will break.  Though it is unlikely anyone relies on this.\n    - In the Soy Abstract Syntax Tree, SoyMsg now uses the SourceLocation class for source file information, which also includes line numbers.\n    - A new method has been added to the SoySauce interface.  This will break custom subclasses.\n    - All templates that use an `$ij` parameter named 'csp_nonce' will need to use a new variable.\n    - `{{command}}` syntax is no longer supported.  Braces are now supported in string literals, so there is no need for this syntax.  Use single braces.\n- gson 2.4 â†’ 2.7 (per soy change)\n- icu4j 56.1 â†’ 57.1 (per soy change)\n- json âˆ… â†’ 20160212 (per soy change)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3674237","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3674237/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3674237/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/tag/0.2.4","id":3674237,"author":{"login":"jart","id":49262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart","html_url":"https://github.com/jart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM2NzQyMzc=","tag_name":"0.2.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"Closure Rules v0.2.4","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-07-16T22:37:08Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T22:47:21Z","published_at":"2016-07-16T22:47:21Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/tarball/0.2.4","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/zipball/0.2.4","body":"This release contains some bug fixes and features that will be important for users running development web servers from Bazel, or generating deps files for raw sources mode.

If you want the old behavior, pass `compilation_level = \"WHITESPACE_ONLY\"` to your rule. Due to a [bug](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/pull/75#issuecomment-222035226), for the duration of the next few releases you'll need to add `/** @exports */` to your global test functions, or use `goog.testing.testSuite` (with quoted keys) to register them. If that's not appetizing, just use whitespace only mode until we can get automatic exporting of test functions straightened out.\n- JS binaries will now set `USE_NATIVE_JSON` by default. This means smaller binaries at the expense of breaking IE7 / IE6 support. If you need to support those browsers, then please file an issue and we'll add support for turning this off. (Contributed by @hochhaus)\n- Strict escaping is now 100% mandatory when using Closure Templates. (Contributed by @hochhaus)\n\n## Deprecations\n- closure_template_js_library has been renamed to [closure_js_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_template_library). The old name will be removed in the next release.\n- closure_template_java_library has been renamed to [closure_java_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_java_template_library). The old name will be removed in the next release.\n\n## New Features\n- New [closure_js_proto_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_proto_library) rule. (Contributed by @hochhaus)\n- Incremental DOM support for [closure_js_template_library](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_template_library). This allows templates to be rendered in such a way that it consumes less memory but more CPU. See this [mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/closure-rules-discuss/nzRHRVdNsI4) for more information. (Contributed by @hochhaus)\n- New `output_wrapper` flag for [closure_js_binary](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#closure_js_binary). (Contributed by @hochhaus)\n- New low-level [phantomjs_test](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure#phantomjs_test) rule.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- `STRICT_MODE_COMPATIBLE` is now defined if the language combination is strict.

Most of the missing features have been implemented. Most of the bugs have been hammered out.\n\nHowever Closure Rules should still be considered alpha because we're not yet ready to finalize its design. The definitions of rules may change; but if they do, we'll make note of that in the release.\n\n## New Features\n- `closure_js_library` now does syntax checking and linting. Therefore `closure_js_check_test` and `closure_js_lint_test` have been removed. The behavior of the linter can be controlled with the `suppress` flag. See the README.\n- JS rules can now depend on CSS rules for class name minification. When a JS binary is produced, it will reconcile its transitive closure with that of the CSS binary to pinpoint errors. However `goog.getCssName()` calls are not yet validated by the linter; that comes in the next release.\n- New `entry_points` attribute for `closure_js_binary`.\n- Ability to omit dependencies in `closure_repositories()`\n- Closure Library base.js is now a dependency of all `closure_js_library` rules by default. Use the `no_closure_library` flag to disable this.\n- CSS orientation flipping with graph validation.\n- `closure_js_binary` rules can now be referenced as though they're `closure_js_library` rules.\n- `closure_css_binary` rules can now be referenced as though they're `closure_css_library` rules.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- ES6 modules now work.\n- `closure_js_deps` now works. It now only produces the deps-runfiles.js type of output, which is now just called deps.js.\n- The `exports` attribute now works.\n- Most bugs referencing from an external repository have been ironed out. If you see an error running `depswriter.py` then just add `workspace(name=\"foo\")` to the top of your `WORKSPACE` file.\n\n## Upstream Versions\n- Closure Compiler v20160315\n- Closure Library v20160315\n- Closure Stylesheets 20160212\n- Closure Templates 2016-01-12\n- PhantomJS 2.1.1\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3145183","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3145183/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/3145183/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/releases/tag/0.0.2","id":3145183,"author":{"login":"jart","id":49262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart","html_url":"https://github.com/jart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTMxNDUxODM=","tag_name":"0.0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"Closure Rules v0.0.2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2016-05-03T03:41:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T03:53:46Z","published_at":"2016-05-03T03:50:31Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/tarball/0.0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_closure/zipball/0.0.2","body":"This release fixes launch blockers #9 and #19.
