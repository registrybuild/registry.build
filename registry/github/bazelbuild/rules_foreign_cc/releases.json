Users should update their load statements to use the new paths. #555 #557\r\n- Toolchain definitions are now located in `toolchains`. #541\r\n- The `cmake_external` rule has been renamed to `cmake`. #539\r\n- A new `targets` attribute was added to the `cmake`, `configure_make`, and `make` rules. This should be used over `make_commands` for building targets. #556\r\n- The `make` rule no longer passes the `PREFIX` argument as part of the default build command. #556\r\n- The `keep_going` attribute (previously defaulted to `True`) is deprecated, users can maintain this behavior by passing `-k` themselves. #556\r\n- Logs from built tools are now written to a file and only printed to the terminal when the target fails to build. #559\r\n- Output attributes on common rules have been renamed from `*_libraries` to `out_*_libs`. #538 \r\n- Downloaded CMake tools should now work on docker-sandbox / RBE #545 \r\n- The min supported version is raised from `3.4.0` to `3.7.0`. #561\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The built make tool doesn't work on RBE."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/releases/39074569","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/releases/39074569/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/releases/39074569/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/releases/tag/0.1.0","id":39074569,"author":{"login":"jsharpe","id":11253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe","html_url":"https://github.com/jsharpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsharpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM5MDc0NTY5","tag_name":"0.1.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"0.1.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-03-01T22:41:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T01:51:01Z","published_at":"2021-03-01T23:01:16Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/tarball/0.1.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_foreign_cc/zipball/0.1.0","body":"# 0.1.0\r\n\r\nhttps://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_foreign_cc/0.1.0/\r\n\r\nNote this will be the last release to be tested on Bazel **3.4.0**. All releases going forward will be tested on **4.0.0**.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n```python\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_foreign_cc\",\r\n    sha256 = \"c2cdcf55ffaf49366725639e45dedd449b8c3fe22b54e31625eb80ce3a240f1e\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_foreign_cc-0.1.0\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/archive/0.1.0.zip\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_foreign_cc//:workspace_definitions.bzl\", \"rules_foreign_cc_dependencies\")\r\n\r\n# This sets up some common toolchains for building targets. For more details, please see\r\n# https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_foreign_cc/0.1.0/#rules_foreign_cc_dependencies\r\nrules_foreign_cc_dependencies()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this release will default to using a downloaded version of cmake and ninja. If you want to revert to the previous behaviour of using the host installed version call use `rules_foreign_cc_dependencies(register_default_tools = False)` in your `WORKSPACE` file. The use of the host installed tools can be disabled using the `register_preinstalled_tools` argument.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n- Added repository rules for downloading prebuilt versions of cmake and ninja rather than relying on system installed tools.\r\n\r\n- Added native ninja build rule\r\n\r\n- Now builds under the bazel sandbox rather than in /tmp\r\n\r\n- Tidied up the structure of the examples directory\r\n\r\n- Deprecated the old rules install_ws_dependency and cc_configure_make\r\n\r\n- Autogenerated documentation was added\r\n"}]
