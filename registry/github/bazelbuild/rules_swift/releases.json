What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `swift_module=` tag on `cc_library` targets no longer does anything, and the `swift_c_module` rule was removed: #1191 and #1224\r\n  * Use the new `swift_interop_hint` aspect hint instead\r\n  * There were also some changes to how the `apple_common.Objc` provider is handled (e.g. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/commit/d68b21471e4e9d922b75e2b0621082b8ce017d11)\r\n* The deprecated swift proto library rules were removed: #1193\r\n* The Bzlmod `module.compatibility_level` was increased: #1214\r\n  * If you ruleset can support both pre-2.0 and post-2.0 **rules_swift**, please set `bazel_dep.max_compatibility_level = 2` instead of bumping your minimum supported version of **rules_swift**\r\n* The `swift.disable_system_index` feature is now enabled by default: #1252\r\n* Removed `swift.emit_symbol_graph` feature: #1229\r\n  * Use the new `swift_symbol_graph_extract` rule\r\n* Removed the `swift.use_response_files` feature: #1275\r\n* Removed the `swift.bundled_xctests` feature: #1272\r\n* Removed the implicit output from swift_library: #1260\r\n* Moved `swift_usage_aspect` and `SwiftUsageInfo` from **rules_swift** into **rules_apple**: #1223\r\n* Manually specifying the `-index-store-path` flag while also using the `swift.index_while_building` is no longer supported: #1248\r\n* It is now an error to specify both `swiftinterface` and `swiftmodule` in `swift_import`: #1253\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Moved rules and other build definitions into their own public files and deprecated the umbrella `swift.bzl` and `proto.bzl` files: #1231, #1236, and #1255\r\n  * Please update your `load` statements as the `swift.bzl` file will be removed in the next major release\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n* Added support for symbol graph extraction with the `swift_symbol_graph_extract` rule: #772, #1195, #1246, #1270, and #1271\r\n* Added support for the `fdo_instrument_order_file` feature: #1251\r\n* Added the `swift.add_target_name_to_output` feature, which allows multiple targets in a package to produce the same module name in the same build: #1098 and #1217\r\n* Added the `swift.thin_lto` and `swift.full_lto` features to enable LTO: #1208\r\n* Added the `swift.propagate_generated_module_map` feature to propagate the generated module map: #1212\r\n* Added the `swift.headers_always_action_inputs` feature which causes all headers to always be included as inputs to `SwiftCompile` actions, even when using explicit modules: #1249\r\n* Added an API to compile a `.swiftinterface` file into a `.swiftmodule`: #1250\r\n* Added an XCTest observer to `swift_test` targets that generates a JUnit-style XML log at the path in the `XML_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable defined by Bazel: #1222, #1242, #1263, and #1273\r\n* Added a `discover_tests` attribute to `swift_test`: #1259, #1266, #1273, and #1274\r\n* Added a mechanism to provide a list of protocol names for constant value extraction: #1170\r\n* Added a `swift_common.get_toolchain` helper function: #1226, #1257, and #1258\r\n* `resource_set` is now defined for `SwiftCompile` actions: #1241\r\n* Swift compiler sandboxing is now disabled when using Xcode 15.3+, which fixes nested sandboxing errors: #1206\r\n* We now correctly add `.swiftmodule` directories to the search path: #1245\r\n* We now correctly calculate the minimum supported OS when calculating the target triple for 'arm64-apple-ios<version>-simulator' targets: #1247\r\n* The new driver is now used on Xcode 14+ since it contains the fixes in https://github.com/apple/swift-driver/pull/1036: #1268\r\n* Removed some no-longer-relevant \"supports X\" features: #1267\r\n* Fixed LLDB expr evaluation for `swift_{binary,test}` targets only containing Swift in their `srcs`: #1269\r\n* Fixed usage of params files in `_swift_proto_compile`: #1283\r\n\r\nThis release is compatible with Bazel 6.x LTS, 7.x LTS, and 8.x rolling releases.\r\n\r\n## MODULE.bazel Snippet\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_swift\", version = \"2.0.0\", repo_name =

What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `swift_module=` tag on `cc_library` targets no longer does anything, and the `swift_c_module` rule was removed: #1191 and #1224\r\n  * Use the new `swift_interop_hint` aspect hint instead\r\n  * There were also some changes to how the `apple_common.Objc` provider is handled (e.g. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/commit/d68b21471e4e9d922b75e2b0621082b8ce017d11)\r\n* The deprecated swift proto library rules were removed: #1193\r\n* The Bzlmod `module.compatibility_level` was increased: #1214\r\n  * If you ruleset can support both pre-2.0 and post-2.0 **rules_swift**, please set `bazel_dep.max_compatibility_level = 2` instead of bumping your minimum supported version of **rules_swift**\r\n* The `swift.disable_system_index` feature is now enabled by default: #1252\r\n* Removed `swift.emit_symbol_graph` feature: #1229\r\n  * Use the new `swift_symbol_graph_extract` rule\r\n* Removed the `swift.use_response_files` feature: #1275\r\n* Removed the `swift.bundled_xctests` feature: #1272\r\n* Removed the implicit output from swift_library: #1260\r\n* Moved `swift_usage_aspect` and `SwiftUsageInfo` from **rules_swift** into **rules_apple**: #1223\r\n* Manually specifying the `-index-store-path` flag while also using the `swift.index_while_building` is no longer supported: #1248\r\n* It is now an error to specify both `swiftinterface` and `swiftmodule` in `swift_import`: #1253\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Moved rules and other build definitions into their own public files and deprecated the umbrella `swift.bzl` and `proto.bzl` files: #1231, #1236, and #1255\r\n  * Please update your `load` statements as the `swift.bzl` file will be removed in the next major release\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n* Added support for symbol graph extraction with the `swift_symbol_graph_extract` rule: #772, #1195, #1246, #1270, and #1271\r\n* Added support for the `fdo_instrument_order_file` feature: #1251\r\n* Added the `swift.add_target_name_to_output` feature, which allows multiple targets in a package to produce the same module name in the same build: #1098 and #1217\r\n* Added the `swift.thin_lto` and `swift.full_lto` features to enable LTO: #1208\r\n* Added the `swift.propagate_generated_module_map` feature to propagate the generated module map: #1212\r\n* Added the `swift.headers_always_action_inputs` feature which causes all headers to always be included as inputs to `SwiftCompile` actions, even when using explicit modules: #1249\r\n* Added an API to compile a `.swiftinterface` file into a `.swiftmodule`: #1250\r\n* Added an XCTest observer to `swift_test` targets that generates a JUnit-style XML log at the path in the `XML_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable defined by Bazel: #1222, #1242, #1263, and #1273\r\n* Added a `discover_tests` attribute to `swift_test`: #1259, #1266, #1273, and #1274\r\n* Added a mechanism to provide a list of protocol names for constant value extraction: #1170\r\n* Added a `swift_common.get_toolchain` helper function: #1226, #1257, and #1258\r\n* `resource_set` is now defined for `SwiftCompile` actions: #1241\r\n* Swift compiler sandboxing is now disabled when using Xcode 15.3+, which fixes nested sandboxing errors: #1206\r\n* We now correctly add `.swiftmodule` directories to the search path: #1245\r\n* We now correctly calculate the minimum supported OS when calculating the target triple for 'arm64-apple-ios<version>-simulator' targets: #1247\r\n* The new driver is now used on Xcode 14+ since it contains the fixes in https://github.com/apple/swift-driver/pull/1036: #1268\r\n* Removed some no-longer-relevant \"supports X\" features: #1267\r\n* Fixed LLDB expr evaluation for `swift_{binary,test}` targets only containing Swift in their `srcs`: #1269\r\n\r\nThis release is compatible with Bazel 6.x LTS, 7.x LTS, and 8.x rolling releases.\r\n\r\n## MODULE.bazel Snippet\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_swift\", version = \"2.0.0-rc1\", repo_name = \"build_bazel_rules_swift\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Workspace
