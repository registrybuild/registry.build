Potentially breaking changes\r\n\r\n- A `platform_mappings` file is now required in some cases. If you do not already have one you can copy [rules_apple's](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/platform_mappings)\r\n- Test targets now require `minimum_os_version` (#2124)\r\n- Adds target name to bundle output paths when `bundle_name` differs from `name`. This allows having targets with the same `bundle_name` in the same `BUILD` file, thanks @chiragramani!\r\n- Replaced `apple_common.multi_arch_split` with new transition, this should not be a breaking change but is required for bazel 7.x support. Please file any issues you find!\r\n- Removes any support for Xcode prior to 14 from the rules, matching the supported versions from the App Store\r\n- Imported versioned (macOS) frameworks need to be the correct format (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/placing_content_in_a_bundle), and currently don't support `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:use_tree_artifacts_outputs`/`--define=apple.experimental.tree_artifact_outputs=1`\r\n\r\n## Notable additions\r\n\r\n- Add support for app intents through the `app_intents` attribute\r\n- Add ExtensionKit support to `ios_extension`, `macos_extension`, and `tvos_extension` rules\r\n- Add rpaths to `apple_xcframework` generated binaries\r\n- Add support for watchOS single target applications, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Adding Support for UI Test Coverage, thanks @gabijarciskeviciute and @mattrobmattrob!\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements\r\n\r\n- Include `private_deps` when gathering resources for Apple rules\r\n- Include Apple Symbols for watchOS extensions, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Document Xcode version selection and invalidation strategy, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Improve exception message catching when running tests, thanks @sebastianv1!\r\n- Embed frameworks in `ios_message_extension`, thanks @brentleyjones!\r\n\r\n## Migrations\r\n\r\n- `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:use_tree_artifacts_outputs` should be used instead of `--define=apple.experimental.tree_artifact_outputs=1`. Support for the define will be removed in the future.\r\n- `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:signing_certificate_name` should be used instead of `--ios_signing_cert_name`\r\n\r\nThis
