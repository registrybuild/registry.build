`env = [\"$SOME_OTHER_VAR\"]` you will now need to use `env = [\"$$SOME_OTHER_VAR\"]`   \r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n\r\n* Added support for the `--hosting-base-path` argument to `docc_archive`: #2455\r\n* Added support for bundling dylib deps from `CcInfo`: #2473\r\n* Added support for both pre-2.0 and post-2.0 **rules_swift** when using Blzmod: #2480\r\n* Changed `.xctestrun` key `BAZEL_TEST_PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME`: #2454\r\n* Updated `docc_archive` to support `deps` and `data`: #2450\r\n* You can now nest `.app` bundles when using tree artifacts: #2449\r\n* Fixed broken URL for platforms repo version 0.0.9: #2452\r\n* Fixed provider type checking for `AppleDynamicFrameworkProvider` migration: #2453\r\n\r\nThis release is compatible with Bazel 6.x LTS, 7.x LTS, and 8.x
