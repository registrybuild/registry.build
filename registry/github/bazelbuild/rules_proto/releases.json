This allows you to choose where the protobuf compiler (`protoc`) comes from, as well as configure a toolchain for each language you generate proto stubs for.\r\n\r\nThis de-couples rules_proto from the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf repository; `rules_proto` no longer depends on `com_google_protobuf`. The Bazel rules in that repository are now maintained by the protobuf team for Google use cases, and may diverge from rules_proto over time.\r\n\r\nrules_proto does not include the toolchain implementation. See https://registry.bazel.build/modules/toolchains_protoc for an example module that registers the prebuilt binary from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.\r\n\r\nThe tracking issue for this feature is #179\r\n\r\n# BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\nUpgrading from rules_proto 5.x requires some changes:\r\n\r\n- The `load` site for `rules_proto_toolchains` has changed. See the new WORKSPACE snippet below.\r\n- As mentioned above, rules_proto no longer depends on the protobuf repo (commonly as `com_google_protobuf`). As a result, the `rules_proto_dependencies` macro no longer fetches one. For WORKSPACE users, this may affect what version of protobuf you end up with. We recommend explicitly fetching `com_google_protobuf` early in the WORKSPACE file, as the first declaration wins.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\r\n\r\n1. [Bazel 6] Add `common --enable_bzlmod` to `.bazelrc`.\r\n\r\n2.

NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\nWhen used with Bazel 7, [Protobuf Toolchainization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CE6wJHNfKbUPBr7-mmk_0Yo3a4TaqcTPE0OWNuQkhPs/edit) is now available. This allows you to choose where the protobuf compiler (`protoc`) comes from, as well as configure a toolchain for each language you generate proto stubs for.\r\n\r\nThis de-couples rules_proto from the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf repository; `rules_proto` no longer depends on `com_google_protobuf`. The Bazel rules in that repository are now maintained by the protobuf team for Google use cases, and may diverge from rules_proto over time.\r\n\r\nrules_proto does not include the toolchain implementation. See https://registry.bazel.build/modules/toolchains_protoc for an example module that registers the prebuilt binary from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.\r\n\r\nThe tracking issue for this feature is #179\r\n\r\n# BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\nUpgrading from rules_proto 5.x requires some changes:\r\n\r\n- The `load` site for `rules_proto_toolchains` has changed. See the new WORKSPACE snippet below.\r\n- As mentioned above, rules_proto no longer depends on the protobuf repo (commonly as `com_google_protobuf`). As a result, the `rules_proto_dependencies` macro no longer fetches one. For WORKSPACE users, this may affect what version of protobuf you end up with. We recommend explicitly fetching `com_google_protobuf` early in the WORKSPACE file, as the first declaration wins.\r\n\r\n## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\r\n\r\n1. [Bazel 6] Add `common --enable_bzlmod` to `.bazelrc`.\r\n\r\n2. Add to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_proto\", version = \"6.0.0-rc3\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_proto\",\r\n    sha256 = \"a88d018bdcb8df1ce8185470eb4b4899d778f9ac3a66cb36d514beb81e345282\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_proto-6.0.0-rc3\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/download/6.0.0-rc3/rules_proto-6.0.0-rc3.tar.gz\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_proto//proto:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_proto_dependencies\")\r\nrules_proto_dependencies()\r\n\r\nload(\"@rules_proto//proto:toolchains.bzl\", \"rules_proto_toolchains\")\r\nrules_proto_toolchains()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix: add bazel versions tested to presubmit by @thesayyn in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/pull/202\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/compare/6.0.0-rc2...6.0.0-rc3","mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/139719800","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/139719800/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/139719800/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/tag/6.0.0-rc2","id":139719800,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOC72rW84IU_R4","tag_name":"6.0.0-rc2","target_commitish":"main","name":"6.0.0-rc2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-01-16T08:43:09Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T19:18:34Z","published_at":"2024-02-02T19:18:34Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/assets/149456204","id":149456204,"node_id":"RA_kwDOC72rW84I6IVM","name":"rules_proto-6.0.0-rc2.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":28085,"digest":null,"download_count":257560,"created_at":"2024-02-02T19:18:34Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T19:18:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/releases/download/6.0.0-rc2/rules_proto-6.0.0-rc2.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/tarball/6.0.0-rc2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_proto/zipball/6.0.0-rc2","body":"## Using bzlmod with Bazel 6 or later:\n\n1.
