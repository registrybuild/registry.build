[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n_**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated and cleaned up.**_\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc6 (2026-01-15)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `attr.label_list_dict` type accepts a dict in which keys are strings and values are lists of labels. (#27550)\r\n+ The new `package_relative_label` function on the rule context (`ctx`) can be used to turn a user-provided label string into a `Label` relative to the target that is currently being analyzed (where `Label(...)` would return a `Label` relative to the `.bzl` file containing the call). (#28185)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ In environment variable values set via `--repo_env`, the substring `%bazel_workspace%` is now replaced with the absolute path of the current Bazel workspace. This can, for example, be used to make tools checked into the repository available on the `PATH` for repository rules. (#27562)\r\n+ `--override_repository` now supports apparent repository names from the point of view of the main repository. An unknown apparent repo name will result in an error. (#27898)\r\n+ The values of keyword arguments passed to `use_repo` can now contain the special substrings `{name}` and `{version}`, which are treated as equivalent to the corresponding attributes of the current module. (#28016)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27558)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n_**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated and cleaned up.**_\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc5 (2026-01-13)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `attr.label_list_dict` type accepts a dict in which keys are strings and values are lists of labels. (#27550)\r\n+ The new `package_relative_label` function on the rule context (`ctx`) can be used to turn a user-provided label string into a `Label` relative to the target that is currently being analyzed (where `Label(...)` would return a `Label` relative to the `.bzl` file containing the call). (#28185)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ In environment variable values set via `--repo_env`, the substring `%bazel_workspace%` is now replaced with the absolute path of the current Bazel workspace. This can, for example, be used to make tools checked into the repository available on the `PATH` for repository rules. (#27562)\r\n+ `--override_repository` now supports apparent repository names from the point of view of the main repository. An unknown apparent repo name will result in an error. (#27898)\r\n+ The values of keyword arguments passed to `use_repo` can now contain the special substrings `{name}` and `{version}`, which are treated as equivalent to the corresponding attributes of the current module. (#28016)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27558)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n_**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated and cleaned up.**_\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc4 (2026-01-13)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `attr.label_list_dict` type accepts a dict in which keys are strings and values are lists of labels. (#27550)\r\n+ The new `package_relative_label` function on the rule context (`ctx`) can be used to turn a user-provided label string into a `Label` relative to the target that is currently being analyzed (where `Label(...)` would return a `Label` relative to the `.bzl` file containing the call). (#28185)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ In environment variable values set via `--repo_env`, the substring `%bazel_workspace%` is now replaced with the absolute path of the current Bazel workspace. This can, for example, be used to make tools checked into the repository available on the `PATH` for repository rules. (#27562)\r\n+ `--override_repository` now supports apparent repository names from the point of view of the main repository. An unknown apparent repo name will result in an error. (#27898)\r\n+ The values of keyword arguments passed to `use_repo` can now contain the special substrings `{name}` and `{version}`, which are treated as equivalent to the corresponding attributes of the current module. (#28016)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27558)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.5.0 (2025-12-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.5.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired. ([#27429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27429))\r\n* The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels). ([#27417](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27417))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27128](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27128))\r\n* The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`. ([#27531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27531))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place. ([#27296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27296))\r\n* git_repository and new_git_repository now check out the default branch of a git repository if no branch, tag or revision are specified, the repo's default branch will be checked out ([#27705](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27705)).\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo. ([#27117](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27117))\r\n* bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression ([#27560](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27560))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.5.0rc4 (2025-12-09)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.5.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired. ([#27429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27429))\r\n* The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels). ([#27417](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27417))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27128](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27128))\r\n* The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`. ([#27531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27531))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place. ([#27296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27296))\r\n* git_repository and new_git_repository now check out the default branch of a git repository if no branch, tag or revision are specified, the repo's default branch will be checked out ([#27705](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27705)).\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo. ([#27117](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27117))\r\n* bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression ([#27560](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27560))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.5.0rc3 (2025-12-09)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.5.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired. ([#27429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27429))\r\n* The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels). ([#27417](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27417))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27128](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27128))\r\n* The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`. ([#27531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27531))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place. ([#27296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27296))\r\n* git_repository and new_git_repository now check out the default branch of a git repository if no branch, tag or revision are specified, the repo's default branch will be checked out ([#27705](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27705)).\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo. ([#27117](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27117))\r\n* bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression ([#27560](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27560))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n_**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated and cleaned up.**_\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc3 (2025-11-24)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `attr.label_list_dict` type accepts a dict in which keys are strings and values are lists of labels. (#27550)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ In environment variable values set via `--repo_env`, the substring `%bazel_workspace%` is now replaced with the absolute path of the current Bazel workspace. This can, for example, be used to make tools checked into the repository available on the `PATH` for repository rules. (#27562)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27558)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior. (#27553)\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Sky, Adin Cebic, Adrian Vogelsgesang, Agustin Mista, Alan Mond, Alberto Cavalcante, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Fax, Alexander Golovlev, Ankush Chudiwal, Austin Schuh, bazel.build machine account, Benjamin Peterson, Benji Vos, Benson Muite, Bo Zhang, Boleyn Su, Bradley Bridges, Chi Wang, Chris Sauer, Christian Scott, Christopher Rydell, Chuck Grindel, Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, DeeperMind, dependabot[bot], Dimi Shahbaz, Dmitry Ivankov, Dmitry Ryabkov, Ed Schouten, Eric Riff, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Greg, Grzegorz Lukasik, Han-Wen Nienhuys, helly25, Honnix, hvd, Ian Stapleton Cordasco, jacqueline.lee, Jaden Peterson, James Jenkins, James Judd, Javier Maestro, Jay Conrod, Jim Carroll, jjudd, John Millikin, Jon Shea, Jonathan Schear, Jonathan Woodbury, Jordan Mele, kalvdans, Keith Lea, Keith Smiley, Kevin Bernal, Kiron, kxxt, Lev Leontev, Lszl Csomor, Lucas Loffel, Luis Padron, Marcus Eagan, Mark Reuter, Markus Hofbauer, Matt Brown, Matt Smith, Mike Lundy, Mislav Mandaric, Nathan Naze, nialdaly, Pareesh Madan, Pelikan.B, Peter Li, Peter Lukacs, Philipp Stephani, Pieter Agten, PikachuHy, Rgis Desgroppes, Ricard Sol, Richard Woodbury, Roman Salvador, Rostislav Rumenov, Ruoyu Zhong, Ryan Matthews, Sara Adams, sarad, Simon Thornington, Siva Mahadevan, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, Stephan Pleines, Steve Barrau, Taylor Barrella, tfrench, Thi Don, Timothy Gu, Tobias Werth, Tomasz Pasternak, Torgil Svensson, Ulrik Falklof, Valentin Grigorev, Vy Hong, Wade Carpenter, Will Stranton, Wojciech Mazur, Xdng Yng, xndcn, Xudong Yang, Yannic, Yannic Bonenberger, Zachary Kipping, Zhongpeng Lin.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with\r\nClasspath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.5.0rc2 (2025-11-14)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.5.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired. ([#27429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27429))\r\n* The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels). ([#27417](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27417))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27128](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27128))\r\n* The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`. ([#27531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27531))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place. ([#27296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27296))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo. ([#27117](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27117))\r\n* bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression ([#27560](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27560))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.5.0rc1 (2025-11-13)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. (#27128)\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`. (#27531)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place. (#27296)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired. (#27429)\r\n\r\nOSS:\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels). (#27417)\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo. (#27117)\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27560)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior. (#27564)\r\n\r\nRules-CPP:\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Bazel releases that include a bundled JDK now use the system trust store for certificates by default. Set `-Djavax....

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc2 (2025-11-11)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  72afe97fe8780c216fe1d9e89e52d78f0d73997e\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\nConfigurability:\r\n+ The new `attr.label_list_dict` type accepts a dict in which keys are strings and values are lists of labels. (#27550)\r\n\r\nExternalDeps:\r\n+ In environment variable values set via `--repo_env`, the substring `%bazel_workspace%` is now replaced with the absolute path of the current Bazel workspace. This can, for example, be used to make tools checked into the repository available on the `PATH` for repository rules. (#27562)\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n+ bazel query/cquery/aquery now supports an `executables()` function to find only the executable targets in a given expression (#27558)\r\n\r\nRemote-Exec:\r\n+ The new `--remote_max_concurrency_per_connection` can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent gRPC requests Bazel will issue on a single connection to the server. The default value of 100 matches the previous behavior. (#27553)\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Sky, Adin Cebic, Adrian Vogelsgesang, Agustin Mista, Alan Mond, Alberto Cavalcante, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Fax, Alexander Golovlev, Ankush Chudiwal, Austin Schuh, bazel.build machine account, Benjamin Peterson, Benji Vos, Benson Muite, Bo Zhang, Boleyn Su, Bradley Bridges, Chi Wang, Chris Sauer, Christian Scott, Christopher Rydell, Chuck Grindel, Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, DeeperMind, dependabot[bot], Dimi Shahbaz, Dmitry Ivankov, Dmitry Ryabkov, Ed Schouten, Eric Riff, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Greg, Grzegorz Lukasik, Han-Wen Nienhuys, helly25, Honnix, hvd, Ian Stapleton Cordasco, jacqueline.lee, Jaden Peterson, James Jenkins, James Judd, Javier Maestro, Jay Conrod, Jim Carroll, jjudd, John Millikin, Jon Shea, Jonathan Schear, Jonathan Woodbury, Jordan Mele, kalvdans, Keith Lea, Keith Smiley, Kevin Bernal, Kiron, kxxt, Lev Leontev, Lszl Csomor, Lucas Loffel, Luis Padron, Marcus Eagan, Mark Reuter, Markus Hofbauer, Matt Brown, Matt Smith, Mike Lundy, Mislav Mandaric, Nathan Naze, nialdaly, Pareesh Madan, Pelikan.B, Peter Li, Peter Lukacs, Philipp Stephani, PikachuHy, Ricard Sol, Richard Woodbury, Roman Salvador, Rostislav Rumenov, Ruoyu Zhong, Ryan Matthews, Sara Adams, sarad, Simon Thornington, Siva Mahadevan, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, Stephan Pleines, Steve Barrau, Taylor Barrella, tfrench, Thi Don, Timothy Gu, Tobias Werth, Tomasz Pasternak, Torgil Svensson, Ulrik Falklof, Valentin Grigorev, Vy Hong, Wade Carpenter, Will Stranton, Wojciech Mazur, Xdng Yng, xndcn, Xudong Yang, Yannic, Yannic Bonenberger, Zachary Kipping, Zhongpeng Lin.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 9.0.0rc1 (2025-11-03)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  72afe97fe8780c216fe1d9e89e52d78f0d73997e\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ The Python six library is no longer part of @external_tools.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility.\r\n+ A no-config transition is now available as `config.no_config()`.\r\n+ Actions that create runfiles trees are now considered regular actions. This means that they are now reported in statistics, critical paths and the like.\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--watchfs` startup option is now a no-op and will be removed in April 2025. Use the `--watchfs` command option instead.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic.\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate.\r\n+ Commands executed by \"bazel run\" now have two extra environment variables: $BUILD_ID indicates the id of the Bazel command and $BUILD_EXECROOT indicates the execroot of the Bazel server.\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module.\r\n+ Add a set data type to Starlark, guarded by the --experimental_enable_starlark_set flag.\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it.\r\n+ Changing any part of `--run_under` that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Changing --test_env no longer invalidates the analysis cache. `ctx.configuration.test_env` may be empty for non-test rules and should not be used by such rules.\r\n+ The progress of completed configured aspects is now shown in the UI, next to the number of completed targets. Example: \"(100 packages loaded, 10000 targets and 500 aspects configured)\".\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`.\r\n+ Fixed an issue where `genquery` in external repos would evaluate labels as if they were in the main repo.\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The legacy `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:maven_rules.bzl` rule for downloading Maven artifacts has been deleted. Consider migrating to rules_jvm_external if you are using this rule.\r\n+ Fix starlark_doc_extract proto output for symbolic macro visibility, attribute inheritance, and rule finalizers; and remove non-existent \"name\" attribute from starlark_doc_extract output for aspects.\r\n+ Java tests are no longer run with a `SecurityManager` that prevents `System.exit`, since `SecurityManager` functionality is being removed from the JDK.\r\n+ Baseline coverage files are no longer ignored.\r\n+ select() on `cpu`, `host_cpu`, or `crosstool_top now emits a \"deprecated flag\" warning\r\n+ `--max_idle_secs` now takes system sleep time into account when deciding when to shutdown the blaze server.\r\n+ Flip --experimental_enable_starlark_set and enable the Starlark set data type by default.\r\n+ Materializer functions now have access to the label of the rule they are running on as ctx.label .\r\n+ Extra targets provided to `ctx.expand_location` now expand to their executable (if any) instead of resulting in an error if they provide a number of files different from one. **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ On Linux, the default limit on the number of `--watchfs` file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`.\r\n+ Add a definition of the pacakge_metadata attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_locations_prefers_executable` flag has been added and enabled, which makes it so that `ctx.expand_location` expands `$(locations :x)` to the executable of an extra target `:x` if it provides one and the number of files provided by it is not one.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--enable_bzlmod` and `--enable_workspace` flags are now no-ops. Bzlmod is now always enabled, and WORKSPACE is always disabled.\r\n+ The new exec_group_compatible_with attribute on all rules accepts a dictionary mapping exec group names to lists of additional constraints to request from the exec group's execution platform.\r\n+ Removes the `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` flag.  The functionality this was intended for was never completed, and is no longer needed.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Constraints and toolchain requirements added to the default exec group, for example via the toolchains parameter of the rule function or the exec_compatible_with attribute on all rules, no longer apply to the test exec group, which contains the test action on test rules. Instead, use exec_group_compatible_with to apply constraints and/or define an explicit test exec group with toolchain requirements on test rules that require it.\r\n+ Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site.\r\n+ The new `no_match_error` attribute on `toolchain_type` can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required.\r\n+ Adds `ctx.rule.var` to allow aspects to get rule-specific variables, and removes rule-specific variables from an aspect's `ctx.var` dict.\r\n+ LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The canonical names of repos created with `use_repo_rule` have changed, which may require updating command-line flags such as `--override_repository`.\r\n+ Add `no_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type cannot be found for that platform.\r\n+ Flag `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` is deleted.\r\n+ None:\r\n+ The new `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` flag can be used to have test actions select an execution platform that has all the constraints provided by the target platform instead of always selecting the first available execution platform. This supersedes the `--use_target_platform_for_tests` flag.\r\n+ `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used.\r\n+ The `config` command now reports which configurations have had the test configuration trimmed.\r\n+ Stop documenting the vestigial `distribs` attribute.\r\n+ Turn the `distribs` common attribute into a no-op. See #19369\r\n+ Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro.\r\n+ Soft deprecate bazel startup option --write_command_log. User should switch to use command option with the same name or look at the build event messages.\r\n+ Add better defaults for mobile-install flags\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** struct providers are not supported in aspects\r\n+ The (deprecated) `output_licenses` attribute is now a string list rather than an internal data type. The only visible change may be that some query output may change from printing capitalized values of inputs will now show lower case.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** When remote execution fails and an action is executed locally, modifications of its inputs during execution are now checked according to the value of the `--guard_against_concurrent_changes` flag rather than as if that flag was set to `full`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** accessing struct providers is not supported anymore\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--verbose_explanations` flag is now a no-op: the additional information it produced wasn't useful enough to justify the memory cost of the additional bookkeeping.\r\n+ User-provided repo names may now start with a number.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ Added `--verbose_visibility_errors` for printing more information when a visibility violation occurs.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark computation step limits are now enforced for symbolic macros.\r\n+ Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Baseline coverage files for individual tests are no longer announced in the BES. Instead, a new `baseline_report.lcov` file containing the merged baseline coverage information for the entire invocation is now announced in the BES. It is also still merged into the combined report.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `watchfs` startup option has been removed.\r\n+ File change checks for non-output, non-repo external files can now be disabled with the `--experimental_check_external_other_files` flag.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `bazel sync` command has been removed. Use `bazel fetch --all` instead.\r\n+ java_import.jars attributes can no longer be empty, and --noincompatible_disallow_java_import_empty_jars is no longer supported\r\n+ The `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` flag is flipped and graveyarded. The `local_config_platform` builtin module has been removed.\r\n+ The `--experimental_split_xml_postprocessing` flag no longer exists.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** strings in attribute's \"provides\" parameters are no longer supported\r\n+ Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set.\r\n+ Singlejar can exclude certain entries\r\n+ Rules can now register their own baseline coverage files in LCOV format via the new `baseline_coverage_files` parameter of `ctx.instrumented_files_info`. If the target matches the instrumentation filter, Bazel will merge the data into the combined coverage report generated with `--combined_report`.\r\n+ `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--combined_report` now defaults to `lcov` (was: `none`).\r\n+ Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compat format when necessary.\r\n+ Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation.\r\n+ `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` is removed.\r\n+ Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive.\r\n+ The mnemonic of a file write action can now be set via the `mnemonic` parameter of `ctx.actions.write`.\r\n+ Symbolic macros which use inherit_attrs now correctly inherit the aspect_hints attribute.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `linking_context.linkstamps` has been removed.\r\n+ If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.write` now supports path mapping when passed an `Args` object. Use the `mnemonics` attribute to assign it a dedicated mnemonic, which can then be used with `--modify_execution_info` to opt in to path mapping (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658 for details on path mapping).\r\n+ The new `--*_env==NAME` syntax can be used with any of `--action_env`, `--host_action_env`, `--repo_env`, `--run_env`, and `--test_env` to undo any previous occurrences of the respective flags for that environment variable name. For `--repo_env` and `--run_env`, this also results in the variable being unset if it is set in the environment of the Bazel client.\r\n+ Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host.\r\n+ The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly.\r\n+ Added flag `--experimental_thread_dump_interval` to allow Bazel dump threads periodically.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data` is now enabled by default. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330 for details.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Use `-I` instead of `-isystem` for `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes` attr. To use `-isystem` for only external repositories, you can pass `--features=external_include_paths --host_features=external_include_paths`. To use `-isystem` for a single `cc_library` / `cc_binary` `includes`, you can set `features = [\"system_include_paths\"],` on the target\r\n+ Flip `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` to enable setting `TARGET_CPU` make variable based on the target platform.\r\n+ The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries.\r\n+ \"blaze info install_md5\" is now available to tell the logical checksum of the Blaze server. This is mostly intended as a debugging aid.\r\n+ The contents of source directories are now tracked for invalidation. Using `glob` or explicit lists of files to consume source directories is still strongly preferred, but there may be cases in which this isn't feasible (e.g. file names that aren't valid labels).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** range doesn't accept None as second argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark string.split, string.rsplit don't accept None as argument\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** autoloads are disabled, issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** A `single_version_override` that pins a module to a lower version than requested in a `bazel_dep` for that module now results in an error instead of silently ignoring the `bazel_dep` version requirement. This is meant to catch a common source of bugs when updating a `bazel_dep` without noticing that it is overridden.\r\n+ The following rules have been removed from Bazel and must be loaded from `@rules_cc`: `cc_binary`, `cc_import`, `cc_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_shared_library`, `cc_static_library`, `cc_test`, `cc_toolchain`, `cc_toolchain_alias`, `objc_import`, `objc_library`, `fdo_prefetch_hints`, `fdo_profile`, `memprof_profile`, `propeller_optimize`\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Starlark list methods don't accept Nones.\r\n+ `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false` no longer works. Python rules can no longer set runtimes with `--python_top`. See https://rules-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains.html for toolchain & runtime configuration guidance.\r\n+ With the new `--incompatible_eagerly_resolve_select_keys` flag, the label string keys of `select` dicts in `.bzl` files are resolved relative to the containing file instead of relative to the BUILD file that ends up using the `select`. Use `native.package_relative_label` if this is not desired.\r\n+ The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`.\r\n+ native.existing_rule() and native.existing_rules() now correctly handle labels pointing to a different repo.\r\n+ Starlark string.split(), string.rsplit() now allow sep and maxsplit to be provided as keyword arguments.\r\n+ With `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` enabled (the default), Bazel will now refetch the respective repositories when it encounters external modifications. This is necessary to ensure correct incrementality. If you rely on external modifications to these repositories, either disable or the flag or use a supported mechanism such as `--override_repository`, `local_path_override` or `override_repo`.\r\n+ Module extensions can store a JSON-like Starlark object in `module_ctx.extension_metadata(facts = ...)` and retrieve it back in future evaluations of the extension via `module_ctx.facts` without any invalidation taking place.\r\n+ `ctx.actions.symlink` now accepts a `target_type` argument.\r\n+ OSS Bazel permits but ignores type annotations in .bzl files. Type annotations are experimental, and code that uses them may fail in future versions of Bazel.\r\n+ Add support for setting the `.bazelrc` path via a `BAZELRC` environment variable.\r\n+ If a java_import target's srcjar attribute refers to a source file, the file should exist.\r\n+ The `--module_mirrors` flag now supports specifying mirrors for individual registries via the syntax `--module_mirrors=<registry>=<mirror1>[,<mirror2>,...]`.\r\n+ The results of reproducible repository rules without dependencies added at runtime (e.g., via `repository_ctx.watch` or `.getenv`) can now be cached in a regular HTTP or gRPC remote cache if the new `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` startup option is provided.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest` is now enabled by default. If you encounter issues with runfile lookups failing at runtime, make sure that the language rulesets you use are up-to-date and runfiles libraries support the new format. Further details are available in the tracking issue https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26262.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Sky, Adin Cebic, Adrian Vogelsgesang, Agustin Mista, Alan Mond, Alberto Cavalcante, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Fax, Alexander Golovlev, Ankush Chudiwal, Austin Schuh, Benjamin Peterson, Benji Vos, Benson Muite, Bo Zhang, Boleyn Su, Bradley Bridges, Chris Sauer, Christian Scott, Christopher Rydell, Chuck Grindel, Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, DeeperMind, Dimi Shahbaz, Dmitry Ivankov, Dmitry Ryabkov, Ed Schouten, Eric Riff, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Greg, Grzegorz Lukasik, Han-Wen Nienhuys, helly25, Honnix, Ian Stapleton Cordasco, jacqueline.lee, Jaden Peterson, James Jenkins, James Judd, Javier Maestro, Jay Conrod, Jim Carroll, jjudd, John Millikin, Jon Shea, Jonathan Schear, Jonathan Woodbury, Jordan Mele, kalvdans, Keith Lea, Keith Smiley, Kevin Bernal, Kiron, kxxt, Lev Leontev, Lszl Csomor, Lucas Loffel, Luis Padron, Marcus Eagan, Mark Reuter, Markus Hofbauer, Matt Brown, Matt Smith, Mike Lundy, Mislav Mandaric, Nathan Naze, nialdaly, Pareesh Madan, Pelikan.B, Peter Li, Peter Lukacs, Philipp Stephani, PikachuHy, Ricard Sol, Richard Woodbury, Roman Salvador, Rostislav Rumenov, Ruoyu Zhong, Ryan Matthews, Sara Adams, sarad, Simon Thornington, Siva Mahadevan, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, Stephan Pleines, Steve Barrau, Taylor Barrella, tfrench, Thi Don, Timothy Gu, Tobias Werth, Tomasz Pasternak, Torgil Svensson, Ulrik Falklof, Valentin Grigorev, Vy Hong, Wade Carpenter, Will Stranton, Wojciech Mazur, xndcn, Yannic, Yannic Bonenberger, Zachary Kipping, and Zhongpeng Lin.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.7.0 (2025-10-30)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.7.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now requires the minimal glibc version of 2.25.\r\n* Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Tahoe. ([#27088](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27088))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix virtual headers symlink action for C++ headers ([#27411](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27411))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27219](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27219))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#27034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27034))\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#27216](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27216))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute mirror_urls as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#27004](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27004))\r\n* Fixed bazel mod path/all_paths behavior. ([#26937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26937))\r\n* The flag_alias directive is added to MODULE.bazel as a no-op for forward compatibility. ([#27335](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27335))\r\n* `single_version_override()` now accepts patch_cmds with no patches ([#27418](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27418))\r\n* Fall back to rctx.name if $original_name is empty ([#27437](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27437))\r\n* Don't suggest updates to private repo rule attributes ([#27436](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27436))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.2...release-7.7.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, Fabian Meumertzheim, Grzegorz Lukasik, Ruoyu Zhong, Son Luong Ngoc, Ulrik Falklof, and wudisheng.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.7.0rc3 (2025-10-28)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.7.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now requires the minimal glibc version of 2.25.\r\n* Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Tahoe. ([#27088](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27088))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix virtual headers symlink action for C++ headers ([#27411](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27411))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27219](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27219))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#27034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27034))\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#27216](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27216))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute mirror_urls as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#27004](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27004))\r\n* Fixed bazel mod path/all_paths behavior. ([#26937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26937))\r\n* The flag_alias directive is added to MODULE.bazel as a no-op for forward compatibility. ([#27335](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27335))\r\n* `single_version_override()` now accepts patch_cmds with no patches ([#27418](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27418))\r\n* Fall back to rctx.name if $original_name is empty ([#27437](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27437))\r\n* Don't suggest updates to private repo rule attributes ([#27436](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27436))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.2...release-7.7.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, Fabian Meumertzheim, Grzegorz Lukasik, Ruoyu Zhong, Son Luong Ngoc, Ulrik Falklof, and wudisheng.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.7.0rc2 (2025-10-27)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.7.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now requires the minimal glibc version of 2.25.\r\n* Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Tahoe. ([#27088](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27088))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27219](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27219))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#27034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27034))\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#27216](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27216))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute mirror_urls as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#27004](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27004))\r\n* Fixed bazel mod path/all_paths behavior. ([#26937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26937))\r\n* The flag_alias directive is added to MODULE.bazel as a no-op for forward compatibility. ([#27335](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27335))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.2...release-7.7.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as David Sanderson, David Zbarsky, Fabian Meumertzheim, Grzegorz Lukasik, Ruoyu Zhong, Son Luong Ngoc, Ulrik Falklof, and wudisheng.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.7.0rc1 (2025-10-20)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.7.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now requires the minimal glibc version of 2.25.\r\n* Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Tahoe. ([#27088](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27088))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* The new `ctx.configuration.short_id` field provides a short identifier for the current configuration that is understood by `bazel config`. ([#27219](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27219))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added `repository_ctx.original_name`, which contains the original value of the `name` attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#27034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27034))\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#27216](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27216))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute mirror_urls as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#27004](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27004))\r\n* Fixed bazel mod path/all_paths behavior. ([#26937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26937))\r\n* The flag_alias directive is added to MODULE.bazel as a no-op for forward compatibility. ([#27335](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27335))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.2...release-7.7.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as David Zbarsky, Fabian Meumertzheim, Grzegorz Lukasik, Ruoyu Zhong, Son Luong Ngoc, and Ulrik Falklof.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

(2025-10-08)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.2 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Tahoe. ([#27160](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/27160))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.1...release-7.6.2) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from Fabian Meumertzheim and Ruoyu Zhong.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

(2025-09-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.4.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Rollback of  \"Use the system trust store by default with the embedded JDK [#26881](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26681)\" ([#26935](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26935)).\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Speculative fix for repo contents cache race. ([#26950](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26950))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.4.0...release-8.4.1) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

(2025-09-09)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.4.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Rollback of  \"Use the system trust store by default with the embedded JDK [#26881](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26681)\" ([#26935](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26935)).\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.4.0...release-8.4.1) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.4.0 (2025-09-04)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel releases that include a bundled JDK now use the system trust store for certificates by default. Set `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore` and `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType` via `--host_jvm_args` to override the default location. (#26681)\r\n* The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly. ([#26670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26670))\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Add better defaults for mobile-install flags ([#26388](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26388))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on MacOS now respects XDG directory settings: if the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable is set, the output root directory is ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bazel, like on Linux ([#26773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26773))\r\n\r\n## C / C++\r\n* If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating the long path issue with MSVC on Windows. ([#26532](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26532))\r\n* Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host. ([#26598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26598))\r\n\r\n## Coverage\r\n* Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation. ([#26461](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26461))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compact format when necessary. ([#26420](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26420))\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#26462](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26462))\r\n* Repository content cache is disabled by default due to [#26450](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26450), you can still manually enable it by setting --repo_contents_cache=<path>.\r\n* The new `--module_mirrors` flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries. ([#26850](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26850))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.3.1...release-8.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Sky, Adrian Vogelsgesang, Dmitry Ryabkov, Ed Schouten, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Greg, James Judd, Jonathan Woodbury, Keith Smiley, Pelikan.B, Valentin Grigorev, Wade Carpenter, and Xavier Bonaventura.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.
