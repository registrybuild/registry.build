This implementation takes advantage of the fact that Mayhem normally stores login credentials in a default config directory, and respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. By combining the two, we can give bazel information about where the credentials are without actually exposing them, and rely on the Mayhem CLI to use the credentials for running commands.

Previously, Mayhem tokens passed by `--action_env` could be read in the logs of the remote Bazel cache. Normally, this would only be an issue if an external party had access to the bazel cache. However, some customers share their cache across their organization, which would allow members of one team to view the logs in the cache from another team. Tokens are cheap and easy to regenerate, but Mayhem does not enforce an expiration for tokens, so these leaks can become a problem.

cache."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/224688455","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/224688455/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/224688455/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/tag/0.7.8","id":224688455,"author":{"login":"xansec","id":76011430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDExNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76011430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec","html_url":"https://github.com/xansec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOJmqXm84NZHlH","tag_name":"0.7.8","target_commitish":"main","name":"0.7.8","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2025-06-11T18:09:23Z","updated_at":"2025-06-11T18:27:37Z","published_at":"2025-06-11T18:19:04Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/assets/263017822","id":263017822,"node_id":"RA_kwDOJmqXm84PrVVe","name":"rules_mayhem-0.7.8.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"xansec","id":76011430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDExNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76011430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec","html_url":"https://github.com/xansec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xansec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":31930,"digest":"sha256:dea38cb85e6e98892c6c1399227ea08407db9570abe704aa4ff10b11350e5a20","download_count":1,"created_at":"2025-06-11T18:27:37Z","updated_at":"2025-06-11T18:27:37Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/releases/download/0.7.8/rules_mayhem-0.7.8.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/tarball/0.7.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForAllSecure/rules_mayhem/zipball/0.7.8","body":"##

`rules_mayhem` 0.7.2. New features:\r\n\r\n- Support waiting for a `mayhem_run()` rule to finish with `wait = True`. \r\n- Support specifying Mayhemfile configuration directly in the `mayhem_run()` rule\r\n  - `mayhemfile()` has been renamed to `mayhem_init()`\r\n  - `mayhem_init()` (previously `mayhemfile()`) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Favor specifying Mayhemfile parameters directly in the `mayhem_run()` rule. This simplifies workflow.\r\n- Support task specification in `mayhem_run()`; can specify only regression, for example, with `regression = True`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* add mayhem wait by
