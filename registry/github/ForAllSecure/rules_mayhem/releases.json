Previously, Mayhem tokens passed by `--action_env` could be read in the logs of the remote Bazel cache. Normally, this would only be an issue if an external party had access to the bazel cache. However, some customers share their cache across their organization, which would allow members of one team to view the logs in the cache from another team. Tokens are cheap and easy to regenerate, but Mayhem does not enforce an expiration for tokens, so these leaks can become a problem.
