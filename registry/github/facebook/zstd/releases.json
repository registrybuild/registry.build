`v1.5.7` is a significant release, featuring over 500 commits accumulated over the past year. This update brings enhancements across various domains, including performance, stability, and functionality, and is particularly recommended for 32-bit users due to a bug fix detailed below.\r\n\r\n_edit_: man pages were not properly updated in this package, and are still pointing to `v1.5.6`. If you want the `v1.5.7` version, they are updated in `dev` branch, and can be cherry-picked using commit 6af3842118ea5325480b403213b2a9fbed3d3d74. Alternatively, they can also be built locally using `make manual` and `make -C programs man`.\r\n\r\n## Performance Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Compression Speed for Small Data Blocks\r\n\r\nThe compression speed for small data blocks has been notably improved at fast compression levels, thanks to contributions from @TocarIP, further extended in #4165. Below are benchmark results illustrating the performance improvements for level 1 compression on the Silesia corpus, segmented into different block sizes:\r\n\r\n| Block Size | v1.5.6 | v1.5.7 | Improv. |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n|   4 KB | 280 MB/s | 310 MB/s | +10% |\r\n|   8 KB | 328 MB/s | 364 MB/s | +11% |\r\n|  16 KB | 360 MB/s | 396 MB/s | +10% |\r\n|  32 KB | 383 MB/s | 458 MB/s | +20% |\r\n|  64 KB | 423 MB/s | 474 MB/s | +12% |\r\n| 128 KB | 460 MB/s | 485 MB/s | +5% |\r\n\r\nThese improvements are particularly beneficial in data centers and databases, where data is often divided into small segments to enhance seekability. A notable example is [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb), which is frequently configured with block sizes around 16 KB. Such systems will experience an immediate performance boost by updating their compression library to `v1.5.7`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the speed improvements partially extend to dictionary compression, with observed gains ranging from none to +15%.\r\n\r\n### Substantial `--patch-from` improvements\r\n\r\nThe  `--patch-from`  functionality of the  `zstd`  CLI allows for differential compression of a file given an older version, similar to  `bsdiff`. While compression levels impact processing speed and compression ratio as expected, at high compression levels (18+), speed was previously reduced to uncomfortable levels.\r\n\r\n`v1.5.7`  largely mitigates the speed impact of high compression levels 18+, as illustrated in the following scenario, which compresses  `linux-6.13.tar`  as a difference from  `linux-6.12.tar`  using 6 threads:\r\n\r\n| level | v1.5.6 | v1.5.7 | Improv. |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 18 | 210 s | 42.7 s | x4.9 |\r\n| 19 | 273 s | 61.8 s | x4.4 |\r\n| 20 | 310 s | 82.3 s | x3.8 |\r\n| 21 | 365 s | 120 s | x3.1 |\r\n\r\nAdditionally, compression ratio of `--patch-from`  is also substantially improved across the board, including higher compression levels:\r\n\r\n| level | v1.5.6 | v1.5.7 | Improv. |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 15 | 6,383,341 | 6,003,514 | 6.3% |\r\n| 16 | 5,909,932 | 5,421,444 | 9.0% |\r\n| 17 | 5,613,879 | 5,214,734 | 7.7% |\r\n| 18 | 5,584,219 | 5,075,507 |10.0% |\r\n| 19 | 5,322,658 | 4,724,116 |12.6% |\r\n| 20 | 5,097,236 | 4,583,435 |11.2% |\r\n| 21 | 4,648,583 | 4,297,672 | 8.1% |\r\n| 22 | 4,560,051 | 4,225,283 | 7.9% |\r\n| `--max` |  N/A | 3,999,476 |\r\n    \r\n### Compression ratio improvements for large files\r\n\r\nThe compression ratio has been enhanced slightly for large data across all compression levels, thanks to a refined approach in selecting block boundaries. This improvement is more pronounced at lower compression levels (≤ 15), where the previous boundary selection method was relatively basic. In contrast, higher compression levels (16+) already employed some analysis, but still benefit from the introduction of the new heuristic, resulting in marginally better compression ratios.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the compression ratios between  `v1.5.6`  and  `v1.5.7`  is presented below:\r\n\r\n| level | `v1.5.6` | `v1.5.7` | Improv. |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | ---:|\r\n| 1 | 73,492,125 | 73,292,801 | -199,324\r\n| 3 | 66,555,241 | 66,217,754 | -337,487\r\n| 6 | 61,614,472 | 61,350,571 | -263,901\r\n| 8 | 60,089,890 | 59,816,878 | -273,012\r\n|12 | 58,297,345 | 58,039,924 | -257,421\r\n|15 | 57,290,517 | 57,031,235 | -259,282\r\n|16 | 55,341,618 | 55,304,857 | -36,761\r\n|19 | 52,876,557 | 52,840,800 | -35,757\r\n|22 | 52,326,420 | 52,289,718 | -36,702\r\n\r\n\r\n## Command-Line Interface Updates\r\n\r\nRecognizing the prevalence of multi-core systems, `zstd` now employs **multiple threads by default**, thanks to #4211 by @daniellerozenblit\r\nIn `v1.5.7`, systems will see default threading scaled according to capability, but remains cautious to mitigate risks of overloading surprises on existing user base, with a maximum of 4 threads by default.\r\nFor example, a typical \"low-end\" system with 4 cores and hyperthreading will employ 2 threads by default. A \"higher-end\" system with 8 cores and hyperthreading will employ 4 threads by default. \r\n\r\nThese modifications only impact default settings. As usual, the number of threads that `zstd` uses can also be set manually, either via command line or via environment variables.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new `zstd` command `--max` is available, designed to maximize compression ratios by leveraging all parameters, at the expense of time and memory. It's slower and more resource hungry than `--ultra -22`, but achieves denser compressed archives if that's the goal. For instance, compressing `enwik9` (1,000,000,000 bytes) at `--max` level on a i7-9700k platform yields:\r\n\r\n| level | cSize | cTime | cMem |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `--ultra -22` | 213,898,083 | ~6 mn | ~ 3 GB |\r\n| `--max` | 202,507,076 | ~72 mn | ~ 18 GB |\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n`v1.5.7` resolves a long standing and very rare compression issue in 32-bit mode, which can be triggered during long-lasting sessions (same `ZSTD_CCtx*` being continuously reused). This issue required several conditions to be met and a large amount of data to occur, but at the scale of `zstd` usage, it has been observed and reported (#4292).\r\nIn summary, if you use `libzstd` in 32-bit mode, this update is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThe release also brings its lot of various improvements, impacting build scripts (cmake, meson, Apple Framework, Visual Studio), documentation and portability (QNX, FreeBSD, Hurd, icc/icx).\r\nNotably, there are measurable performance gains for binaries produced with Visual Studio, as a cumulative result of several contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n- fix: compression bug in 32-bit mode associated with long-lasting sessions\r\n- perf: substantial compression speed improvements (up to +30%) on

release highlights the deployment of Google [Chrome 123](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-123), introducing `zstd-encoding` for Web traffic, offered as a preferable option for compression of dynamic contents. With limited web server support for `zstd-encoding` due to its novelty, we are launching an updated Zstandard version to facilitate broader adoption.\r\n\r\n### Improved latency (time to first delivered byte) for web pages \r\nUsing `zstd` compression for large documents over the Internet, data is segmented into smaller blocks. This is crucial for applications like Chrome that process parts of documents as they arrive. However, blocks can have a size of up to 128 KB by default, which can be large for congested networks.\r\nTo mitigate such scenarios and improve \"time to first delivered byte\", `libzstd` introduces the new [parameter `ZSTD_c_targetCBlockSize`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.5.6/lib/zstd.h#L394), enabling the division of blocks into even smaller segments, resulting in desirable latency reduction, notably beneficial in areas with more congested network infrastructure.\r\nThis parameter must be set explicitly, because it is not free: it incurs a small cpu cost (equivalent to -2% speed at level 8) and a small compression efficiency decrease (<0.1%), both of which look reasonable but nonetheless non-zero.\r\n\r\n### Improved compression ratio at high levels\r\nHighest compression levels (typically 18+) receive some compression ratio improvement. The improvement is [really noticeable for 32-bit structures](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3895), like arrays of `int` for example. A real-world example would the `.debug_str_offsets` section of `DWARF` debug info within `ELF` executables, mentioned in #2832, for which the compression effectiveness increases by +35%. It's not rare for many files or objects to contain sections of 32-bit structures, resulting in corresponding compression ratio improvements.\r\n\r\n### Granular binary size selection\r\n`libzstd` provides build customization, including options to compile only the compression or decompression modules, minimizing binary size. Enhanced in `v1.5.6` ([source](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/dev/lib#modular-build)), it now allows for even finer control by enabling selective inclusion or exclusion of specific components within these modules. This advancement aids applications needing precise binary size management.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous Enhancements\r\nThis release includes various minor enhancements and bug fixes to enhance user experience. Key updates include an expanded list of recognized compressed file suffixes for the `--exclude-compressed` flag, improving efficiency by skipping presumed incompressible content. Furthermore, compatibility has been broadened to include additional chipsets (`sparc64`, `ARM64EC`, `risc-v`) and operating systems (`QNX`, `AIX`, `Solaris`, `HP-UX`).\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\napi:

is a quick fix release. The primary focus is to correct a rare corruption bug in high compression mode, detected by @danlark1 . The probability to generate such a scenario by random chance is extremely low. It evaded months of continuous fuzzer tests, due to the number and complexity of simultaneous conditions required to trigger it. Nevertheless, @danlark1 from Google shepherds such a humongous amount of data that he managed to detect a reproduction case (corruptions are detected thanks to the checksum), making it possible for @terrelln to investigate and fix the bug. Thanks !  \r\nWhile the probability might be very small, corruption issues are nonetheless very serious, so an update to this version is highly recommended, especially if you employ high compression modes (levels 16+).\r\n\r\nWhen the issue was detected, there were a number of other improvements and minor fixes already in the making, hence they are also present in this release. Let’s detail the main ones.\r\n\r\n### Improved memory usage and speed for the `--patch-from` mode\r\n\r\n`V1.5.5` introduces memory-mapped dictionaries, by @daniellerozenblit, for both posix [#3486](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3486) and windows [#3557](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3557).\r\n\r\nThis feature allows `zstd` to memory-map large dictionaries, rather than requiring to load them into memory. This can make a pretty big difference for memory-constrained environments operating patches for large data sets. \r\nIt's mostly visible under memory pressure, since `mmap` will be able to release less-used memory and continue working.\r\nBut even when memory is plentiful, there are still measurable memory benefits, as shown in the graph below, especially when the reference turns out to be not completely relevant for the patch.\r\n\r\n![mmap_memory_usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48103643/223875190-1c83877c-d9dc-4b1d-99f3-e441d908b15d.png)\r\n\r\nThis feature is automatically enabled for `--patch-from` compression/decompression when the dictionary is larger than the user-set memory limit. It can also be manually enabled/disabled using `--mmap-dict` or `--no-mmap-dict` respectively.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, @daniellerozenblit introduces significant speed improvements for `--patch-from`.\r\n\r\nAn `I/O` optimization in [#3486](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3486) greatly  improves `--patch-from` decompression speed on Linux, typically by `+50%` on large files (~1GB).\r\n\r\n![patch-from_IO_optimization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48103643/224113381-f852579f-b403-4038-961d-22dbbc12dd7f.png)\r\n\r\nCompression speed is also taken care of, with a dictionary-indexing speed optimization introduced in [#3545](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3545). It wildly accelerates `--patch-from` compression, typically doubling speed on large files (~1GB), sometimes even more depending on exact scenario. \r\n\r\n![patch_from_compression_speed_optimization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48103643/224391113-05de7ed3-5c62-4cb4-a4a4-eaa7576aa5b6.png)\r\n\r\nThis speed improvement comes at a slight regression in compression ratio, and is therefore enabled only on non-ultra compression strategies.\r\n\r\n### Speed improvements of middle-level compression for specific scenarios\r\n\r\nThe row-hash match finder introduced in version 1.5.0 for levels 5-12 has been improved in version 1.5.5, enhancing its speed in specific corner-case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe first optimization ([#3426](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/pull/3426)) accelerates streaming compression using `ZSTD_compressStream` on small inputs by removing an expensive table initialization step. This results in remarkable speed increases for very small inputs.\r\n\r\nThe following scenario measures compression speed of `ZSTD_compressStream` at level 9 for different sample sizes on a linux platform running an i7-9700k cpu.\r\n| sample size | `v1.5.4` (MB/s) | `v1.5.5` (MB/s) | improvement |\r\n| --- | ----:| ---:| --- |\r\n| 100 |  1.4 |  44.8 | x32\r\n| 200 |  2.8 |  44.9 | x16\r\n| 500 |  6.5 |  60.0 | x9.2\r\n| 1K  | 12.4 |  70.0 | x5.6\r\n| 2K  | 25.0 | 111.3 | x4.4\r\n| 4K  | 44.4 | 139.4 | x3.2\r\n| ... | ... | ... |\r\n| 1M  | 97.5 |  99.4 | +2% \r\n\r\nThe second optimization ([#3552](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/3552)) speeds up compression of incompressible data by a large multiplier. This is achieved by increasing the step size and reducing the frequency of matching when no matches are found, with negligible impact on the compression ratio. It makes mid-level compression essentially inexpensive when processing incompressible data, typically, already compressed data (note: this was already the case for fast compression levels).\r\n\r\nThe following scenario measures compression speed of `ZSTD_compress` compiled with `gcc-9` for a ~10MB incompressible sample on a linux platform running an i7-9700k cpu.\r\n\r\n| level | `v1.5.4` (MB/s) | `v1.5.5` (MB/s) | improvement | \r\n| --- | ----:| ---:| --- | \r\n| 3 | 3500 | 3500 | not a row-hash level (control)\r\n| 5 | 400 | 2500 | x6.2\r\n| 7 | 380 | 2200 | x5.8\r\n| 9 | 176 | 1880 | x10\r\n| 11 | 67 | 1130 | x16\r\n| 13 | 89 | 89 | not a row-hash level (control)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThere are other welcome speed improvements in this package.\r\n\r\nFor example, @felixhandte managed to increase processing speed of small files by carefully reducing the nb of system calls  (#3479). This can easily translate into +10% speed when processing a lot of small files in batch. \r\n\r\nThe Seekable format received a bit of care. It's now much faster when splitting data into very small blocks (#3544). In an extreme scenario reported by @P-E-Meunier, it improves processing speed by x90. Even for more \"common\" settings, such as using 4KB blocks on some \"normally\" compressible data like `enwik`, it still provides a healthy x2 processing speed benefit. Moreover, @dloidolt merged an optimization that reduces the nb of `I/O` `seek()` events during reads (decompression), which is also beneficial for speed.\r\n\r\nThe release is not limited to speed improvements, several loose ends and corner cases were also fixed in this release.

`v1.5.4` is a pretty big release benefiting from one year of work, spread over > 650 commits. It offers significant performance improvements across multiple scenarios, as well as new features (detailed below). There is a crop of little bug fixes too, a few ones targeting the 32-bit mode are important enough to make this release a recommended upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Various Speed improvements\r\nThis release has accumulated a number of scenario-specific improvements, that cumulatively benefit a good portion of installed base in one way or another.\r\n\r\nAmong the easier ones to describe, the repository has received several contributions for `arm` optimizations, notably from @JunHe77 and @danlark1. And @terrelln has improved decompression speed for non-x64 systems, including `arm`. The combination of this work is visible in the following example, using an M1-Pro (`aarch64` architecture) :\r\n\r\n| cpu | function | corpus | `v1.5.2` | `v1.5.4` | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| M1 Pro | decompress | `silesia.tar` | 1370 MB/s | 1480 MB/s | + 8% |\r\n| Galaxy S22 | decompress | `silesia.tar` | 1150 MB/s | 1200 MB/s | + 4% |\r\n\r\nMiddle compression levels (5-12) receive some care too, with @terrelln improving the dispatch engine, and @danlark1 offering `NEON` optimizations. Exact speed up vary depending on platform, cpu, compiler,  and compression level, though one can expect gains ranging from +1 to +10% depending on scenarios.\r\n\r\n| cpu | function | corpus | `v1.5.2` | `v1.5.4` | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | ---:| ---:| --- |\r\n| i7-9700k | compress -6  | `silesia.tar` | 110 MB/s | 121 MB/s | +10%\r\n| Galaxy S22 | compress -6  | `silesia.tar` | 98 MB/s | 103 MB/s | +5%\r\n| M1 Pro | compress -6  | `silesia.tar` | 122 MB/s | 130 MB/s | +6.5%\r\n| i7-9700k | compress -9  | `silesia.tar` | 64 MB/s | 70 MB/s | +9.5%\r\n| Galaxy S22 | compress -9  | `silesia.tar` | 51 MB/s | 52 MB/s | +1%\r\n| M1 Pro | compress -9  | `silesia.tar` | 77 MB/s | 86 MB/s | +11.5%\r\n| i7-9700k | compress -12  | `silesia.tar` | 31.6 MB/s | 31.8 MB/s | +0.5%\r\n| Galaxy S22 | compress -12  | `silesia.tar` | 20.9 MB/s | 22.1 MB/s | +5%\r\n| M1 Pro | compress -12 | `silesia.tar` | 36.1 MB/s | 39.7 MB/s | +10%\r\n\r\nSpeed of the streaming compression interface has been improved by @embg in scenarios involving large files (where size is a multiple of the `windowSize` parameter). The improvement is mostly perceptible at high speeds (i.e. ~level 1). In the following sample, the measurement is taken directly at `ZSTD_compressStream()` function call, using a dedicated benchmark tool `tests/fullbench`.\r\n\r\n| cpu | function | corpus | `v1.5.2` | `v1.5.4` | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| i7-9700k | `ZSTD_compressStream()` -1 | `silesia.tar` | 392 MB/s | 429 MB/s | +9.5% |\r\n| Galaxy S22 |  `ZSTD_compressStream()` -1 | `silesia.tar` | 380 MB/s | 430 MB/s | +13% |\r\n| M1 Pro | `ZSTD_compressStream()` -1 | `silesia.tar` | 476 MB/s | 539 MB/s | +13% |\r\n\r\nFinally, dictionary compression speed has received a good boost by @embg. Exact outcome varies depending on system and corpus. The following result is achieved by cutting the `enwik8` compression corpus into 1KB blocks, generating a dictionary from these blocks, and then benchmarking the compression speed at level 1.\r\n\r\n| cpu | function | corpus | `v1.5.2` | `v1.5.4` | Improvement |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| i7-9700k | dictionary compress | `enwik8` -B1K | 125 MB/s | 165 MB/s | +32% |\r\n| Galaxy S22 |  dictionary compress | `enwik8` -B1K | 138 MB/s | 166 MB/s | +20% |\r\n| M1 Pro | dictionary compress | `enwik8` -B1K | 155 MB/s | 195 MB/s | +25 % |\r\n\r\nThere are a few more scenario-specifics improvements listed in the `changelog` section below.\r\n\r\n### I/O Performance improvements\r\nThe 1.5.4 release improves IO performance of `zstd` CLI, by using system buffers (`macos`) and adding a new asynchronous I/O capability, enabled by default on large files (when threading is available). The user can also explicitly control this capability with the `--[no-]asyncio` flag .  These new threads remove the need to block on IO operations. The impact is mostly noticeable when decompressing large files (>= a few MBs), though exact outcome depends on environment and run conditions.\r\nDecompression speed gets significant gains due to its single-threaded serial nature and the high speeds involved. In some cases we observe up to double performance improvement (local Mac machines) and a wide +15-45% benefit on Intel Linux servers (see table for details).  \r\nOn the compression side of things, we’ve measured up to 5% improvements. The impact is lower because compression is already partially asynchronous via the internal MT mode (see release [v1.3.4](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.4)). \r\n\r\nThe following table shows the elapsed run time for decompressions of `silesia` and `enwik8` on several platforms - some Skylake-era Linux servers and an M1 MacbookPro. It compares the time it takes for version `v1.5.2` to version `v1.5.4` with asyncio on and off.\r\n \r\n\r\nplatform | corpus | `v1.5.2` | `v1.5.4-no-asyncio` | `v1.5.4` | Improvement\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nXeon D-2191A CentOS8 | `enwik8` | 280 MB/s | 280 MB/s | 324 MB/s | +16%\r\nXeon D-2191A CentOS8 | `silesia.tar` | 303 MB/s | 302 MB/s | 386 MB/s | +27%\r\ni7-1165g7 win10 | `enwik8` | 270 MB/s | 280 MB/s | 350 MB/s | +27%\r\ni7-1165g7 win10 | `silesia.tar` | 450 MB/s | 440 MB/s | 580 MB/s | +28%\r\ni7-9700K Ubuntu20 | `enwik8` | 600 MB/s | 604 MB/s | 829 MB/s | +38%\r\ni7-9700K Ubuntu20 | `silesia.tar` | 683 MB/s | 678 MB/s | 991 MB/s | +45%\r\nGalaxy S22 | `enwik8` | 360 MB/s | 420 MB/s | 515 MB/s | +70%\r\nGalaxy S22 | `silesia.tar` | 310 MB/s | 320 MB/s | 580 MB/s | +85%\r\nMBP M1 | `enwik8` | 428 MB/s | 734 MB/s | 815 MB/s | +90%\r\nMBP M1 | `silesia.tar` | 465 MB/s | 875 MB/s | 1001 MB/s | +115%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support of externally-defined sequence producers\r\n\r\n`libzstd` can now support external sequence producers via a new advanced registration function `ZSTD_registerSequenceProducer()` (#3333). \r\nThis API allows users to provide their own custom sequence producer which libzstd invokes to process each block. The produced list of sequences (literals and matches) is then post-processed by libzstd to produce valid compressed blocks.\r\n\r\nThis block-level offload API is a more granular complement of the existing frame-level offload API `compressSequences()` (introduced in `v1.5.1`). It offers an easier migration story for applications already integrated with `libzstd`: the user application continues to invoke the same compression functions `ZSTD_compress2()` or `ZSTD_compressStream2()` as usual, and transparently benefits from the specific properties of the external sequence producer. For example, the sequence producer could be tuned to take advantage of known characteristics of the input, to offer better speed / ratio.\r\n\r\nOne scenario that becomes possible is to combine this capability with hardware-accelerated matchfinders, such as the Intel® QuickAssist accelerator (Intel® QAT) provided in server CPUs such as the 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (previously codenamed Sapphire Rapids). More details to be provided in future communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\nperf: +20% faster huffman decompression for targets that can't compile x64 assembly (#3449, @terrelln)\r\nperf: up

v1.5.2 is a bug-fix release, addressing issues that were raised with the v1.5.1 release.\r\n\r\nIn particular, as a side-effect of the inclusion of assembly code in our source tree, binary artifacts

This release corrects that issue. More context is available in #2963.\r\n\r\nThis release also corrects a performance regression that was introduced in v1.5.0 that slows down compression of very small data when using the streaming API. Issue #2966 tracks that topic.\r\n\r\nIn addition there are a number of smaller improvements and fixes.\r\n\r\n## Full Changelist\r\n* Fix zstd-static output name with MINGW/Clang by @MehdiChinoune in

: it has been brought to our attention that the `v1.5.1` library might be built with an executable stack on non-`x64` architectures, which could end up being flagged as problematic by some systems with thorough security settings which disallow executable stack. We are currently reviewing the issue. Be aware of it if you build `libzstd` for non-`x64` architecture.\r\n\r\nZstandard v1.5.1 is a maintenance release, bringing a good number of small refinements to the project. It also offers a welcome crop of performance improvements, as detailed below.\r\n\r\n## Performance Improvements\r\n\r\n### Speed improvements for fast compression (levels 1–4)\r\n\r\nPRs #2749, #2774, and #2921 refactor single-segment compression for `ZSTD_fast` and `ZSTD_dfast`, which back compression levels 1 through 4 (as well as the negative compression levels). Speedups in the ~3-5% range are observed. In addition, the compression ratio of `ZSTD_dfast` (levels 3 and 4) is slightly improved.\r\n\r\n### Rebalanced middle compression levels\r\n\r\n`v1.5.0` introduced major speed improvements for mid-level compression (from 5 to 12), while preserving roughly similar compression ratio. As a consequence, the speed scale became tilted towards faster speed. Unfortunately,  the difference between successive levels was no longer regular, and there is a large performance gap just after the impacted range, between levels 12 and 13.\r\n\r\n`v1.5.1` tries to rebalance parameters so that compression levels can be roughly associated to their former speed budget. Consequently, `v1.5.1` mid compression levels feature speeds closer to former `v1.4.9` (though still sensibly faster) and receive in exchange an improved compression ratio, as shown in below graph.\r\n\r\n![comparing v1.4.9 vs v1.5.0 vs 1.5.1on x64 (i7-9700k)](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/download/v1.5.1/zstd151_silesia_9700k.png)\r\n\r\n![comparing v1.4.9 vs v1.5.0 vs 1.5.1 on arm64 (snapdragon 855)](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/download/v1.5.1/zstd151_silesia_snap855.png)\r\n\r\nNote that, since middle levels only experience a rebalancing, save some special cases, no significant performance differences between versions `v1.5.0` and `v1.5.1` should be expected: levels merely occupy different positions on the same curve. The situation is a bit different for fast levels (1-4), for which `v1.5.1` delivers a small but consistent performance benefit on all platforms, as described in previous paragraph.\r\n\r\n### Huffman Improvements\r\nOur Huffman code was significantly revamped in this release. Both encoding and decoding speed were improved. Additionally, encoding speed for small inputs was improved even further. Speed is measured on the Silesia corpus by  compressing with level 1 and extracting the literals left over after compression. Then compressing and decompressing the literals from each block. Measurements are done on an Intel i9-9900K @ 3.6 GHz.\r\n\r\n| Compiler | Scenario                            | v1.5.0 Speed | v1.5.1 Speed | Delta  |\r\n|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------|\r\n| gcc-11   | Literal compression - 128KB block   | 748 MB/s     | 927 MB/s     | +23.9% |\r\n| clang-13 | Literal compression - 128KB block   | 810 MB/s     | 927 MB/s     | +14.4% |\r\n| gcc-11   | Literal compression - 4KB block     | 223 MB/s     | 321 MB/s     | +44.0% |\r\n| clang-13   | Literal compression - 4KB block     | 224 MB/s     | 310 MB/s     | +38.2% |\r\n| gcc-11   | Literal decompression - 128KB block | 1164 MB/s    | 1500 MB/s    | +28.8% |\r\n| clang-13 | Literal decompression - 128KB block | 1006 MB/s    | 1504 MB/s    | +49.5% |\r\n\r\nOverall impact on (de)compression speed depends on the compressibility of the data. Compression speed improves from 1-4%, and decompression speed improves from 5-15%. \r\n\r\nPR #2722 implements the Huffman decoder in assembly for x86-64 with BMI2 enabled. We detect BMI2 support at runtime, so this speedup applies to all x86-64 builds running on CPUs that support BMI2. This improves Huffman decoding speed by about 40%, depending on the scenario. PR #2733 improves Huffman encoding speed by 10% for clang and 20% for gcc.  PR #2732 drastically speeds up the `HUF_sort()` function, which speeds up Huffman tree building for compression. This is a significant speed boost for small inputs, measuring in at a 40% improvement for 4K inputs.\r\n\r\n## Binary Size and Build Speed\r\n\r\n`zstd` binary size grew significantly in `v1.5.0` due to the new code added for middle compression level speed optimizations. In this release we recover the binary size, and in the process also significantly speed up builds, especially with sanitizers enabled.\r\n\r\nMeasured on x86-64 compiled with `-O3` we measure `libzstd.a` size. We regained 161 KB of binary size on gcc, and 293 KB of binary size on clang. Note that these binary sizes are listed for the whole library, optimized for speed over size. The decoder only, with size saving options enabled, and compiled with `-Os` or `-Oz` can be much smaller.\r\n\r\n| Version | gcc-11 size | clang-13 size |\r\n|---------|-------------|---------------|\r\n| v1.5.1  | 1177 KB     | 1167 KB       |\r\n| v1.5.0  | 1338 KB     | 1460 KB       |\r\n| v1.4.9  | 1137 KB     | 1151 KB       |\r\n\r\n\r\n##

is a major release featuring large performance improvements as well as API changes.\r\n\r\n# Performance\r\n\r\n## Improved Middle-Level Compression Speed\r\n\r\n1.5.0 introduces a new default match finder for the compression strategies `greedy`, `lazy`, and `lazy2`, (which map to levels 5-12 for inputs larger than 256K). The optimization brings a massive improvement in compression speed with slight perturbations in compression ratio (< 0.5%) and equal or decreased memory usage.\r\n\r\nBenchmarked with gcc, on an i9-9900K:\r\n| level | `silesia.tar` speed delta | `enwik7` speed delta |\r\n|--------|-----------|------------|\r\n| 5 | +25% | +25% |\r\n| 6 | +50% | +50% |\r\n| 7 | +40% | +40% |\r\n| 8 | +40% | +50% |\r\n| 9 | +50% | +65% |\r\n| 10 | +65% | +80% |\r\n| 11 | +85% | +105% |\r\n| 12 | +110% | +140% |\r\n\r\nOn heavily loaded machines with significant cache contention, we have internally measured _even larger gains_: 2-3x+ speed at levels 5-7. 🚀\r\n\r\nThe biggest gains are achieved on files typically larger than 128KB. On files smaller than 16KB, by default we revert back to the legacy match finder which becomes the faster one. This default policy can be overriden manually: the new match finder can be forcibly enabled with the advanced parameter `ZSTD_c_useRowMatchFinder`, or through the CLI option `--[no-]row-match-finder`.\r\n\r\nNote: only CPUs that support `SSE2` realize the full extent of this improvement.\r\n\r\n## Improved High-Level Compression Ratio\r\n\r\nImproving compression ratio via block splitting is now enabled by default for high compression levels (16+). The amount of benefit varies depending on the workload. Compressing archives comprised of heavily differing files will see more improvement than compression of single files that don’t vary much entropically (like text files/enwik). At levels 16+, we observe no measurable regression to compression speed.\r\n\r\n**level 22 compression**\r\n| file | ratio 1.4.9 | ratio 1.5.0 | ratio % delta |\r\n|-----|---------|--------|-------|\r\n| silesia.tar | 4.021 | 4.041 | +0.49% |\r\n| calgary.tar | 3.646 | 3.672 | +0.71% |\r\n| enwik7 | 3.579 | 3.579 | +0.0% |\r\n\r\nThe block splitter can be forcibly enabled on lower compression levels as well with the advanced parameter `ZSTD_c_splitBlocks`. When forcibly enabled at lower levels, speed regressions can become more notable. Additionally, since more compressed blocks may be produced, decompression speed on these blobs may also see small regressions.\r\n\r\n## Faster Decompression Speed\r\n\r\nThe decompression speed of data compressed with large window settings (such as `--long` or `--ultra`) has been significantly improved in this version. The gains vary depending on compiler brand and version, with `clang` generally benefiting the most.\r\n\r\nThe following benchmark was measured by compressing `enwik9` at level `--ultra -22` (with a 128 MB window size) on a core i7-9700K.\r\n\r\n| Compiler version | D. Speed improvement |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| gcc-7 | +15% |\r\n| gcc-8 | +10 % |\r\n| gcc-9 | +5% |\r\n| gcc-10 | +1% |\r\n| clang-6 | +21% |\r\n| clang-7 | +16% |\r\n| clang-8 | +16% |\r\n| clang-9 | +18% |\r\n| clang-10 | +16% |\r\n| clang-11 | +15% |\r\n\r\nAverage decompression speed for “normal” payload is slightly improved too, though the impact is less impressive. Once again, mileage varies depending on exact compiler version, payload, and even compression level. In general, a majority of scenarios see benefits ranging from +1 to +9%. There are also a few outliers here and there, from -4% to +13%. The average gain across all these scenarios stands at ~+4%.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Library Updates\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Library Supports Multithreading by Default\r\n\r\nIt was already possible to compile `libzstd` with multithreading support. But it was an active operation. By default, the `make` build script would build `libzstd` as a single-thread-only library.\r\n\r\nThis changes in `v1.5.0`.\r\nNow the dynamic library (typically `libzstd.so.1` on Linux) supports multi-threaded compression by default.\r\nNote that this property is not extended to the static library (typically `libzstd.a` on Linux) because doing so would have impacted the build script of existing client applications (requiring them to add `-pthread` to their recipe), thus potentially breaking their build. In order to avoid this disruption, the static library remains single-threaded by default.\r\nLuckily, this build disruption does not extend to the dynamic library, which can be built with multi-threading support while existing applications linking to `libzstd.so` and expecting only single-thread capabilities will be none the wiser, and remain completely unaffected.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that starting from `v1.5.0`, applications can _expect_ the dynamic library to support multi-threading should they need it, which will progressively lead to increased adoption of this capability overtime.\r\nThat being said, since the locally deployed dynamic library may, or may not, support multi-threading compression, depending on local build configuration, it’s always better to check this capability at runtime. For this goal, it’s enough to check the return value when changing parameter `ZSTD_c_nbWorkers` , and if it results in an error, then multi-threading is not supported.\r\n\r\n_Q: What if I prefer to keep the libraries in single-thread mode only ?_\r\nThe target `make lib-nomt` will ensure this outcome.\r\n\r\n_Q: Actually, I want both static and dynamic library versions to support multi-threading !_\r\nThe target `make lib-mt` will generate this outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Promotions to Stable\r\n\r\nMoving up to the higher digit `1.5` signals an opportunity to extend the _stable_ portion of `zstd` public API.\r\nThis update is relatively minor, featuring only a few non-controversial newcomers.\r\n\r\n`ZSTD_defaultCLevel()` indicates which level is default (applied when selecting level `0`). It completes existing\r\n`ZSTD_minCLevel()` and `ZSTD_maxCLevel()`.\r\nSimilarly, `ZSTD_getDictID_fromCDict()` is a straightforward equivalent to already promoted `ZSTD_getDictID_fromDDict()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n[Zstd-1.4.0](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.4.0) stabilized a new [advanced API](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L238) which allows users to pass advanced parameters to zstd. We’re now deprecating all the old experimental APIs that are subsumed by the new advanced API. They will be considered for removal in the next Zstd major release zstd-1.6.0. Note that only experimental symbols are impacted. Stable functions, like `ZSTD_initCStream()`, remain fully supported.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated functions are listed below, together with the migration. All the suggested migrations are stable APIs, meaning that once you migrate, the API will be supported forever. See the documentation for the deprecated functions for more details on how to migrate.\r\n\r\n-   Functions that migrate to `ZSTD_compress2()` with parameter setters:\r\n    * `ZSTD_compress_advanced()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_setParameter()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L458-L469).\r\n    * `ZSTD_compress_usingCDict_advanced()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_setParameter()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L458-L469) and [`ZSTD_CCtx_refCDict()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L960-L972).\r\n-   Functions that migrate to `ZSTD_compressStream()` or `ZSTD_compressStream2()` with parameter setters:\r\n    * `ZSTD_initCStream_srcSize()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_setPledgedSrcSize()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L471-L486).\r\n    * `ZSTD_initCStream_usingDict()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_loadDictionary()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L941-L958).\r\n    * `ZSTD_initCStream_usingCDict()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_refCDict()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L960-L972).\r\n    * `ZSTD_initCStream_advanced()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_setParameter()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L458-L469).\r\n    * `ZSTD_initCStream_usingCDict_advanced()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_setParameter()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L458-L469) and [`ZSTD_CCtx_refCDict()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L960-L972).\r\n    * `ZSTD_resetCStream()`: Use [`ZSTD_CCtx_reset()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L494-L508) and [`ZSTD_CCtx_setPledgedSrcSize()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/705a62b612151cff06f453bc3452b9e99088a574/lib/zstd.h#L471-L486).\r\n-   Functions that are deprecated without replacement. We don’t expect any users of these functions. Please open an issue if you use these and have questions about how to migrate.\r\n    * `ZSTD_compressBegin_advanced()`\r\n    * `ZSTD_compressBegin_usingCDict_advanced()`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Header File Locations\r\n\r\nZstd has slightly re-organized the library layout to move all public headers to the top level `lib/` directory. This is for consistency, so all public headers are in `lib/` and all private headers are in a sub-directory. If you build zstd from source, this may affect your build system.\r\n-   `lib/common/zstd_errors.h` has moved to `lib/zstd_errors.h`.\r\n-   `lib/dictBuilder/zdict.h` has moved to `lib/zdict.h`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Single-File Library\r\n\r\nWe have moved the scripts in `contrib/single_file_libs` to `build/single_file_libs`. These scripts, originally contributed by @cwoffenden, produce a single compilation-unit amalgamation of the zstd library, which can be convenient for integrating Zstandard into other source trees. This move reflects a commitment on our part to support this tool and this pattern of using zstd going forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Windows Release Artifact Format\r\n\r\nWe are slightly changing the format of the Windows release `.zip` files, to match our other release artifacts. The `.zip` files now bundle everything in a single folder whose name matches the archive name. The contents of that folder exactly match what was previously included in the root of the archive.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Signed Releases\r\n\r\nWe have created a [signing key](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xEF8FE99528B52FFD) for the Zstandard project. This release and all future releases will be signed by this key. See #2520 for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n-   api: Various functions promoted from experimental to stable API:

is an incremental release which includes various improvements and bug-fixes.\r\n\r\n## >2x Faster Long Distance Mode\r\n\r\nLong Distance Mode (LDM) `--long` just got a whole lot faster thanks to optimizations by @mpu in #2483! These optimizations preserve the compression ratio but drastically speed up compression. It is especially noticeable in multithreaded mode, because the long distance match finder is not parallelized. Benchmarking with `zstd -T0 -1 --long=31` on an Intel I9-9900K at 3.2 GHz we see:\r\n\r\n|File |v1.4.8 MB/s  |v1.4.9 MB/s  |Improvement  |\r\n|---  |---  |---  |---  |\r\n|silesia.tar  |308  |692  |125% |\r\n|linux-versions*  |312  |667  |114% |\r\n|enwik9 |294  |747  |154% |\r\n\r\n\\* `linux-versions` is a concatenation of the linux 4.0, 5.0, and 5.10 git  archives.\r\n\r\n## New Experimental Decompression Feature: `ZSTD_d_refMultipleDDicts`\r\n\r\nIf the advanced parameter `ZSTD_d_refMultipleDDicts` is enabled, then multiple calls to `ZSTD_refDDict()` will be honored in the corresponding `DCtx`.  Example usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZSTD_DCtx* dctx = ZSTD_createDCtx();\r\nZSTD_DCtx_setParameter(dctx, ZSTD_d_refMultipleDDicts, ZSTD_rmd_refMultipleDDicts);\r\nZSTD_DCtx_refDDict(dctx, ddict1);\r\nZSTD_DCtx_refDDict(dctx, ddict2);\r\nZSTD_DCtx_refDDict(dctx, ddict3);\r\n...\r\nZSTD_decompress...\r\n```\r\n\r\nDecompression of multiple frames, each with their own `dictID`,  is now possible with a single `ZSTD_decompress` call. As long as the `dictID` from each frame header references one of the `dictID`s within the `DCtx`, then the corresponding dictionary will be used to decompress that particular frame. Note that this feature is disabled with a statically-allocated `DCtx`.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* bug: Use `umask()` to Constrain Created File Permissions (#2495, @felixhandte)\r\n* bug: Make Simple

: this version features a minor bug, which can be present on systems others than `x64` and `arm64`. Update `v1.4.8` is recommended for all other platforms.\r\n\r\n`v1.4.7` unleashes several months of improvements across many axis, from performance to various fixes, to new capabilities, of which a few are highlighted below. It’s a recommended upgrade.\r\n\r\n(Note: if you ever wondered what happened to `v1.4.6`, it’s an internal release number reserved for synchronization with Linux Kernel)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Improved `--long` mode\r\n\r\n`--long` mode makes it possible to analyze vast quantities of data in reasonable time and memory budget. The `--long` mode algorithm runs on top of the regular match finder, and both contribute to the final compressed outcome.\r\nHowever, the fact that these 2 stages were working independently resulted in minor discrepancies at highest compression levels, where the cost of each decision must be carefully monitored. For this reason, in situations where the input is not a good fit for `--long` mode (no large repetition at long distance), enabling it *could* reduce compression performance, even if by very little, compared to not enabling it (at high compression levels). This situation made it more difficult to \"just always enable\" the `--long` mode by default.\r\nThis is fixed in this version. For compression levels 16 and up, usage of  `--long` will now never regress compared to compression without `--long`. This property made it possible to ramp up `--long` mode contribution to the compression mix, improving its effectiveness. \r\n\r\nThe compression ratio improvements are most notable when `--long` mode is actually useful. In particular, `--patch-from` (which implicitly relies on `--long`) shows excellent gains from the improvements. We present some brief results [here](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/wiki/Zstandard-as-a-patching-engine) (tested on Macbook Pro 16“, i9).\r\n\r\n![long_v145_v147](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/750081/102455532-a05dbd00-3ff4-11eb-9abf-f997d6958f11.png)\r\n\r\nSince `--long` mode is now always beneficial at high compression levels, it’s now automatically enabled for any window size >= 128MB and up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Faster decompression of small blocks\r\n\r\nThis release includes optimizations that significantly speed up decompression of small blocks and small data. The decompression speed gains will vary based on the block size according to the table below:\r\n\r\nBlock Size | Decompression Speed Improvement\r\n-----------|--------------------------------\r\n 1 KB      | ~+30%\r\n 2 KB      | ~+30%\r\n 4 KB      | ~+25%\r\n 8 KB      | ~+15%\r\n16 KB      | ~+10%\r\n32 KB      |  ~+5%\r\n\r\nThese optimizations come from improving the process of reading the block header, and building the Huffman and FSE decoding tables. `zstd`’s default block size is 128 KB, and at this block size the time spent decompressing the data dominates the time spent reading the block header and building the decoding tables. But, as blocks become smaller, the cost of reading the block header and building decoding tables becomes more prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\n## CLI improvements\r\n\r\nThe CLI received several noticeable upgrades with this version.\r\nTo begin with, `zstd` can accept a new parameter through environment variable, `ZSTD_NBTHREADS` . It’s useful when `zstd` is called behind an application (`tar`, or a python script for example). Also, users which prefer multithreaded compression by default can now set a desired nb of threads with their environment. This setting can still be overridden on demand via command line.\r\nA new command `--output-dir-mirror` makes it possible to compress a directory containing subdirectories (typically with `-r` command) producing one compressed file per source file, and reproduce the arborescence into a selected destination directory.\r\nThere are other various improvements, such as more accurate warning and error messages, full equivalence between conventions `--long-command=FILE` and `--long-command FILE`, fixed confusion risks between `stdin` and user prompt, or between console output and status message, as well as a new short execution summary when processing multiple files, cumulatively contributing to a nicer command line experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New experimental features\r\n\r\n### Shared Thread Pool\r\n\r\nBy default, each compression context can be set to use a maximum nb of threads.\r\nIn complex scenarios, there might be multiple compression contexts, working in parallel, and each using some nb of threads. In such cases, it might be desirable to control the _total_ nb of threads used by _all_ these compression contexts altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is now possible, by making all these compression contexts share the same threadpool. This capability is expressed thanks to a new advanced compression parameter, ``ZSTD_CCtx_refThreadPool()``, contributed by @marxin. See its [documentation](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.4.7/lib/zstd.h#L1501) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Faster Dictionary Compression\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new experimental dictionary compression algorithm, applicable to mid-range compression levels, employing strategies such as `ZSTD_greedy`, `ZSTD_lazy`, and `ZSTD_lazy2`. This new algorithm can be triggered by selecting the compression parameter `ZSTD_c_enableDedicatedDictSearch` during `ZSTD_CDict` creation (experimental section).\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show the new algorithm providing significant compression speed gains :\r\n\r\nLevel | Hot Dict | Cold Dict\r\n----- | -------- | ---------\r\n5 | ~+17% | ~+30%\r\n6 | ~+12% | ~+45%\r\n7 | ~+13% | ~+40%\r\n8 | ~+16% | ~+50%\r\n9 | ~+19% | ~+65%\r\n10 | ~+24% | ~+70%\r\n\r\nWe hope it will help making mid-levels compression more attractive for dictionary scenarios. See [the documentation](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/9f8b180/lib/zstd.h#L1663-L1717) for more details. Feedback is welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Sequence Ingestion API\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new entry point, `ZSTD_compressSequences()`, which makes it possible for users to define their own sequences, by whatever mechanism they prefer, and present them to this new entry point, which will generate a single `zstd`-compressed frame, based on provided sequences.\r\n\r\nSo for example, users can now feed to the function an array of externally generated `ZSTD_Sequence`:\r\n `[(offset: 5, matchLength: 4, litLength: 10), (offset: 7, matchLength: 6, litLength: 3), ...]` and the function will output a zstd compressed frame based on these sequences.\r\n\r\nThis experimental API has currently several limitations (and its relevant params exist in the “experimental” section). Notably, this API currently ignores any repeat offsets provided, instead always recalculating them on the fly. Additionally, there is no way to forcibly specify existence of certain zstd features, such as RLE or raw blocks. \r\nIf you are interested in this new entry point, please refer to `zstd.h` for more detailed usage instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThere are many other features and improvements in this release, and since we can’t highlight them all, they are listed below:\r\n\r\n-

Zstd v1.4.5 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly important release which includes performance improvements and new major CLI features. It also fixes a few corner cases, making it a recommended upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Faster Decompression Speed\r\n\r\nDecompression speed has been improved again, thanks to great contributions from [@terrelln](https://github.com/terrelln).\r\nAs usual, exact mileage varies depending on files and compilers. \r\nFor `x64` cpus, expect a speed bump of at least +5%, and up to +10% in favorable cases.\r\n`ARM` cpus receive more benefit, with speed improvements ranging from +15% vicinity, and up to +50% for certain SoCs and scenarios (`ARM`‘s situation is more complex due to larger differences in SoC designs).\r\n\r\nFor illustration, some benchmarks run on a modern `x64` platform using `zstd -b` compiled with `gcc` v9.3.0 :\r\n\r\n|\t|v1.4.4\t|v1.4.5\t|\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\r\n|silesia.tar\t|1568 MB/s\t|1653 MB/s\t|\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\r\n|enwik8\t|1374 MB/s\t|1469 MB/s\t|\r\n|calgary.tar\t|1511 MB/s\t|1610 MB/s\t|\r\n\r\nSame platform, using `clang` v10.0.0 compiler :\r\n\r\n|\t|v1.4.4\t|v1.4.5\t|\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\r\n|silesia.tar\t|1439 MB/s\t|1496 MB/s\t|\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\r\n|enwik8\t|1232 MB/s\t|1335 MB/s\t|\r\n|calgary.tar\t|1361 MB/s\t|1457 MB/s\t|\r\n\r\n## Simplified integration\r\n\r\nPresuming a project needs to integrate `libzstd`'s *source code* (as opposed to linking a pre-compiled library), the `/lib` source directory can be copy/pasted into target project. Then the local build system must setup a few include directories. Some setups are automatically provided in prepared build scripts, such as `Makefile`, but any other 3rd party build system must do it on its own.\r\nThis integration is now simplified, thanks to @felixhandte, by making all dependencies within `/lib` relative, meaning it’s only necessary to setup include directories for the `*.h` header files that are directly included into target project (typically `zstd.h`).  Even that task can be circumvented by copy/pasting the `*.h` into already established include directories.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you are a fan of one-file integration strategy, @cwoffenden has extended his one-file decoder script into a full feature [one-file compression library](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/dev/contrib/single_file_libs). The script [`create_single_file_library.sh`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/contrib/single_file_libs/create_single_file_library.sh) will generate a file `zstd.c`, which contains all selected elements from the library (by default, compression and decompression). It’s then enough to import just `zstd.h` and the generated `zstd.c` into target project to access all included capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n## `--patch-from` \r\n\r\nZstandard CLI is introducing a new command line option `--patch-from`, which leverages existing compressors, dictionaries and long range match finder to deliver a high speed engine for producing and applying patches to files.\r\n\r\n`--patch-from` is based on dictionary compression. It will consider a previous version of a file as a dictionary, to better compress a new version of same file. This operation preserves fast `zstd` speeds at lower compression levels. To this ends, it also increases the previous maximum limit for dictionaries from 32 MB to 2 GB, and automatically uses the long range match finder when needed (though it can also be manually overruled).\r\n`--patch-from` can also be combined with multi-threading mode at a very minimal compression ratio loss.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# create the patch\r\nzstd --patch-from=<oldfile> <newfile> -o <patchfile>\r\n\r\n# apply the patch\r\nzstd -d --patch-from=<oldfile> <patchfile> -o <newfile>`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmarks:\r\nWe compared `zstd` to `bsdiff`, a popular industry grade diff engine. Our test corpus were tarballs of different versions of source code from popular GitHub repositories. Specifically:\r\n\r\n```\r\n`repos = {\r\n    # ~31mb (small file)\r\n    \"zstd\": {\"url\": \"https://github.com/facebook/zstd\", \"dict-branch\": \"refs/tags/v1.4.2\", \"src-branch\": \"refs/tags/v1.4.3\"},\r\n    # ~273mb (medium file)\r\n    \"wordpress\": {\"url\": \"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress\", \"dict-branch\": \"refs/tags/5.3.1\", \"src-branch\": \"refs/tags/5.3.2\"},\r\n    # ~1.66gb (large file)\r\n    \"llvm\": {\"url\": \"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project\", \"dict-branch\": \"refs/tags/llvmorg-9.0.0\", \"src-branch\": \"refs/tags/llvmorg-9.0.1\"}\r\n}`\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n`--patch-from` on level 19 (with chainLog=30 and targetLength=4kb) is comparable with `bsdiff` when comparing patch sizes.\r\n![patch-size-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/facebook/zstd/images/patch-size-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n `--patch-from` greatly outperforms `bsdiff` in speed even on its slowest setting of level 19 boasting an average speedup of ~7X. `--patch-from` is >200X faster on level 1 and >100X faster (shown below) on level 3 vs `bsdiff` while still delivering patch sizes less than 0.5% of the original file size.\r\n \r\n![speed-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/facebook/zstd/images/speed-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19.png)\r\n \r\n ![speed-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/facebook/zstd/images/speed-bsdiff-vs-zstd-19-1.png)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, there is no change to the fast zstd decompression speed.\r\n\r\n_Addendum_ : \r\n\r\nAfter releasing `--patch-from`, we were made aware of two other popular diff engines by the community: SmartVersion and Xdelta. We ran some additional benchmarks for them and here are our primary takeaways. All three tools are excellent diff engines with clear advantages (especially in speed) over the popular bsdiff. Patch sizes for both binary and text data produced by all three are pretty comparable with Xdelta underperforming Zstd and SmartVersion only slightly [1]. For patch creation speed, Xdelta is the clear winner for text data and Zstd is the clear winner for binary data [2]. And for Patch Extraction Speed (ie. decompression), Zstd is fastest in all scenarios [3]. See [wiki](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/wiki/PatchFrom#patchfrom-vs-smartversion-vs-xdelta-for-wiki) for details. \r\n\r\n## `--filelist=`\r\n\r\nFinally,  `--filelist=` is a new CLI capability, which makes it possible to pass a list of files to operate upon from a file,\r\nas opposed to listing all target files solely on the command line. \r\nThis makes it possible to prepare a list offline, save it into a file, and then provide the prepared list to `zstd`.\r\nAnother advantage is that this method circumvents command line size limitations, which can become a problem when operating on very large directories (such situation can typically happen with shell expansion).\r\nIn contrast, passing a very large list of filenames from within a file is free of such size limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n##

release includes some major performance improvements and new CLI features, which make it a recommended upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Faster Decompression Speed\r\n\r\nDecompression speed has been substantially improved, thanks to @terrelln. Exact mileage obviously varies depending on files and scenarios, but the general expectation is a bump of about +10%. The benefit is considered applicable to all scenarios, and will be perceptible for most usages.\r\n\r\nSome benchmark figures for illustration:\r\n\r\n|   | v1.4.3 | v1.4.4 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | \r\n| silesia.tar | 1440 MB/s | 1600 MB/s |\r\n| enwik8 | 1225 MB/s | 1390 MB/s |\r\n| calgary.tar | 1360 MB/s | 1530 MB/s |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Faster Compression Speed when Re-Using Contexts\r\n\r\nIn server workloads (characterized by very high compression volume of relatively small inputs), the allocation and initialization of `zstd`'s internal datastructures can become a significant part of the cost of compression. For this reason, `zstd` has long had an optimization (which we recommended for large-scale users, perhaps with something like [this](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/compression/CompressionContextPool.h)): when you provide an already-used `ZSTD_CCtx` to a compression operation, `zstd` tries to re-use the existing data structures, if possible, rather than re-allocate and re-initialize them.\r\n\r\nHistorically, this optimization could avoid re-allocation most of the time, but required an exact match of internal parameters to avoid re-initialization. In this release, @felixhandte removed the dependency on matching parameters, allowing the full context re-use optimization to be applied to effectively all compressions. Practical workloads on small data should expect a ~3% speed-up.\r\n\r\nIn addition to improving average performance, this change also has some nice side-effects on the extremes of performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* On the fast end, it is now easier to get optimal performance from `zstd`. In particular, it is no longer necessary to do careful tracking and matching of contexts to compressions based on detailed parameters (as discussed for example in #1796). Instead, straightforwardly reusing contexts is now optimal.\r\n* Second, this change ameliorates some rare, degenerate scenarios (e.g., high volume streaming compression of small inputs with varying, high compression levels), in which it was possible for the allocation and initialization work to vastly overshadow the actual compression work. These cases are up to 40x faster, and now perform in-line with similar happy cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dictionaries and Large Inputs\r\n\r\nIn theory, using a dictionary should always be beneficial. However, due to some long-standing implementation limitations, it can actually be detrimental. Case in point: by default, dictionaries are prepared to compress small data (where they are most useful). When this prepared dictionary is used to compress large data, there is a mismatch between the prepared parameters (targeting small data) and the ideal parameters (that would target large data). This can cause dictionaries to counter-intuitively result in a *lower* compression ratio when compressing large inputs.\r\n\r\nStarting with v1.4.4, using a dictionary with a very large input will no longer be detrimental. Thanks to a patch from @senhuang42, whenever the library notices that input is sufficiently large (relative to dictionary size), the dictionary is re-processed, using the optimal parameters for large data, resulting in improved compression ratio.\r\n\r\nThe capability is also exposed, and can be manually triggered using `ZSTD_dictForceLoad`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New commands\r\n\r\n`zstd` CLI extends its capabilities, providing new advanced commands, thanks to great contributions :\r\n\r\n* `zstd` generated files (compressed or decompressed) can now be automatically stored into a *different* directory than the source one, using `--output-dir-flat=DIR` command, provided by @senhuang42 .\r\n* It’s possible to inform `zstd` about the size of data coming from `stdin` . @nmagerko proposed 2 new commands, allowing users to provide the exact stream size (`--stream-size=#` ) or an approximative one (`--size-hint=#`).  Both only make sense when compressing a data stream from a pipe (such as `stdin`), since for a real file, `zstd` obtains the exact source size from the file system. Providing a source size allows `zstd` to better adapt internal compression parameters to the input, resulting in better performance and compression ratio. Additionally, providing the precise size makes it possible to embed this information in the compressed frame header, which also allows decoder optimizations.\r\n* In situations where the same directory content get regularly compressed, with the intention to only compress new files not yet compressed, it’s necessary to filter the file list, to exclude already compressed files. This process is simplified with command `--exclude-compressed`, provided by [@shashank0791](https://github.com/shashank0791) . As the name implies, it simply excludes all compressed files from the list to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Single-File Decoder with Web Assembly\r\n\r\nLet’s complete the picture with an impressive contribution from @cwoffenden. `libzstd` has long offered the capability to build only the decoder, in order to generate smaller binaries that can be more easily embedded into memory-constrained devices and applications.\r\n\r\n@cwoffenden built on this capability and offers a script creating a single-file decoder, as an amalgamated variant of reference Zstandard’s decoder. The package is completed with a nice build script, which compiles the one-file decoder into `WASM` code, for embedding into web application, and even tests it.\r\n\r\nAs a capability example, check out the awesome WebGL demo provided by @cwoffenden in `/contrib/single_file_decoder/examples` directory!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Full List\r\n\r\n- perf: Improved decompression speed, by > 10%, by

Maintenance\r\n\r\nThis release is primarily a maintenance release.\r\n\r\nIt includes a few bug fixes, including a fix for a rare data corruption bug, which could only be triggered in a niche use case, when doing all of the following: using multithreading mode, with an overlap size >= 512 MB, using a strategy >= `ZSTD_btlazy`, and compressing more than 4 GB. None of the default compression levels meet these requirements (not even `--ultra` ones).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nThis release also includes some performance improvements, among which the primary improvement is that Zstd decompression is ~7% faster, thanks to @mgrice.\r\n\r\nSee this comparison of decompression speeds at different compression levels, measured on the Silesia Corpus, on an Intel i9-9900K with GCC 9.1.0.\r\n\r\n| Level | v1.4.0 | v1.4.1 | Delta |\r\n| ---: | :---: | :---: | ---: |\r\n| 1 | 1390 MB/s | 1453 MB/s | +4.5% |\r\n| 3 | 1208 MB/s | 1301 MB/s | +7.6% |\r\n| 5

Advanced API\r\n\r\nThe main focus of the v1.4.0 release is the stabilization of the advanced API.\r\n\r\nThe advanced API provides a way to set specific parameters during compression and decompression in an API and ABI compatible way. For example, it allows you to compress with [multiple threads](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L349), enable [--long](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L311) mode, set [frame parameters](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L338), and [load dictionaries](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L873). It is compatible with `ZSTD_compressStream*()` and `ZSTD_compress2()`. There is also an advanced decompression API that allows you to set parameters like [maximum memory usage](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L490), and [load dictionaries](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L925). It is compatible with the existing decompression functions `ZSTD_decompressStream()` and `ZSTD_decompressDCtx()`.\r\n\r\nThe old streaming functions are all compatible with the new API, and the documentation provides the equivalent function calls in the new API. For example, see [`ZSTD_initCStream()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L677). The stable functions will remain supported, but the functions in the experimental sections, like [`ZSTD_initCStream_usingDict()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L1597), will eventually be marked as deprecated and removed in favor of the new advanced API.\r\n\r\nThe [examples](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/examples) have all been updated to use the new advanced API. If you have questions about how to use the new API, please refer to the examples, and if they are unanswered, please open an issue.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nZstd's fastest compression level just got faster! Thanks to ideas from Intel's [igzip](https://github.com/01org/isa-l/tree/master/igzip) and @gbtucker, we've made level 1, zstd's fastest strategy, 6-8% faster in most scenarios. For example on the [Silesia Corpus](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia) with level 1, we see 0.2% better compression compared to zstd-1.3.8, and these performance figures on an Intel i9-9900K:\r\n\r\nVersion | C. Speed | D. Speed\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n1.3.8 gcc-8 | 489 MB/s | 1343 MB/s\r\n1.4.0 gcc-8 | 532 MB/s (+8%) | 1346 MB/s\r\n1.3.8 clang-8 | 488 MB/s | 1188 MB/s\r\n1.4.0 clang-8 | 528 MB/s (+8%) | 1216 MB/s\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\nA new experimental function [`ZSTD_decompressBound()`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/a880ca239b447968493dd2fed3850e766d6305cc/lib/zstd.h#L1178) has been added by @shakeelrao. It is useful when decompressing zstd data in a single shot that may, or may not have the decompressed size written into the frame. It is exact when the decompressed size is written into the frame, and a tight upper bound within 128 KB, as long as `ZSTD_e_flush` and `ZSTD_flushStream()` aren't used. When `ZSTD_e_flush` is used, in the worst case the bound can be very large, but this isn't a common scenario.\r\n\r\nThe parameter `ZSTD_c_literalCompressionMode` and the CLI flag `--[no-]compress-literals` allow users to explicitly enable and disable literal compression. By default literals are compressed with positive compression levels, and left uncompressed for negative compression levels. Disabling literal compression boosts compression and decompression speed, at the cost of compression ratio.\r\n\r\n### Detailed list of changes\r\n\r\n* perf: Improve level 1 compression speed in most

Advanced API\r\n\r\n`v1.3.8` main focus is the stabilization of the [advanced API](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.8/lib/zstd.h#L419).\r\n\r\nThis API has been in the making for more than a year, and makes it possible to trigger advanced features, such as multithreading, `--long` mode, or detailed frame parameters, in a straightforward and extensible manner. Some examples are provided [in this blog entry](https://code.fb.com/core-data/zstandard/).\r\nTo make this vision possible, the advanced API relies on sticky parameters, which can be stacked on top of each other in any order. This makes it possible to introduce new features in the future without breaking API nor ABI. \r\n\r\nThis API has provided a good experience in our infrastructure, and we hope it will prove easy to use and efficient in your applications. Nonetheless, before being branded \"stable\", this proposal must spend a last round in \"staging area\", in order to generate comments and feedback from new users. It's planned to be labelled \"stable\" by `v1.4.0`, which is expected to be next release, depending on received feedback. \r\n\r\nThe experimental section still contains a lot of prototypes which are largely redundant with the new advanced API. Expect them to become deprecated, and then later dropped in some future. Transition towards the newer advanced API is therefore highly recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Performance\r\n\r\nDecoding speed has been improved again, primarily for some specific scenarios : frames using large window sizes (`--ultra` or `--long`), and cold dictionary. Cold dictionary is expected to become more important in the near future, as solutions relying on thousands of dictionaries simultaneously will be deployed.\r\n\r\nThe higher compression levels get a slight compression ratio boost, mostly visible for small (<256 KB) and large (>32 MB) data streams. This change benefits asymmetric scenarios (compress ones, decompress many times), typically targeting level 19.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\nA noticeable addition, @terrelln introduces the [`--rsyncable` mode](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.8/programs/zstd.1.md#operation-modifiers) to `zstd`. Similar to `gzip --rsyncable`, it generates a compressed frame which is friendly to `rsync` in case of limited changes : a difference in the input data will only impact a small localized amount of compressed data, instead of everything from the position onward due to cascading impacts. This is useful for very large archives regularly updated and synchronized over long distance connections (as an example, compressed mailboxes come to mind).\r\n\r\nThe method used by `zstd` preserves the compression ratio very well, introducing only very tiny losses due to synchronization points, meaning it's no longer a sacrifice to use `--rsyncable`. Here is an example on `silesia.tar`, using default compression level :\r\n\r\n| compressor | normal | `--rsyncable` | Ratio diff. | time |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| gzip | 68235456 | 68778265 | -0.795% | 7.92s |\r\n| zstd | 66829650 | 66846769 |  -0.026% | 1.17s |\r\n\r\nSpeaking of compression of level : it's now possible to use [environment variable `ZSTD_CLEVEL`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.8/programs/README.md#restricted-usage-of-environment-variables) to influence default compression level. This can prove useful in situations where it's not possible to provide command line parameters, typically when `zstd` is invoked \"under the hood\" by some calling process.\r\n\r\nLastly, anyone interested in embedding a small `zstd` decoder into a space-constrained application will be interested in a [new set of build macros](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/v1.3.8/lib#modular-build) introduced by @felixhandte, which makes it possible to selectively turn off decoder features to reduce binary size even further. Final binary size will of course vary depending on target assembler and compiler, but in preliminary testings on x64, it helped reducing the decoder size by a factor 3 (from ~64KB towards ~20KB).\r\n\r\n#### Detailed list of changes\r\n\r\n- perf: better decompression speed on large files (+7%) and cold dictionaries (+15%)\r\n- perf: slightly better compression ratio at high

is minor fix release building upon v1.3.6.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we publish this new version is that @indygreg detected an important compression ratio regression for a specific scenario (compressing with dictionary at level 9 or 10 for small data, or 11 - 12 for large data) . We don't anticipate this scenario to be common : dictionary compression is still rare, then most users prefer fast modes (levels <=3), a few rare ones use strong modes (level 15-19), so \"middle compression\" is an extreme rarity.\r\nBut just in case some user do, we publish this release.\r\n\r\nA few other minor things were ongoing and are therefore bundled.\r\n\r\nDecompression speed might be slightly better with `clang`, depending on exact target and version. We could observe as mush as 7% speed gains in some cases, though in other cases, it's rather in the ~2% range.\r\n\r\nThe integrated backtrace functionality in the cli is updated : its presence can be more easily controlled, invoking `BACKTRACE` build macro. The automatic detector is more restrictive, and release mode builds without it by default. We want to be sure the default `make` compiles without any issue on most platforms.\r\n\r\nFinally, the list of man pages has been completed with documentation for `zstdless` and `zstdgrep`, by @samrussell .\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Detailed list of changes\r\n\r\n- perf: slightly better decompression speed on clang (depending on hardware target)\r\n- fix : ratio for dictionary compression at levels 9 and 10, reported by @indygreg \r\n- build: no longer build backtrace by default in release mode; restrict further automatic mode\r\n- build: control backtrace support through build macro BACKTRACE\r\n- misc: added man pages for zstdless and zstdgrep, by

v1.3.6 release is focused on intensive dictionary compression for database scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis is a new environment we are experimenting. The success of dictionary compression on small data, of which databases tend to store plentiful, led to increased adoption, and we now see scenarios where literally thousands of dictionaries are being used simultaneously, with permanent generation or update of new dictionaries.\r\n\r\nTo face these new conditions, v1.3.6 brings a few improvements to the table : \r\n\r\n- A brand new, faster dictionary builder, by @jenniferliu, under guidance from @terrelln. The new builder, named _fastcover_, is about 10x faster than our previous default generator, cover, while suffering only negligible accuracy losses (<1%). It's effectively an approximative version of cover, which throws away accuracy for the benefit of speed and memory. The new dictionary builder is so effective that it has become our new default dictionary builder (`--train`). Slower but higher quality generator remains accessible using `--train-cover` command.\r\n\r\nHere is an example, using the \"github user records\" public dataset (about 10K records of about 1K each) : \r\n\r\n| builder algorithm |  generation time | compression ratio |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| fast cover (v1.3.6 `--train`) | 0.9 s | x10.29 |\r\n| cover (v1.3.5 `--train`) | 10.1 s | x10.31\r\n| High accuracy fast cover (`--train-fastcover`) | 6.6 s | x10.65\r\n| High accuracy cover (`--train-cover`) | 50.5 s | x10.66\r\n\r\n- Faster dictionary decompression under memory pressure, when using thousands of dictionaries simultaneously. The new decoder is able to detect cold vs hot dictionary scenarios, and adds clever prefetching decisions to minimize memory latency. It typically improves decoding speed by ~+30% (vs v1.3.5).\r\n\r\n- Faster dictionary compression under memory pressure, when using a lot of contexts simultaneously. The new design, by @felixhandte, reduces considerably memory usage when compressing small data with dictionaries, which is the main scenario found in databases. The sharp memory usage reduction makes it easier for CPU caches to manages multiple contexts in parallel. Speed gains scale with number of active contexts, as shown in the graph below :  \r\n       ![Dictionary compression : Speed vs Nb Active Contexts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/zstd/dev/doc/images/cdict_v136.png  \"Dictionary Compression Speed Improvements when multiple contexts are active\")\r\n\r\n  Note that, in real-life environment, benefits are present even faster, since cpu caches tend to be used by multiple other process / threads at the same time, instead of being monopolized by a single synthetic benchmark.\r\n\r\n#### Other noticeable improvements\r\n\r\nA new command `--adapt`, makes it possible to pipe gigantic amount of data between servers (typically for backup scenarios), and let the compressor automatically adjust compression level based on perceived network conditions. When the network becomes slower, `zstd` will use available time to compress more, and accelerate again when bandwidth permit. It reduces the need to \"pre-calibrate\" speed and compression level, and is a good simplification for system administrators. It also results in gains for both dimensions (better compression ratio _and_ better speed) compared to the more traditional \"fixed\" compression level strategy.\r\nThis is still early days for this feature, and we are eager to get feedback on its usages. We know it works better in fast bandwidth environments for example, as adaptation itself becomes slow when bandwidth is slow. This is something that will need to be improved. Nonetheless, in its current incarnation, `--adapt` already proves useful for several datacenter scenarios, which is why we are releasing it.\r\n\r\nAdvanced users will be please by the expansion of an existing tool, `tests/paramgrill`, which has been refined by @georgelu. This tool explores the space of [advanced compression parameters](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.6/programs/zstd.1.md#advanced-compression-options), to find the best possible set of compression parameters for a given scenario. It takes as input a set of samples, and a set of constraints, and works its way towards better and better compression parameters respecting the constraints.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n```\r\n./paramgrill --optimize=cSpeed=50M dirToSamples/*   # requires minimum compression speed of 50 MB/s\r\noptimizing for dirToSamples/* - limit compression speed 50 MB/s\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\n/*   Level  5   */       { 20, 18, 18,  2,  5,  2,ZSTD_greedy  ,  0 },     /* R:3.147 at  75.7 MB/s - 567.5 MB/s */   # best level satisfying constraint\r\n--zstd=windowLog=20,chainLog=18,hashLog=18,searchLog=2,searchLength=5,targetLength=2,strategy=3,forceAttachDict=0\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\n/* Custom Level */       { 21, 16, 18,  2,  6,  0,ZSTD_lazy2   ,  0 },     /* R:3.240 at  53.1 MB/s - 661.1 MB/s */  # best custom parameters found\r\n--zstd=windowLog=21,chainLog=16,hashLog=18,searchLog=2,searchLength=6,targetLength=0,strategy=5,forceAttachDict=0   # associated command arguments, can be copy/pasted for `zstd`\r\n```  \r\n\r\nFinally, documentation has been updated, to reflect wording adopted by [IETF RFC 8478 (_Zstandard Compression and the application/zstd Media Type_)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8478).\r\n\r\n### Detailed changes list\r\n\r\n- perf: much faster dictionary builder, by @jenniferliu\r\n- perf: faster dictionary compression on small data when using multiple contexts, by @felixhandte\r\n- perf: faster dictionary decompression when using a very large number of dictionaries simultaneously\r\n- cli : fix : does no longer overwrite destination when source does not exist (#1082)\r\n- cli : new command `--adapt`, for automatic compression level adaptation\r\n- api : fix : block api can be streamed with > 4 GB, reported by @catid\r\n- api : reduced `ZSTD_DDict` size by 2 KB\r\n- api : minimum negative compression level is defined, and can be queried using `ZSTD_minCLevel()` (#1312).\r\n- build: support Haiku target, by @korli\r\n- build: Read Legacy support is now limited to v0.5+ by default.

v1.3.5 is a maintenance release focused on dictionary compression performance.\r\n\r\nCompression is generally associated with the act of willingly requesting the compression of some large source. However, within datacenters, compression brings its best benefits when completed transparently. In such scenario, it's actually very common to compress a large number of very small blobs (individual messages in a stream or log, or records in a cache or datastore, etc.). Dictionary compression is a great tool for these use cases.\r\n\r\nThis release makes dictionary compression significantly faster for these situations, when compressing small to very small data (inputs up to ~16 KB).\r\n\r\n![Dictionary compression : speed vs input size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/zstd/master/doc/images/zstd_cdict_v1_3_5.png  \"Dictionary Compression Speed Improvements, levels 1, 3, 9 and 18\")\r\n\r\nThe above image plots the compression speeds at different input sizes for `zstd` v1.3.4 (red) and v1.3.5 (green), at levels 1, 3, 9, and 18.\r\nThe benchmark data was gathered on an `Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz`. The benchmark was compiled with `clang-7.0`, with the flags `-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -DNDEBUG`. The file used in the results shown here is the `osdb` file from the Silesia corpus, cut into small blocks. It was selected because it performed roughly in the middle of the pack among the Silesia files.\r\n\r\nThe new version saves substantial initialization time, which is increasingly important as the average size to compress becomes smaller. The impact is even more perceptible at higher levels, where initialization costs are higher. For larger inputs, performance remain similar.\r\n\r\nUsers can expect to measure substantial speed improvements for inputs smaller than 8 KB, and up to 32 KB depending on the context. The expected speed-up ranges from none (large, incompressible blobs) to many times faster (small, highly compressible inputs). Real world examples up to 15x have been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Other noticeable improvements\r\n\r\nThe compression levels have been slightly adjusted, taking into consideration the higher top speed of level 1 since v1.3.4, and making level 19 a substantially stronger compression level while preserving the `8 MB` window size limit, hence keeping an acceptable memory budget for decompression.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to select the content of `libzstd` by [modifying macro values](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/v1.3.5/lib#modular-build) at compilation time. By default, `libzstd` contains everything, but its size can be made substantially smaller by removing support for the dictionary builder, or legacy formats, or deprecated functions. It's even possible to build a compression-only or a decompression-only library.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Detailed changes list\r\n\r\n- perf: much faster dictionary compression, by @felixhandte\r\n- perf:

v1.3.4 release of Zstandard is focused on performance, and offers nice speed boost in most scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous compression by default for `zstd` CLI\r\n\r\n`zstd` cli will now performs compression in parallel with I/O operations by default. This requires multi-threading capability (which is also enabled by default).\r\nIt doesn't sound like much, but effectively improves throughput by 20-30%, depending on compression level and underlying I/O performance.\r\n\r\nFor example, on a Mac OS-X laptop with an Intel Core i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz, running `time zstd ` [`enwik9`](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html) at default compression level (2) on a SSD gives the following : \r\n\r\n| Version               | real time |\r\n| ---                   | --- |\r\n| 1.3.3                 | 9.2s |\r\n| 1.3.4 --single-thread | 8.8s |\r\n| 1.3.4 (asynchronous)  | 7.5s |\r\n\r\nThis is a nice boost to all scripts using `zstd` cli, typically in network or storage tasks. The effect is even more pronounced at faster compression setting, since the CLI overlaps a proportionally higher share of compression with I/O.\r\n\r\nPrevious default behavior (blocking single thread) is still available, accessible through `--single-thread` long command. It's also the only mode available when no multi-threading capability is detected.\r\n\r\n### General speed improvements\r\n\r\nSome core routines have been refined to provide more speed on newer cpus, making better use of their out-of-order execution units. This is more sensible on the decompression side, and even more so with `gcc` compiler.\r\n\r\nExample on the same platform, running in-memory benchmark `zstd -b1 silesia.tar` :\r\n\r\n| Version      | C.Speed | D.Speed |\r\n| ---          | ---- |  --- |\r\n| 1.3.3 llvm9  | 290 MB/s | 660 MB/s |\r\n| 1.3.4 llvm9  | 304 MB/s | 700 MB/s (+6%) |\r\n| 1.3.3 gcc7   | 280 MB/s | 710 MB/s\r\n| 1.3.4 gcc7   | 300 MB/s | 890 MB/s (+25%)|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Faster compression levels\r\n\r\nSo far, compression level 1 has been the fastest one available. Starting with v1.3.4, there will be additional choices. Faster compression levels can be invoked using negative values.\r\nOn the command line, the equivalent one can be triggered using `--fast[=#]` command.\r\n\r\nNegative compression levels sample data more sparsely, and disable Huffman compression of literals, translating into faster decoding speed.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to create one's own custom fast compression level\r\nby using strategy `ZSTD_fast`, increasing `ZSTD_p_targetLength` to desired value,\r\nand turning on or off literals compression, using `ZSTD_p_compressLiterals`.\r\n\r\nPerformance is generally on par or better than other high speed algorithms. On below benchmark (compressing `silesia.tar` on an Intel Core i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz) , it ends up being faster and stronger on all metrics compared with `quicklz` and `snappy` at `--fast=2`. It also compares favorably to `lzo` with `--fast=3`. `lz4` still offers a better speed / compression combo, with `zstd --fast=4` approaching close.\r\n\r\nname | ratio | compression | decompression\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nzstd 1.3.4 --fast=5 | 1.996 | 770 MB/s | 2060 MB/s\r\nlz4 1.8.1 | 2.101 | 750 MB/s | 3700 MB/s\r\nzstd 1.3.4 --fast=4 | 2.068 | 720 MB/s | 2000 MB/s\r\nzstd 1.3.4 --fast=3 | 2.153 | 675 MB/s | 1930 MB/s\r\nlzo1x 2.09 -1 | 2.108 | 640 MB/s | 810 MB/s\r\nzstd 1.3.4 --fast=2 | 2.265 | 610 MB/s | 1830 MB/s\r\nquicklz 1.5.0 -1 | 2.238 | 540 MB/s | 720 MB/s\r\nsnappy 1.1.4 | 2.091 | 530 MB/s | 1820 MB/s\r\nzstd 1.3.4 --fast=1 | 2.431 | 530 MB/s | 1770 MB/s\r\nzstd 1.3.4 -1 | 2.877 | 470 MB/s | 1380 MB/s\r\nbrotli 1.0.2 -0 | 2.701 | 410 MB/s | 430 MB/s\r\nlzf 3.6 -1 | 2.077 | 400 MB/s | 860 MB/s\r\nzlib 1.2.11 -1 | 2.743 | 110 MB/s | 400 MB/s\r\n\r\nApplications which were considering Zstandard but were worried of being CPU-bounded are now able to shift the load from CPU to bandwidth on a larger scale, and may even vary temporarily their choice depending on local conditions (to deal with some sudden workload surge for example).\r\n\r\n### Long Range Mode with Multi-threading\r\n\r\nzstd-1.3.2 introduced the [long range mode](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.2), capable to deduplicate long distance redundancies in a large data stream, a situation typical in backup scenarios for example. But its usage in association with multi-threading was discouraged, due to inefficient use of memory.\r\nzstd-1.3.4 solves this issue, by making long range match finder run in serial mode, like a pre-processor, before passing its result to backend compressors (regular zstd). Memory usage is now bounded to the maximum of the long range window size, and the memory that zstdmt would require without long range matching. As the long range mode runs at about 200 MB/s, depending on the number of cores available, it's possible to tune compression level to match the LRM speed, which becomes the upper limit.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nzstd -T0  -5  --long    file # autodetect threads, level 5, 128 MB window\r\nzstd -T16 -10 --long=31 file # 16 threads, level 10, 2 GB window\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs illustration, benchmarks of the two files \"Linux 4.7 - 4.12\" and \"Linux git\" from the [1.3.2 release](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.2) are shown below. All compressors are run with 16 threads, except \"zstd single 2 GB\". `zstd` compressors are run with either a 128 MB or 2 GB window size, and `lrzip` compressor is run with `lzo`, `gzip`, and `xz` backends. The benchmarks were run on a 16 core Sandy Bridge @ 2.2 GHz.\r\n\r\n![Linux 4.7 - 12 compression ratio vs speed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/zstd/v1.3.4/doc/images/linux-4.7-12-mt-compress.png \"Linux 4.7 - 12 compression ratio vs speed\")\r\n![Linux git compression ratio vs speed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/zstd/v1.3.4/doc/images/linux-git-mt-compress.png \"Linux git compression ratio vs speed\")\r\n\r\nThe association of Long Range Mode with multi-threading is pretty compelling for large stream scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThis release also brings its usual list of small improvements and bug fixes, as detailed below

Zstandard Long Range Match Finder\r\n\r\nZstandard has a new long range match finder written by Facebook's intern Stella Lau (@stellamplau), which specializes on finding long matches in the distant past. It integrates seamlessly with the regular compressor, and the output can be decompressed just like any other Zstandard compressed data.\r\n\r\nThe long range match finder adds minimal overhead to the compressor, works with any compression level, and maintains Zstandard's blazingly fast decompression speed. However, since the window size is larger, it requires more memory for compression and decompression.\r\n\r\nTo go along with the long range match finder, we've increased the maximum window size to 2 GB. The decompressor only accepts window sizes up to 128 MB by default, but `zstd -d --memory=2GB` will decompress window sizes up to 2 GB.\r\n\r\n## Example usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n# 128 MB window size\r\nzstd -1 --long file\r\nzstd -d file.zst\r\n\r\n# 2 GB window size (window log = 31)\r\nzstd -6 --long=31 file\r\nzstd -d --long=31 file.zst\r\n# OR\r\nzstd -d --memory=2GB file.zst\r\n```\r\n\r\n```c\r\nZSTD_CCtx *cctx = ZSTD_createCCtx();\r\nZSTD_CCtx_setParameter(cctx, ZSTD_p_compressionLevel, 19);\r\nZSTD_CCtx_setParameter(cctx, ZSTD_p_enableLongDistanceMatching, 1); // Sets windowLog=27\r\nZSTD_CCtx_setParameter(cctx, ZSTD_p_windowLog, 30); // Optionally increase the window log\r\nZSTD_compress_generic(cctx, &out, &in, ZSTD_e_end);\r\n\r\nZSTD_DCtx *dctx = ZSTD_createDCtx();\r\nZSTD_DCtx_setMaxWindowSize(dctx, 1 << 30);\r\nZSTD_decompress_generic(dctx, &out, &in);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nWe compared the zstd long range matcher to zstd and [lrzip](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip). The benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 1800X (8 cores with 16 threads at 3.6 GHz).\r\n\r\n### Compressors\r\n\r\n* zstd — The regular Zstandard compressor.\r\n* zstd 128 MB — The Zstandard compressor with a 128 MB window size.\r\n* zstd 2 GB — The Zstandard compressor with a 2 GB window size.\r\n* lrzip xz — The lrzip compressor with default options, which uses the xz backend at level 7 with 16 threads.\r\n* lrzip xz single — The lrzip compressor with a single-threaded xz backend at level 7.\r\n* lrzip zstd — The lrzip compressor without a backend, then its output is compressed by zstd (not multithreaded).\r\n\r\n### Files\r\n\r\n* Linux 4.7 - 4.12 — This file consists of the uncompressed tarballs of the six Linux kernel release from 4.7 to 4.12 concatenated together in order. This file is extremely compressible if the compressor can match against the previous versions well.\r\n* Linux git — This file is a tarball of the linux repo, created by `git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux && tar -cf linux-git.tar linux/`. This file gets a small benefit from long range matching. This file shows how the long range matcher performs when there isn't too many matches to find.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nBoth zstd and zstd 128 MB don't have large enough of a window size to compress Linux 4.7 - 4.12 well. zstd 2 GB compresses the fastest, and slightly better than lrzip-zstd. lrzip-xz compresses the best, and at a reasonable speed with multithreading enabled. The place where zstd shines is decompression ease and speed. Since it is just regular Zstandard compressed data, it is decompressed by the highly optimized decompressor.\r\n\r\nThe Linux git file shows that the long range matcher maintains good compression and decompression speed, even when there are far less long range matches. The decompression speed takes a small hit because it has to look further back to reconstruct the matches.\r\n\r\nCompression Ratio vs Speed | Decompression Speed\r\n---------------------------|--------------------\r\n![Linux 4.7 - 12 compression ratio vs speed](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/6d8778d8e7af50f0a7055d239df796e34f188239/doc/images/linux-4.7-12-compress.png \"Linux 4.7 - 12 compression ratio vs speed\") | ![Linux 4.7 - 12 decompression speed](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/6d8778d8e7af50f0a7055d239df796e34f188239/doc/images/linux-4.7-12-decompress.png \"Linux 4.7 - 12 decompression speed\")\r\n![Linux git compression ratio vs speed](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/6d8778d8e7af50f0a7055d239df796e34f188239/doc/images/linux-git-compress.png \"Linux git compression ratio vs speed\") | ![Linux git decompression speed](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/6d8778d8e7af50f0a7055d239df796e34f188239/doc/images/linux-git-decompress.png \"Linux git decompression speed\")\r\n\r\n## Implementation details \r\n\r\nThe long distance match finder was inspired by great work from Con Kolivas' [lrzip](http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/lrzip/README.md), which in turn was inspired by Andrew Tridgell's [rzip](https://rzip.samba.org/). Also, let's mention Bulat Ziganshin's [srep](https://encode.ru/threads/43-FreeArc?highlight=srep), which we have not been able to test unfortunately (site down), but the discussions on [encode.ru](https://encode.ru/forums/2-Data-Compression) proved great sources of inspiration.\r\n\r\nTherefore, many similar mechanisms are adopted, such as using a [rolling hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash), and filling a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) divided into buckets of entries.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we also made different choices, with the goal to favor speed, as can be observed in benchmark. The rolling hash formula is selected for computing efficiency. There is a restrictive insertion policy, which only inserts candidates that respect a mask condition. The insertion policy allows us to skip the hash table in the common case that a match isn't present. Confirmation bits are saved, to only check for matches when there is a strong presumption of success. These and a few more details add up to make zstd's long range matcher a speed-oriented implementation.\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference though is that the long range matcher is blended into the regular compressor, producing a single valid zstd frame, undistinguishable from normal operation (except obviously for the larger window size). This makes decompression a single pass process, preserving its speed property.\r\n\r\nMore details are available directly in source code, at [lib/compress/zstd_ldm.c](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/master/lib/compress/zstd_ldm.c).\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nThis is a first implementation, and it still has a few limitations, that we plan to lift in the future.\r\n\r\nThe long range matcher doesn't interact well with multithreading. Due to the way zstd multithreading is currently implemented, memory usage will scale with the window size times the number of threads, which is a problem for large window sizes. We plan on supporting multithreaded long range matching with reasonable memory usage in a future version.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Zstandard is currently limited to a 2 GB window size because of indexer's design. While this is a significant update compared to previous 128 MB limit, we believe this limitation can be lifted altogether, with some structural changes in the indexer. However, it also means that window size would become really big, with knock-off consequences on memory usage. So, to reduce this load, we will have to consider memory map as a complementary way to reference past content in the uncompressed file.\r\n\r\n# Detailed list of changes \r\n\r\n- new : __long range mode__, using `--long` command, by Stella Lau (@stellamplau)\r\n- new : ability to generate and decode magicless frames (#591)\r\n- changed : maximum nb of threads reduced to 200, to avoid address space exhaustion in 32-bits mode\r\n- fix : multi-threading compression works with custom allocators, by @terrelln \r\n- fix : a rare compression bug when compression generates very large distances and bunch of other conditions (only possible at `--ultra -22`)\r\n- fix : 32-bits build can now decode large offsets (levels 21+)\r\n- cli : added LZ4 frame support by default, by Felix Handte (@felixhandte)\r\n- cli : improved `--list` output\r\n- cli : new : can split input file for dictionary training, using command `-B#`\r\n- cli : new : clean operation artefact on Ctrl-C interruption (#854)\r\n- cli : fix : do not change /dev/null permissions when using command `-t` with root access, reported by @mike155 (#851)\r\n- cli : fix : write file size in header in multiple-files mode\r\n- api : added macro `ZSTD_COMPRESSBOUND()` for static allocation\r\n- api : experimental : new advanced decompression API\r\n- api : fix : `sizeof_CCtx()` used to over-estimate\r\n- build: fix : compilation works with `-mbmi` (#868)\r\n- build: fix : no-multithread variant compiles without `pool.c` dependency, reported by Mitchell Blank Jr (@mitchblank) (#819)\r\n- build: better compatibility with reproducible builds, by Bernhard M.
