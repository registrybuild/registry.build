Struct Members: `ImPlot3DPoint`, `ImPlot3DRange`, `ImPlot3DQuat`, `ImPlot3DTick::PlotPos`, `ImPlot3DAxis::NDCScale`.\r\n - Draw List: `ImDrawList3D::ZBuffer` and `ImDrawList3D::_ZWritePtr` are now using `double`.\r\n - Functions: `SetupBoxRotation`, `SetupBoxInitialRotation`, `SetupBoxScale`, and `PlotText` now accept `double` parameters.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the functions `GetPlotPos()` and `GetPlotSize()` have been renamed to `GetPlotRectPos()` and `GetPlotRectSize()` for clarity within the 3D context. The old functions are now deprecated and will be removed in future versions.\r\n\r\nSee `implot3d.cpp` for the full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### 🎉 New Contributors\r\n* @RT2Code made their first contribution in https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/pull/69\r\n* @micb25 made their first contribution in https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/pull/73\r\n* @adamsepp made their first contribution in https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/pull/75\r\n* @ACvanWyk made their first contribution in https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/pull/125\r\n* @chrissanrow made their first contribution in https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/pull/153\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/compare/v0.2...v0.3","discussion_url":"https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/discussions/157","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/releases/266047888/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":16},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/releases/200565191","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/releases/200565191/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/releases/200565191/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d/releases/tag/v0.2","id":200565191,"author":{"login":"brenocq","id":17342434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzQyNDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17342434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq","html_url":"https://github.com/brenocq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brenocq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDONQXA0M4L9GHH","tag_name":"v0.2","target_commitish":"main","name":"v0.2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2025-02-16T07:28:57Z","updated_at":"2025-02-16T09:31:02Z","published_at":"2025-02-16T09:31:02Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/tarball/v0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brenocq/implot3d/zipball/v0.2","body":"After nearly two months of work, I’m excited to release **ImPlot3D v0.2** 🎉!

While it already supports interactive 3D plotting, this release is just the beginning.\r\n\r\n### 🚀 Features\r\n- Core 3D Plotting Functions:\r\n  - `PlotScatter`: Plot individual 3D points.\r\n  - `PlotLine`: Draw lines in 3D space.\r\n  - `PlotTriangle`: Render triangles with fill support.\r\n  - `PlotQuad`: Render quads (two triangles) for surfaces.\r\n  - `PlotSurface`: Plot structured surfaces with X/Y grids.\r\n  - `PlotMesh`: Display custom meshes using vertices and indices.\r\n  - `PlotText`: Annotate your 3D plots with centered text labels.\r\n- Interactivity:\r\n  - Rotate, pan, and zoom plots using the mouse or touchpad.\r\n  - Reset the camera view with double-click interactions.\r\n  - Smooth camera rotation animations.\r\n- Customization:\r\n  - Control line styles, colors, and marker styles.\r\n  - Apply colormaps to surfaces, lines, and markers.\r\n  - Flexible axis setup with SetupAxes and SetupAxesLimits.\r\n\r\n### ⚠️ Your Feedback Matters!\r\nThis is **v0.1**, the very first step for ImPlot3D, and it’s far from perfect. Your input will shape its future! Whether you find bugs 🐞, think of missing features 💡, or create something amazing with it 🎨 — I want to hear from you.\r\n- 🐞 Spotted a bug?
