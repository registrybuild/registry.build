beta release of OSQP v1.0\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n\r\n* Introduced new linear algebra backend system allowing compute framework to be changed at compile time.\r\n* Merged cuOSQP project into main OSQP project (inside algebra/cuda directory).\r\n* Introduced an Intel MKL-based algebra backend using the MKL sparse BLAS API, Vector Math Library. This backend contains both the Pardiso solver and an RCI conjugate gradient implementation.\r\n* Added code generation capabilities to the C-level API (note, only problem export is in the C API, no file copying is done).\r\n* Added initial adjoint derivative computation to the C-level API.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n* Updated QDLDL to 0.1.7.\r\n* Changed QDLDL to be included through CMake FetchContent instead of a git submodule.\r\n* The MKL Pardiso solver is only available with the MKL backend.\r\n* CMake installs CMake config files for consuming applications to use.\r\n* All of OSQP's API is contained inside the public include files (there should be no need for users to include anything in private).\r\n* All OSQP functions, defines and types are prefixed with OSQP (in some capitalization) to namespace the API.\r\n\r\nDeveloper-centric changes:\r\n\r\n* Test suite switched to Catch2 and now incorporates modern C++ for memory management and organization.\r\n* ASAN flags integrated into main OSQP CMake build system.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/105454793/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/tag/v0.6.3","id":104276058,"author":{"login":"imciner2","id":2262453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2","html_url":"https://github.com/imciner2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBCGlZM4GNyBa","tag_name":"v0.6.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.6.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-05-25T14:48:50Z","published_at":"2023-05-25T14:52:21Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783481","id":109783481,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4Giym5","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-Linux.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":128606,"download_count":1796,"created_at":"2023-05-25T14:59:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T14:59:00Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.6.3/osqp-v0.6.3-Linux.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783629","id":109783629,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4GiypN","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-macOS.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":121563,"download_count":69,"created_at":"2023-05-25T15:00:26Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T15:00:26Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.6.3/osqp-v0.6.3-macOS.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783483","id":109783483,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4Giym7","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-src.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Q

[bintray.com](https://bintray.com/bstellato/generic/OSQP)\r\n*   Added inaccurate return statuses\r\n*   Added new object-oriented structure for linear system solvers\r\n*   Added MKL Pardiso interface using shared dynamic library loader\r\n*   Added diagonal `rho` vector with different values for equality/inequality constraints (interface still has scalar `rho`)\r\n*   OSQP returns certificates of infeasibility\r\n*   Code generation now produces also a static library\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/7844470","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/7844470/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/7844470/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/tag/v0.1.3","id":7844470,"author":{"login":"bstellato","id":5514200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTQyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5514200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato","html_url":"https://github.com/bstellato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTc4NDQ0NzA=","tag_name":"v0.1.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.1.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-09-21T18:50:23Z","published_at":"2017-09-21T19:53:53Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/4881464","id":4881464,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDQ4ODE0NjQ=","name":"install_osqp.m","label":"","uploader":{"login":"bstellato","id":5514200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTQyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5514200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato","html_url":"https://github.com/bstellato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":878,"download_count":35,"created_at":"2017-09-21T19:57:04Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T19:57:04Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.1.3/install_osqp.m"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/4881554","id":4881554,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDQ4ODE1NTQ=","name":"osqp-0.1.3-matlab-linux.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"bstellato","id":5514200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTQyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5514200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato","html_url":"https://github.com/bstellato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":96022,"download_count":23,"created_at":"2017-09-21T20:08:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T20:08:11Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.1.3/osqp-0.1.3-matlab-linux.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/4881463","id":4881463,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDQ4ODE0NjM=","name":"osqp-0.1.3-matlab-mac.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"bstellato","id":5514200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTQyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5514200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato","html_url":"https://github.com/bstellato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstellato/starred{/ow
