project (inside algebra/cuda directory).\r\n* Introduced an Intel MKL-based algebra backend using the MKL sparse BLAS API, Vector Math Library. This backend contains both the Pardiso solver and an RCI conjugate gradient implementation.\r\n* Added code generation capabilities to the C-level API (note, only problem export is in the C API, no file copying is done).\r\n* Added initial adjoint derivative computation to the C-level API.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n* Updated QDLDL to 0.1.7.\r\n* Changed QDLDL to be included through CMake FetchContent instead of a git submodule.\r\n* The MKL Pardiso solver is only available with the MKL backend.\r\n* CMake installs CMake config files for consuming applications to use.\r\n* All of OSQP's API is contained inside the public include files (there should be no need for users to include anything in private).\r\n* All OSQP functions, defines and types are prefixed with OSQP (in some capitalization) to namespace the API.\r\n\r\nDeveloper-centric changes:\r\n\r\n* Test suite switched to Catch2 and now incorporates modern C++ for memory management and organization.\r\n* ASAN flags integrated into main OSQP CMake build system.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/105454793/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/104276058/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/tag/v0.6.3","id":104276058,"author":{"login":"imciner2","id":2262453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2","html_url":"https://github.com/imciner2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imciner2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBCGlZM4GNyBa","tag_name":"v0.6.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.6.3","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-05-25T14:48:50Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T15:00:26Z","published_at":"2023-05-25T14:52:21Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783481","id":109783481,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4Giym5","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-Linux.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":128606,"digest":null,"download_count":2368,"created_at":"2023-05-25T14:59:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T14:59:00Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.6.3/osqp-v0.6.3-Linux.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783629","id":109783629,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4GiypN","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-macOS.tar.gz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":121563,"digest":null,"download_count":83,"created_at":"2023-05-25T15:00:26Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T15:00:26Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.6.3/osqp-v0.6.3-macOS.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osqp/osqp/releases/assets/109783483","id":109783483,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBCGlZM4Giym7","name":"osqp-v0.6.3-src.tar.gz","
