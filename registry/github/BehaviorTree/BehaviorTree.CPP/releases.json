This is a non comprehensive list.\r\n\r\nWith my great surprise, this release seems to be ABI compatible with 4.5.2\r\n\r\n## Default behavior of ReactiveSequence and ReactiveFallback\r\n\r\n**ReactiveSequence** and **ReactiveFallback** are unfortunately hard to use correctly.\r\nThere was a long discussion about what should happen when one of these nodes has multiple asynchronous children and there is no easy answer.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior is not more similar to version 3.8, but this also means that users must be very careful.\r\nRead this issue for details: https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/755\r\n\r\n## The \"global blackboard\" idiom\r\n\r\nWe introduce here a new idiom and syntax: the global blackboard.\r\nUsually each Subtree (including the main tree) has its own blackboard, isolated from the others, unless we do remapping.\r\n\r\nWe additionally provide a top-level blackboard that can be accessed from everywhere, without any manual remapping, using the prefix \"@\"\r\n\r\nSee example: https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/examples/t19_global_blackboard.cpp\r\n\r\n## Entries of the blackboard are now timestamped!\r\n\r\nWe added a timestamp and a sequence number to each entry in the blackboard (both updated when we set the value).\r\n\r\nThis allow use to determine if the value we are reading in the blackboard is \"new\" (since the last time we accessed it) or \"obsolate\".\r\n\r\nWe added the methods `Blackboard::getStamped` and `TreeNode::getInputStamped`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we added 3 new builtin nodes that use this functionality:\r\n- `SkipUnlessUpdated`:  decorator that skip the execution of the children unless an entry was updated, since the last time.\r\n- `WaitValueUpdate`:  decorator that remains in RUNNING state, unless an entry was updated. Executes the child if it did.\r\n- `WasEntryUpdated`: action that returns SUCCESS if an entry was updated, FAILURE otherwise.\r\n\r\n## String + number concatenation in the scripting language\r\n\r\nDetails: https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/pull/802\r\n\r\nWe use the operator \"..\" to concatenate strings and numbers (inspired by Lua).\r\nGive this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nprefix := 'value_';\r\nval := 42;\r\nstr:= prefix .. val\r\n```\r\nThe variable \"str\" should contain the string \"value_42\"\r\n\r\n##  Enhanced SQlite logger\r\n\r\nWe added a method to send comands directly to the database and to append  extra information to a state transition in the **Transitions** table.\r\n\r\nSee example https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/examples/t16_sqlite_log.cpp\r\n\r\n## Refactored API to register JSON convertions.\r\n\r\nWe simplified the way a custom type can be converted from/to JSON. See the example here:\r\nhttps://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/examples/t11_groot_howto.cpp#L13-L27\r\n\r\n## Blackup / restore a blackboard state.\r\n\r\nRelated somehow to the JSON convertion mentioned earlier.\r\nWe add some methods to save/load the state of a blackboard. usefull if you want to reset it correctly, withour destrying it and rebuilding it from scratch.\r\n\r\nSee this tutorial: https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/examples/t17_blackboard_backup.cpp\r\n\r\n## convertToString\r\n\r\nAdded more **convertToString** specializations\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/releases/153143699/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":15,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/releases/145242806","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/releases/145242806/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/releases/145242806/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/releases/tag/4.5.2","id":145242806,"author":{"login":"facontidavide","id":2822888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjI4ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2822888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide","html_url":"https://github.com/facontidavide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facontidavide/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOCSNuMs4IqDq2","tag_name":"4.5.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"4.5.2:

Note that it also required some radical changes in the **Blackboard**. \r\n\r\nThe user facing API did not change, but the internal one did; therefore, those users which use directly the Blackboard (something that is **discouraged**), might be affected.\r\n\r\n## Refactoring: Pimpl\r\n\r\nTo prevent more ABI compatibility issues in the future, we started using the **PImpl idiom** in multiple classes (`TreeNode` and `BehaviorTreeFactory` in particular).\r\n\r\n## New logger: FileLogger2\r\n\r\nThis is a replacement of the old `FileLogger` using Flatbuffers.

Breaking change\r\n\r\nSince version 4.0, the behavior of Sequence and Fallback was changes, compared to 3.x.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation would return RUNNING after executing a Synchronous child.\r\n\r\nThis new behavior was **reverted** in 4.2. \r\nNow the **default behavior is the same as 3.8**.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the new behavior, you should switch to `AsyncSequence` and `AsyncFallback`.\r\n\r\n# Thread-safe access to ports with reference semantic\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to store objects with reference semantic (for instance `std::shared_ptr<T>`) in the blackboard.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this makes it impossible for the setter and getter of the `Blackboard` to make the access to the object **T** thread-safe.\r\n\r\nWe propose a solution to this problem that uses:\r\n\r\n- `Blackboard::getAnyLocked`\r\n- `TreeNode::getLockedPortContent`\r\n\r\nThese new interfaces return an object called `AnyPtrLocked`.\r\n\r\n This contains the pointer to the object **Any**, but will also keep the a mutex locked as long as the object exist.\r\n \r\n To see a practical example, check `LoopNode` and the example 4 (**ex4_waypoints**).\r\n\r\n# Other

At deployment time, i.e. before the tree is instantiated, we can add \"rules\" to the BT factory to substitute certain Nodes with another implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful when generating unit tests, i.e. when we want to substitute Nodes with dummy ones.\r\n\r\nWe provide a specific \"dummy node\" called [TestNode](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/include/behaviortree_cpp/actions/test_node.h) that should cover the vast majority of the use cases.\r\n\r\nAlso, the [TreeObserver](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/include/behaviortree_cpp/loggers/bt_observer.h) is a great tool to create unit tests: it allows the user to check which Nodes have been ticked, and what they returned, in a non-intrusive way.\r\n\r\n# Dependencies and build\r\n\r\n- We removed the dependency from **Boost**, which was used only for its coroutine library. We use now [minicoro](https://github.com/edubart/minicoro). Boost is a \"commodity\" in Linux, but quite annoying for Windows users.\r\n\r\n- We now use [conan](https://conan.io/) to download dependencies in non-ROS builds. \r\n\r\n# Groot2 interface\r\n\r\nWe included the first, preliminary version of the [Groot2Publisher](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/include/behaviortree_cpp/loggers/groot2_publisher.h), which can be used to communicate in real-time with [Groot2](https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot) to do amazing things:\r\n\r\n- real-time visualization of the BT status\r\n- blackboard visualization\r\n- insert breakpoints in the tree and wait for \"Continue\" in Groot2\r\n- mocking of Nodes at run-time (force FAILURE or SUCCESS)\r\n- fault injection: make a node fail to trigger the execution of recovery branches.\r\n\r\n# Important bug fixes\r\n\r\n- #525  Pre-Condition : _skipIf NOT working with ReactiveSequence\r\n- #517  Halting the tree doesn't set the root node to idle\r\n- #515  \"ReactiveSequence is not supposed to reach this point\"\r\n- #514  Changed behavior of tickOnce\r\n- #507 _skipIf precondition does not work with SubTree  \r\n-  #506 Floating point values set by
