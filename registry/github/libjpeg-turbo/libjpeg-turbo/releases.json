The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\n#### Packaging Changes\n\n- The RPM packages now contain SHA-256 header and payload digests.  This fixes an issue whereby the RPM signatures could not be verified on Red Hat Enterprise Linux with FIPS mode enabled.  The RPM packages now require GLIBC 2.17 or later.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [Active](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Sponsors\n----------------\n\nThis release was made possible via funding from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com).\n\n[![The MathWorks, Inc.](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/mathworks.png \"The MathWorks, Inc.\")](https://www.mathworks.com)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 3.1 beta1:\n\n1. Fixed an issue in the TurboJPEG API whereby, when generating a lossless JPEG image with more than 8 bits per sample, specifying a point transform value greater than 7 resulted in an error (\"Parameter value out of range\") unless `TJPARAM_PRECISION`/`TJ.PARAM_PRECISION` was specified before `TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPT`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPT`.\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 1.4 beta1[3] that prevented `jpeg_set_defaults()` from resetting the Huffman tables to default (baseline) values if Huffman table optimization or progressive mode was previously enabled in the same libjpeg instance.\n\n3. Fixed an issue whereby lossless JPEG compression could not be disabled if it was previously enabled in a libjpeg or TurboJPEG instance. `jpeg_set_defaults()` now disables lossless JPEG compression in a libjpeg instance, and setting `TJPARAM_LOSSLESS`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESS` to `0` now disables lossless JPEG compression in a TurboJPEG

The libjpeg-turbo source tree has been reorganized to make it easier to find the README files, license information, and build instructions.  The documentation for the libjpeg API library and associated programs has been moved into the **doc/** subdirectory, all C source code and headers have been moved into a new **src/** subdirectory, and test scripts have been moved into a new **test/** subdirectory.\n\n2. cjpeg no longer allows GIF input files to be converted into 12-bit-per-sample JPEG files.  That was never a useful feature, since GIF images have at most 256 colors referenced from a palette of 8-bit-per-component RGB values.\n\n3. Added support for lossless JPEG images with 2 to 15 bits per sample to the libjpeg and TurboJPEG APIs.  When creating or decompressing a lossless JPEG image and when loading or saving a PBMPLUS image, functions/methods specific to 8-bit samples now handle 8-bit samples with 2 to 8 bits of data precision (specified using the `data_precision` field in `jpeg_compress_struct` or `jpeg_decompress_struct` or using `TJPARAM_PRECISION`/`TJ.PARAM_PRECISION`), functions/methods specific to 12-bit samples now handle 12-bit samples with 9 to 12 bits of data precision, and functions/methods specific to 16-bit samples now handle 16-bit samples with 13 to 16 bits of data precision.  Refer to [libjpeg.txt](doc/libjpeg.txt), [usage.txt](doc/usage.txt), and the TurboJPEG API documentation for more details.\n\n4. All deprecated constants and methods in the TurboJPEG Java API have been removed.\n\n5. TJBench command-line arguments are now more consistent with those of cjpeg, djpeg, and jpegtran.  More specifically:\n\n     - `-copynone` has been replaced with `-copy none`.\n     - `-fastdct` has been replaced with `-dct fast`.\n     - `-fastupsample` has been replaced with `-nosmooth`.\n     - `-hflip` and `-vflip` have been replaced with `-flip {horizontal|vertical}`.\n     - `-limitscans` has been replaced with `-maxscans`, which allows the scan limit to be specified.\n     - `-rgb`, `-bgr`, `-rgbx`, `-bgrx`, `-xbgr`, `-xrgb`, and `-cmyk` have been replaced with `-pixelformat {rgb|bgr|rgbx|bgrx|xbgr|xrgb|cmyk}`.\n     - `-rot90`, `-rot180`, and `-rot270` have been replaced with `-rotate {90|180|270}`.\n     - `-stoponwarning` has been replaced with `-strict`.\n     - British spellings for `gray` (`grey`) and `optimize` (`optimise`) are now allowed.\n\n    The old command-line arguments are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  TJBench command-line arguments can now be abbreviated as well. (Where possible, the abbreviations are the same as those supported by cjpeg, djpeg, and jpegtran.)\n\n6. Added a new TJBench option (`-pixelformat gray`) that can be used to test the performance of compressing/decompressing a grayscale JPEG image from/to a packed-pixel grayscale image.\n\n7. Fixed an issue whereby, if `TJPARAM_NOREALLOC` was set, TurboJPEG compression and lossless transformation functions ignored the JPEG buffer size(s) passed to them and assumed that the JPEG buffer(s) had been allocated to a worst-case size returned by `tj3JPEGBufSize()`.  This behavior was never documented, although the documentation was unclear regarding whether the JPEG buffer size should be specified if a JPEG buffer is pre-allocated to a worst-case size.\n\n8. The TurboJPEG C and Java APIs have been improved in the following ways:\n\n     - New image I/O methods (`TJCompressor.loadSourceImage()` and `TJDecompressor.saveImage()`) have been added to the Java API.  These methods work similarly to the `tj3LoadImage*()` and `tj3SaveImage*()` functions in the C API.\n     - The TurboJPEG lossless transformation function and methods now add restart markers to all destination images if `TJPARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS` or `TJPARAM_RESTARTROWS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTROWS` is set.\n     - New functions/methods (`tj3SetICCProfile()` / `TJCompressor.setICCProfile()` / `TJTransformer.setICCProfile()` and `tj3GetICCProfile()` / `TJDecompressor.getICCProfile()`) can be used to embed and retrieve ICC profiles.\n     - A new parameter (`TJPARAM_SAVEMARKERS`/`TJ.PARAM_SAVEMARKERS`) can be used to specify the types of markers that will be copied from the source image to the destination image during lossless transformation if `TJXOPT_COPYNONE`/`TJTransform.OPT_COPYNONE` is not specified.\n     - A new convenience function/method (`tj3TransformBufSize()` / `TJTransformer.bufSize()`) can be used to compute the worst-case destination buffer size for a given lossless transform, taking into account cropping, transposition of the width and height, grayscale conversion, and the embedded or extracted ICC profile.\n\n9. TJExample has been replaced with three programs (TJComp, TJDecomp, and TJTran) that demonstrate how to approximate the functionality of cjpeg, djpeg, and jpegtran using the TurboJPEG C and Java APIs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/175093649/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/175091814","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/175091814/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/175091814/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/3.0.4","id":175091814,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAl6yRs4Kb7Bm","tag_name":"3.0.4","target_commitish":"main","name":"3.0.4","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-09-14T15:10:59Z","published_at":"2024-09-14T19:46:36Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/192645547","id":192645547,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4Le4mr","name":"libjpeg-turbo-3.0.4-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-msdownload","state":"uploaded","size":1655832,"download_count":424,"created_at":"2024-09-14T19:46:56Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T19:46:57Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/3.0.4/libjpeg-turbo-3.0.4-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/192645537","id":192645537,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4Le4mh","name":"libjpeg-turbo-3.0.4-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-msdownload","state":"uploaded","size":2000176,"download_count":640,"created_at":"2024-09-14T19:46:47Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T19:46:48Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/3.0.4/libjpeg-turbo-3.0.4-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/192645545","id":192645545,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4Le4mp","name":"libjpeg-turbo-3.0.4-vc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4

Fixed an issue whereby the CPU usage of the default marker processor in the decompressor grew exponentially with the number of markers.  This caused an unreasonable slow-down in `jpeg_read_header()` if an application called `jpeg_save_markers()` to save markers of a particular type and then attempted to decompress a JPEG image containing an excessive number of markers of that type.\n\n2. Hardened the default marker processor in the decompressor to guard against an issue (exposed by 3.0 beta2[6]) whereby attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image (specifically an image with a complete 12-bit-per-sample Start Of Frame segment followed by an incomplete 8-bit-per-sample Start Of Frame segment) using buffered-image mode and input prefetching caused a segfault if the `fill_input_buffer()` method in the calling application's custom source manager incorrectly returned `FALSE` in response to a prematurely-terminated JPEG data stream.\n\n3. Fixed an issue in cjpeg whereby, when generating a 12-bit-per-sample or 16-bit-per-sample lossless JPEG image, specifying a point transform value greater than 7 resulted in an error (\"Invalid progressive/lossless parameters\") unless the `-precision` option was specified before the `-lossless` option.\n\n4. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.0.3[3] that made it impossible for calling applications to generate 12-bit-per-sample arithmetic-coded lossy JPEG images using the TurboJPEG API.\n\n5. Fixed an error (\"Destination buffer is not large enough\") that occurred when attempting to generate a full-color lossless JPEG image using the TurboJPEG Java API's `byte[] TJCompressor.compress()` method if the value of `TJ.PARAM_SUBSAMP` was not `TJ.SAMP_444`.\n\n6. Fixed a segfault in djpeg that occurred if a negative width was specified with the `-crop` option.  Since the cropping region width was read into an unsigned 32-bit integer, a negative width was interpreted as a very large value.  With certain negative width and positive left boundary values, the bounds checks in djpeg and `jpeg_crop_scanline()` overflowed and did not detect the out-of-bounds width, which caused a buffer overrun in the upsampling or color conversion routine.  Both bounds checks now use 64-bit integers to guard against overflow, and djpeg now checks for negative numbers when it parses the crop specification from the command line.\n\n7. Fixed an issue whereby the TurboJPEG lossless transformation function and methods checked the specified cropping region against the source image dimensions and level of chrominance subsampling rather than the destination image dimensions and level of chrominance subsampling, which caused some cropping regions to be unduly rejected when performing 90-degree rotation, 270-degree rotation, transposition, transverse transposition, or grayscale conversion.\n\n8. Fixed a regression, introduced by 3.0 beta2[4], that prevented the `tjTransform()` backward compatibility function from copying extra markers from the source image to the destination image.\n\n9. Fixed an issue whereby the TurboJPEG lossless transformation function and methods did not honor `TJXOPT_COPYNONE`/`TJTransform.OPT_COPYNONE` unless it was specified for all lossless

Fixed an issue in the build system, introduced in 3.0.2, that caused all libjpeg-turbo components to depend on the Visual C++ run-time DLL when built with Visual C++ and CMake 3.15 or later, regardless of value of the `WITH_CRT_DLL` CMake variable.\n\n2. The x86-64 SIMD extensions now include support for Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET), which is enabled automatically if CET is enabled in the C compiler.\n\n3. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.0 beta2[6] that made it impossible for calling applications to supply custom Huffman tables when generating 12-bit-per-component lossy JPEG images using the libjpeg API.\n\n4. Fixed a segfault that occurred when attempting to use the jpegtran `-drop` option with a specially-crafted malformed input image or drop image (specifically an image in which all of the scans contain

**libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2.tar.gz** is the official source tarball for this release.  The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\n#### Packaging Changes\n\n- New copies of **libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2-vc.exe** and **libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2-vc64.exe** were uploaded on 2024-01-25 to work around a build system issue that caused all Windows libjpeg-turbo components to depend on the Visual C++ run-time DLL.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [Maintenance](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 3.0.1:\n\n1. Fixed a signed integer overflow in the `tj3CompressFromYUV8()`, `tj3DecodeYUV8()`, `tj3DecompressToYUV8()`, and `tj3EncodeYUV8()` functions, detected by the Clang and GCC undefined behavior sanitizers, that could be triggered by setting the `align` parameter to an unreasonably large value.  This issue did not pose a security threat, but removing the warning made it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n\n2. Introduced a new parameter (`TJPARAM_MAXMEMORY` in the TurboJPEG C API and `TJ.PARAM_MAXMEMORY` in the TurboJPEG Java API) and a corresponding TJBench option (`-maxmemory`) for specifying the maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) that will be allocated for intermediate buffers, which are used with progressive JPEG compression and decompression, Huffman table optimization, lossless JPEG compression, and lossless transformation.  The new parameter and option serve the same purpose as the `max_memory_to_use` field in the `jpeg_memory_mgr` struct in the libjpeg API, the `JPEGMEM` environment variable, and the cjpeg/djpeg/jpegtran `-maxmemory` option.\n\n3. Introduced a new parameter (`TJPARAM_MAXPIXELS` in the TurboJPEG C API and `TJ.PARAM_MAXPIXELS` in the TurboJPEG Java API) and a corresponding TJBench option (`-maxpixels`) for specifying the maximum number of pixels that the decompression, lossless transformation, and packed-pixel image loading functions/methods will process.\n\n4. Fixed an error (\"Unsupported color conversion request\") that occurred when attempting to decompress a 3-component lossless JPEG image without an Adobe APP14 marker.

The x86-64 SIMD functions now use a standard stack frame, prologue, and epilogue so that debuggers and profilers can reliably capture backtraces from within the functions.\n\n2. Fixed two minor issues in the interblock smoothing algorithm that caused mathematical (but not necessarily perceptible) edge block errors when decompressing progressive JPEG images exactly two DCT blocks in width or that use vertical chrominance subsampling.\n\n3. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.0 beta2[6] that, in rare cases, caused the C Huffman encoder (which is not used by default on x86 and Arm CPUs) to generate incorrect results if the Neon SIMD

The TurboJPEG API now supports 4:4:1 (transposed 4:1:1) chrominance subsampling, which allows losslessly transposed or rotated 4:1:1 JPEG images to be losslessly cropped, partially decompressed, or decompressed to planar YUV images.\n\n2. Fixed various segfaults and buffer overruns (CVE-2023-2804) that occurred when attempting to decompress various specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component lossless JPEG images using color quantization or merged chroma upsampling/color conversion.  The underlying cause of these issues was that the color quantization and merged chroma upsampling/color conversion algorithms were not designed with lossless decompression in mind.  Since libjpeg-turbo explicitly does not support color conversion when compressing or decompressing lossless JPEG images, merged chroma upsampling/color conversion never should have been enabled for such images.  Color quantization is a legacy feature that serves little or no purpose with lossless JPEG images, so it is also now disabled when decompressing such images.  (As a result, djpeg can no longer decompress a lossless JPEG image into a GIF image.)\n\n3. Fixed an oversight in 1.4 beta1[8] that caused various segfaults and buffer overruns when attempting to decompress various specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component JPEG images using djpeg with both color quantization and RGB565 color conversion enabled.\n\n4. Fixed an issue whereby `jpeg_crop_scanline()` sometimes miscalculated the downsampled width for components with 4x2 or 2x4 subsampling factors if decompression scaling was enabled.  This caused the components to be upsampled incompletely, which caused the color converter to read from uninitialized memory.  With 12-bit data precision, this caused a buffer overrun or underrun and subsequent segfault if the sample value read from uninitialized memory was outside of the valid sample range.\n\n5. Fixed a long-standing issue whereby the `tj3Transform()` function, when used with the `TJXOP_TRANSPOSE`, `TJXOP_TRANSVERSE`, `TJXOP_ROT90`, or `TJXOP_ROT270` transform operation and without automatic JPEG destination buffer (re)allocation or lossless cropping, computed the worst-case transformed JPEG image size based on the source image dimensions rather than the transformed image dimensions.  If a calling program allocated the JPEG destination buffer based on the transformed image dimensions, as the API documentation instructs, and attempted to transform a specially-crafted 4:2:2, 4:4:0, 4:1:1, or 4:4:1 JPEG source image containing a large amount of metadata, the issue caused `tj3Transform()` to overflow the JPEG destination buffer rather than fail gracefully.  The issue could be worked around by setting `TJXOPT_COPYNONE`.  Note that, irrespective of this issue, `tj3Transform()` cannot reliably transform JPEG source images that contain a large amount of metadata unless automatic JPEG destination buffer (re)allocation is used or `TJXOPT_COPYNONE` is set.\n\n6. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.0 beta2[6] that prevented the djpeg `-map` option from working when decompressing 12-bit-per-component lossy JPEG images.\n\n7. Fixed an issue that caused the C Huffman encoder (which is not used by default on x86 and Arm CPUs) to read from uninitialized memory when attempting to transform a specially-crafted malformed arithmetic-coded JPEG source image into a baseline Huffman-coded JPEG destination

The SIMD dispatchers in libjpeg-turbo 2.1.4 and prior stored the list of supported SIMD instruction sets in a global variable, which caused an innocuous race condition whereby the variable could have been initialized multiple times if `jpeg_start_*compress()` was called simultaneously in multiple threads. libjpeg-turbo 3.0 beta1 included an undocumented attempt to fix this race condition by making the SIMD support variable thread-local.  However, that caused another issue whereby, if `jpeg_start_*compress()` was called in one thread and `jpeg_read_*()` or `jpeg_write_*()` was called in a second thread, the SIMD support variable was never initialized in the second thread.  On x86 systems, this led the second thread to incorrectly assume that AVX2 instructions were always available, and when it attempted to use those instructions on older x86 CPUs that do not support them, an illegal instruction error occurred.  The SIMD dispatchers now ensure that the SIMD support variable is initialized before dispatching based on its value.\n\n### Significant changes relative to 2.1.5:\n\n1. Significantly sped up the computation of optimal Huffman tables.  This speeds up the compression of tiny images by as much as 2x and provides a noticeable speedup for images as large as 256x256 when using optimal Huffman tables.\n\n2. All deprecated fields, constructors, and methods in the TurboJPEG Java API have been removed.\n\n3. Arithmetic entropy coding is now supported with 12-bit-per-component JPEG images.\n\n4. Overhauled the TurboJPEG API to address long-standing limitations and to make the API more extensible and intuitive:\n\n     - All C function names are now prefixed with `tj3`, and all version suffixes have been removed from the function names.  Future API overhauls will increment the prefix to `tj4`, etc., thus retaining backward API/ABI compatibility without versioning each individual function.\n     - Stateless boolean flags have been replaced with stateful integer API parameters, the values of which persist between function calls.  New functions/methods (`tj3Set()`/`TJCompressor.set()`/`TJDecompressor.set()` and `tj3Get()`/`TJCompressor.get()`/`TJDecompressor.get()`) can be used to set and query the value of a particular API parameter.\n     - The JPEG quality and subsampling are now implemented using API parameters rather than stateless function arguments (C) or dedicated set/get methods (Java.)\n     - `tj3DecompressHeader()` now stores all relevant information about the JPEG image, including the width, height, subsampling type, entropy coding algorithm, etc., in API parameters rather than returning that information through pointer arguments.\n     - `TJFLAG_LIMITSCANS`/`TJ.FLAG_LIMITSCANS` has been reimplemented as an API parameter (`TJPARAM_SCANLIMIT`/`TJ.PARAM_SCANLIMIT`) that allows the number of scans to be specified.\n     - Huffman table optimization can now be specified, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_OPTIMIZE`/`TJ.PARAM_OPTIMIZE`), a new transform option (`TJXOPT_OPTIMIZE`/`TJTransform.OPT_OPTIMIZE`), and a new TJBench option (`-optimize`.)\n     - Arithmetic entropy coding can now be specified or queried, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_ARITHMETIC`/`TJ.PARAM_ARITHMETIC`), a new transform option (`TJXOPT_ARITHMETIC`/`TJTransform.OPT_ARITHMETIC`), and a new TJBench option (`-arithmetic`.)\n     - The restart marker interval can now be specified, using new API parameters (`TJPARAM_RESTARTROWS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTROWS` and `TJPARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS`) and a new TJBench option (`-restart`.)\n     - Pixel density can now be specified or queried, using new API parameters (`TJPARAM_XDENSITY`/`TJ.PARAM_XDENSITY`, `TJPARAM_YDENSITY`/`TJ.PARAM_YDENSITY`, and `TJPARAM_DENSITYUNITS`/`TJ.PARAM_DENSITYUNITS`.)\n     - The accurate DCT/IDCT algorithms are now the default for both compression and decompression, since the \"fast\" algorithms are considered to be a legacy feature.  (The \"fast\" algorithms do not pass the ISO compliance tests, and those algorithms are not any faster than the accurate algorithms on modern x86 CPUs.)\n     - All C initialization functions have been combined into a single function (`tj3Init()`) that accepts an integer argument specifying the subsystems to initialize.\n     - All C functions now use the `const` keyword for pointer arguments that point to unmodified buffers (and for both dimensions of pointer arguments that point to sets of unmodified buffers.)\n     - All C functions now use `size_t` rather than `unsigned long` to represent buffer sizes, for compatibility with `malloc()` and to avoid disparities in the size of `unsigned long` between LP64 (Un*x) and LLP64 (Windows) operating systems.\n     - All C buffer size functions now return 0 if an error occurs, rather than trying to awkwardly return -1 in an unsigned data type (which could easily be misinterpreted as a very large value.)\n     - Decompression scaling is now enabled explicitly, using a new function/method (`tj3SetScalingFactor()`/`TJDecompressor.setScalingFactor()`), rather than implicitly using awkward \"desired width\"/\"desired height\" arguments.\n     - Partial image decompression has been implemented, using a new function/method (`tj3SetCroppingRegion()`/`TJDecompressor.setCroppingRegion()`) and a new TJBench option (`-crop`.)\n     - The JPEG colorspace can now be specified explicitly when compressing, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_COLORSPACE`/`TJ.PARAM_COLORSPACE`.)  This allows JPEG images with the RGB and CMYK colorspaces to be created.\n     - TJBench no longer generates error/difference images, since identical functionality is already available in ImageMagick.\n     - JPEG images with unknown subsampling configurations can now be fully decompressed into packed-pixel images or losslessly transformed (with the exception of lossless cropping.)  They cannot currently be partially decompressed or decompressed into planar YUV images.\n     - `tj3Destroy()` now silently accepts a NULL handle.\n     - `tj3Alloc()` and `tj3Free()` now return/accept void pointers, as `malloc()` and `free()` do.\n     - The C image I/O functions now accept a TurboJPEG instance handle, which is used to transmit/receive API parameter values and to receive error information.\n\n5. Added support for 8-bit-per-component, 12-bit-per-component, and 16-bit-per-component lossless JPEG images.  A new libjpeg API function (`jpeg_enable_lossless()`), TurboJPEG API parameters (`TJPARAM_LOSSLESS`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESS`, `TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPSV`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPSV`, and `TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPT`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPT`), and a cjpeg/TJBench option (`-lossless`) can be used to create a lossless JPEG image.  (Decompression of lossless JPEG images is handled automatically.)  Refer to [libjpeg.txt](libjpeg.txt), [usage.txt](usage.txt), and the TurboJPEG API documentation for more details.\n\n6. Added support for 12-bit-per-component (lossy and lossless) and 16-bit-per-component (lossless) JPEG images to the libjpeg and TurboJPEG APIs:\n\n     - The existing `data_precision` field in `jpeg_compress_struct` and `jpeg_decompress_struct` has been repurposed to enable the creation of 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component JPEG images or to detect whether a 12-bit-per-component or 16-bit-per-component JPEG image is being decompressed.\n     - New 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component versions of `jpeg_write_scanlines()` and `jpeg_read_scanlines()`, as well as new 12-bit-per-component versions of `jpeg_write_raw_data()`, `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`, `jpeg_crop_scanline()`, and `jpeg_read_raw_data()`, provide interfaces for compressing from/decompressing to 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component packed-pixel and planar YUV image buffers.\n     - New 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component compression, decompression, and image I/O functions/methods have been added to the TurboJPEG API, and a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_PRECISION`/`TJ.PARAM_PRECISION`) can be used to query the data precision of a JPEG image.  (YUV functions are currently limited to 8-bit data precision but can be expanded to accommodate 12-bit data precision in the future, if such is deemed beneficial.)\n     - A new cjpeg and TJBench command-line argument (`-precision`) can be used to create a 12-bit-per-component or 16-bit-per-component JPEG image.

The SIMD dispatchers in libjpeg-turbo 2.1.4 and prior stored the list of supported SIMD instruction sets in a global variable, which caused an innocuous race condition whereby the variable could have been initialized multiple times if `jpeg_start_*compress()` was called simultaneously in multiple threads. libjpeg-turbo 2.1.5 included an undocumented attempt to fix this race condition by making the SIMD support variable thread-local.  However, that caused another issue whereby, if `jpeg_start_*compress()` was called in one thread and `jpeg_read_*()` or `jpeg_write_*()` was called in a second thread, the SIMD support variable was never initialized in the second thread.  On x86 systems, this led the second thread to incorrectly assume that AVX2 instructions were always available, and when it attempted to use those instructions on older x86 CPUs that do not support them, an illegal instruction error occurred.  The SIMD dispatchers now ensure that the SIMD support variable is initialized before dispatching based on its value.\n\n### Significant changes relative to 2.1.4:\n\n1. Fixed issues in the build system whereby, when using the Ninja Multi-Config CMake generator, a static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which `ENABLE_SHARED` is `0`) could not be installed, a Windows installer could not be built, and the Java regression tests failed.\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] that caused a buffer overrun in the progressive Huffman encoder when attempting to transform a specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component JPEG image into a progressive 12-bit-per-component JPEG image using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`.)  Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the progressive Huffman encoder structure and did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior, given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, and given that 12-bit-per-component builds of libjpeg-turbo are uncommon, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.\n\n3. Fixed an issue whereby, when using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`), passing samples with values greater than 4095 or less than 0 to `jpeg_write_scanlines()` caused a buffer overrun or underrun in the RGB-to-YCbCr color converter.\n\n4. Fixed a floating point exception that occurred when attempting to use the jpegtran `-drop` and `-trim` options to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.\n\n5. Fixed an issue in `tjBufSizeYUV2()` whereby it returned a bogus result, rather than throwing an error, if the `align` parameter was not a power of 2. Fixed a similar issue in `tjCompressFromYUV()` whereby it generated a corrupt JPEG image in certain cases, rather than throwing an error, if the `align` parameter was not a power of 2.\n\n6. Fixed an issue whereby `tjDecompressToYUV2()`, which is a wrapper for `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`, used the desired YUV image dimensions rather than the actual scaled image dimensions when computing the plane pointers and strides to pass to `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`.  This caused a buffer overrun and subsequent segfault if the desired image dimensions exceeded the scaled image dimensions.\n\n7. Fixed an issue whereby, when decompressing a 12-bit-per-component JPEG image (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`) using an alpha-enabled output color space such as `JCS_EXT_RGBA`, the alpha channel was set to 255 rather than 4095.\n\n8. Fixed an issue whereby the Java version of TJBench did not accept a range of quality values.\n\n9. Fixed an issue whereby, when `-progressive` was passed to TJBench, the JPEG input image was not transformed into a progressive JPEG image prior to

Significantly sped up the computation of optimal Huffman tables.  This speeds up the compression of tiny images by as much as 2x and provides a noticeable speedup for images as large as 256x256 when using optimal Huffman tables.\n\n2. All deprecated fields, constructors, and methods in the TurboJPEG Java API have been removed.\n\n3. Arithmetic entropy coding is now supported with 12-bit-per-component JPEG images.\n\n4. Overhauled the TurboJPEG API to address long-standing limitations and to make the API more extensible and intuitive:\n\n     - All C function names are now prefixed with `tj3`, and all version suffixes have been removed from the function names.  Future API overhauls will increment the prefix to `tj4`, etc., thus retaining backward API/ABI compatibility without versioning each individual function.\n     - Stateless boolean flags have been replaced with stateful integer API parameters, the values of which persist between function calls.  New functions/methods (`tj3Set()`/`TJCompressor.set()`/`TJDecompressor.set()` and `tj3Get()`/`TJCompressor.get()`/`TJDecompressor.get()`) can be used to set and query the value of a particular API parameter.\n     - The JPEG quality and subsampling are now implemented using API parameters rather than stateless function arguments (C) or dedicated set/get methods (Java.)\n     - `tj3DecompressHeader()` now stores all relevant information about the JPEG image, including the width, height, subsampling type, entropy coding algorithm, etc., in API parameters rather than returning that information through pointer arguments.\n     - `TJFLAG_LIMITSCANS`/`TJ.FLAG_LIMITSCANS` has been reimplemented as an API parameter (`TJPARAM_SCANLIMIT`/`TJ.PARAM_SCANLIMIT`) that allows the number of scans to be specified.\n     - Huffman table optimization can now be specified, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_OPTIMIZE`/`TJ.PARAM_OPTIMIZE`), a new transform option (`TJXOPT_OPTIMIZE`/`TJTransform.OPT_OPTIMIZE`), and a new TJBench option (`-optimize`.)\n     - Arithmetic entropy coding can now be specified or queried, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_ARITHMETIC`/`TJ.PARAM_ARITHMETIC`), a new transform option (`TJXOPT_ARITHMETIC`/`TJTransform.OPT_ARITHMETIC`), and a new TJBench option (`-arithmetic`.)\n     - The restart marker interval can now be specified, using new API parameters (`TJPARAM_RESTARTROWS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTROWS` and `TJPARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS`/`TJ.PARAM_RESTARTBLOCKS`) and a new TJBench option (`-restart`.)\n     - Pixel density can now be specified or queried, using new API parameters (`TJPARAM_XDENSITY`/`TJ.PARAM_XDENSITY`, `TJPARAM_YDENSITY`/`TJ.PARAM_YDENSITY`, and `TJPARAM_DENSITYUNITS`/`TJ.PARAM_DENSITYUNITS`.)\n     - The accurate DCT/IDCT algorithms are now the default for both compression and decompression, since the \"fast\" algorithms are considered to be a legacy feature.  (The \"fast\" algorithms do not pass the ISO compliance tests, and those algorithms are not any faster than the accurate algorithms on modern x86 CPUs.)\n     - All C initialization functions have been combined into a single function (`tj3Init()`) that accepts an integer argument specifying the subsystems to initialize.\n     - All C functions now use the `const` keyword for pointer arguments that point to unmodified buffers (and for both dimensions of pointer arguments that point to sets of unmodified buffers.)\n     - All C functions now use `size_t` rather than `unsigned long` to represent buffer sizes, for compatibility with `malloc()` and to avoid disparities in the size of `unsigned long` between LP64 (Un*x) and LLP64 (Windows) operating systems.\n     - All C buffer size functions now return 0 if an error occurs, rather than trying to awkwardly return -1 in an unsigned data type (which could easily be misinterpreted as a very large value.)\n     - Decompression scaling is now enabled explicitly, using a new function/method (`tj3SetScalingFactor()`/`TJDecompressor.setScalingFactor()`), rather than implicitly using awkward \"desired width\"/\"desired height\" arguments.\n     - Partial image decompression has been implemented, using a new function/method (`tj3SetCroppingRegion()`/`TJDecompressor.setCroppingRegion()`) and a new TJBench option (`-crop`.)\n     - The JPEG colorspace can now be specified explicitly when compressing, using a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_COLORSPACE`/`TJ.PARAM_COLORSPACE`.)  This allows JPEG images with the RGB and CMYK colorspaces to be created.\n     - TJBench no longer generates error/difference images, since identical functionality is already available in ImageMagick.\n     - JPEG images with unknown subsampling configurations can now be fully decompressed into packed-pixel images or losslessly transformed (with the exception of lossless cropping.)  They cannot currently be partially decompressed or decompressed into planar YUV images.\n     - `tj3Destroy()` now silently accepts a NULL handle.\n     - `tj3Alloc()` and `tj3Free()` now return/accept void pointers, as `malloc()` and `free()` do.\n     - The C image I/O functions now accept a TurboJPEG instance handle, which is used to transmit/receive API parameter values and to receive error information.\n\n5. Added support for 8-bit-per-component, 12-bit-per-component, and 16-bit-per-component lossless JPEG images.  A new libjpeg API function (`jpeg_enable_lossless()`), TurboJPEG API parameters (`TJPARAM_LOSSLESS`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESS`, `TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPSV`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPSV`, and `TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPT`/`TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPT`), and a cjpeg/TJBench option (`-lossless`) can be used to create a lossless JPEG image.  (Decompression of lossless JPEG images is handled automatically.)  Refer to [libjpeg.txt](libjpeg.txt), [usage.txt](usage.txt), and the TurboJPEG API documentation for more details.\n\n6. Added support for 12-bit-per-component (lossy and lossless) and 16-bit-per-component (lossless) JPEG images to the libjpeg and TurboJPEG APIs:\n\n     - The existing `data_precision` field in `jpeg_compress_struct` and `jpeg_decompress_struct` has been repurposed to enable the creation of 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component JPEG images or to detect whether a 12-bit-per-component or 16-bit-per-component JPEG image is being decompressed.\n     - New 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component versions of `jpeg_write_scanlines()` and `jpeg_read_scanlines()`, as well as new 12-bit-per-component versions of `jpeg_write_raw_data()`, `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`, `jpeg_crop_scanline()`, and `jpeg_read_raw_data()`, provide interfaces for compressing from/decompressing to 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component packed-pixel and planar YUV image buffers.\n     - New 12-bit-per-component and 16-bit-per-component compression, decompression, and image I/O functions/methods have been added to the TurboJPEG API, and a new API parameter (`TJPARAM_PRECISION`/`TJ.PARAM_PRECISION`) can be used to query the data precision of a JPEG image.  (YUV functions are currently limited to 8-bit data precision but can be expanded to accommodate 12-bit data precision in the future, if such is deemed beneficial.)\n     - A new cjpeg and TJBench command-line argument (`-precision`) can be used to create a 12-bit-per-component or 16-bit-per-component JPEG image.

Fixed issues in the build system whereby, when using the Ninja Multi-Config CMake generator, a static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which `ENABLE_SHARED` is `0`) could not be installed, a Windows installer could not be built, and the Java regression tests failed.\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] that caused a buffer overrun in the progressive Huffman encoder when attempting to transform a specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component JPEG image into a progressive 12-bit-per-component JPEG image using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`.)  Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the progressive Huffman encoder structure and did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior, given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, and given that 12-bit-per-component builds of libjpeg-turbo are uncommon, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.\n\n3. Fixed an issue whereby, when using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`), passing samples with values greater than 4095 or less than 0 to `jpeg_write_scanlines()` caused a buffer overrun or underrun in the RGB-to-YCbCr color converter.\n\n4. Fixed a floating point exception that occurred when attempting to use the jpegtran `-drop` and `-trim` options to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.\n\n5. Fixed an issue in `tjBufSizeYUV2()` whereby it returned a bogus result, rather than throwing an error, if the `align` parameter was not a power of 2. Fixed a similar issue in `tjCompressFromYUV()` whereby it generated a corrupt JPEG image in certain cases, rather than throwing an error, if the `align` parameter was not a power of 2.\n\n6. Fixed an issue whereby `tjDecompressToYUV2()`, which is a wrapper for `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`, used the desired YUV image dimensions rather than the actual scaled image dimensions when computing the plane pointers and strides to pass to `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`.  This caused a buffer overrun and subsequent segfault if the desired image dimensions exceeded the scaled image dimensions.\n\n7. Fixed an issue whereby, when decompressing a 12-bit-per-component JPEG image (`-DWITH_12BIT=1`) using an alpha-enabled output color space such as `JCS_EXT_RGBA`, the alpha channel was set to 255 rather than 4095.\n\n8.

Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.3 that caused build failures with Visual Studio 2010.\n\n2. The `tjDecompressHeader3()` function in the TurboJPEG C API and the `TJDecompressor.setSourceImage()` method in the TurboJPEG Java API now accept \"abbreviated table specification\" (AKA \"tables-only\") datastreams, which can be used to prime the decompressor with quantization and Huffman tables that can be used when decompressing subsequent \"abbreviated image\" datastreams.\n\n3. libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on OS X/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile time. This allows both AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G4 and G5) and non-AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G3) CPUs to be supported using the same build of libjpeg-turbo.\n\n4. Fixed an error (\"Bogus virtual array access\") that occurred when attempting to decompress a progressive JPEG image with a height less than or equal to one iMCU (8 * the vertical sampling factor) using buffered-image mode with interblock smoothing enabled.  This was a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[6(b)].\n\n5. Fixed two issues that prevented partial image decompression from working properly with buffered-image mode:\n\n     - Attempting to call `jpeg_crop_scanline()` after `jpeg_start_decompress()` but before `jpeg_start_output()` resulted in an error (\"Improper call to JPEG library in state 207\".)\n     - Attempting to use `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` resulted in an error (\"Bogus virtual array access\") under certain circumstances.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/74317266/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/74312592","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/74312592/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/74312592/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/2.0.8-esr","id":74312592,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAl6yRs4EbeuQ","tag_name":"2.0.8-esr","target_commitish":"main","name":"2.0.8

Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[7] whereby cjpeg compressed PGM input files into full-color JPEG images unless the `-grayscale` option was used.\n\n2. cjpeg now automatically compresses GIF and 8-bit BMP input files into grayscale JPEG images if the input files contain only shades of gray.\n\n3. The build system now enables the intrinsics implementation of the AArch64 (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD extensions by default when using GCC 12 or later.\n\n4. Fixed a segfault that occurred while decompressing a 4:2:0 JPEG image using the merged (non-fancy) upsampling algorithms (that is, with `cinfo.do_fancy_upsampling` set to `FALSE`) along with `jpeg_crop_scanline()`. Specifically, the segfault occurred if the number of bytes remaining in the output buffer was less than the number of bytes required to represent one uncropped scanline of the output image.

**libjpeg-turbo-2.1.2.tar.gz** is the official source tarball for this release.  The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\n#### Packaging Changes\n\n- Linux/AArch64 RPM and DEB packages are now provided.\n- Fixed a regression whereby the TurboJPEG API DLL for MinGW depended on **libwinpthread-1.dll**.  This regression was apparently introduced when the global error handler in the TurboJPEG API library was made thread-safe (via the use of thread-local storage) in libjpeg-turbo 2.0.5.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [Extended](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 2.1.1:\n\n1. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the remaining GAS implementations of AArch64 (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD functions (which are used by default with GCC for performance reasons) to be placed in the `.rodata` section rather than in the `.text` section.  This caused the GNU linker to automatically place the `.rodata` section in an executable segment, which prevented libjpeg-turbo from working properly with other linkers and also represented a potential security risk.\n\n2. Fixed an issue whereby the `tjTransform()` function incorrectly computed the iMCU size for 4:4:4 JPEG images with non-unary sampling factors and thus unduly rejected some cropping regions, even though those regions aligned with 8x8 iMCU boundaries.\n\n3. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the build system to enable the Arm Neon SIMD extensions when targetting Armv6 and other legacy architectures that do not support Neon instructions.\n\n4. libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on FreeBSD/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile time.  This allows both AltiVec-equipped and non-AltiVec-equipped CPUs to be supported using the same build of libjpeg-turbo.\n\n5. cjpeg now accepts a `-strict` argument similar to that of djpeg and

Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.0 that caused build failures with non-GCC-compatible compilers for Un*x/Arm platforms.\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that prevented the Arm 32-bit (AArch32) Neon SIMD extensions from building unless the C compiler flags included `-mfloat-abi=softfp` or `-mfloat-abi=hard`.\n\n3. Fixed an issue in the AArch32 Neon SIMD Huffman encoder whereby reliance on undefined C compiler behavior led to crashes (\"SIGBUS: illegal alignment\") on Android systems when running AArch32/Thumb builds of libjpeg-turbo built with recent versions of Clang.\n\n4. Added a command-line argument (`-copy icc`) to jpegtran that causes it to copy only the ICC profile markers from the source file and discard any other metadata.\n\n5. libjpeg-turbo should now build and run on CHERI-enabled architectures, which use capability pointers that are larger than the size of `size_t`.\n\n6. Fixed a regression (CVE-2021-37972) introduced by 2.1 beta1[5] that caused a segfault in the 64-bit SSE2 Huffman encoder when attempting to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/41920923","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/41920923/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/41920923/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/2.1.0","id":41920923,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQxOTIwOTIz","tag_name":"2.1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"2.1.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-04-23T18:29:40Z","published_at":"2021-04-23T18:57:04Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137917222","id":137917222,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOHMm","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.1.0-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1294280,"download_count":6,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:36:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:36:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.1.0/libjpeg-turbo-2.1.0-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137917231","id":137917231,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOHMv","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.1.0-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1474512,"download_count":5,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:36:37Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:36:38Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.1.0/libjpeg-turbo-2.1.0-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137917194","id":137917194,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOHMK","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.1.0-vc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following

Fixed a regression (CVE-2021-29390) introduced by 2.1 beta1[6(b)] whereby attempting to decompress certain progressive JPEG images with one or more component planes of width 8 or less caused a buffer overrun.\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[6(b)] whereby attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed progressive JPEG image caused the block smoothing algorithm to read from uninitialized memory.\n\n3. Fixed an issue in the Arm Neon SIMD Huffman encoders that caused the encoders to generate incorrect results when using the Clang compiler with Visual Studio.\n\n4. Fixed a floating point exception (CVE-2021-20205) that occurred when attempting to compress a specially-crafted malformed GIF image with a specified image width of 0 using cjpeg.\n\n5. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] whereby attempting to generate a progressive JPEG image on an SSE2-capable CPU using a scan script containing one or more scans with lengths divisible by 32 and non-zero successive approximation low bit positions would, under certain circumstances, result in an error (\"Missing Huffman code table entry\") and an invalid JPEG image.\n\n6. Introduced a new flag (`TJFLAG_LIMITSCANS` in the TurboJPEG C API and `TJ.FLAG_LIMIT_SCANS` in the TurboJPEG Java API) and a corresponding TJBench command-line argument (`-limitscans`) that causes the TurboJPEG decompression and transform functions/operations to return/throw an error if a progressive JPEG image contains an unreasonably large number of scans.  This allows applications that use the TurboJPEG API to guard against an exploit of the progressive JPEG format described in the report [\"Two Issues with the JPEG Standard\"](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/TwoIssueswiththeJPEGStandard.pdf).\n\n7. The PPM reader now throws an error, rather than segfaulting (due to a buffer overrun, CVE-2021-46822) or generating incorrect pixels, if an application attempts to use the `tjLoadImage()` function to load a 16-bit binary PPM file (a binary PPM file with a maximum value greater than 255) into a grayscale image buffer or to load a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB image buffer.\n\n8. Fixed an issue in the PPM reader that caused incorrect pixels to be generated when using the `tjLoadImage()` function to load a 16-bit binary PPM file into an extended RGB image buffer.\n\n9. Fixed an issue whereby, if a JPEG buffer was automatically re-allocated by one of the TurboJPEG compression or transform functions and an error subsequently occurred during compression or transformation, the JPEG buffer pointer passed by the application was not updated when the function

The build system, x86-64 SIMD extensions, and accelerated Huffman codec now support the x32 ABI on Linux, which allows for using x86-64 instructions with 32-bit pointers.  The x32 ABI is generally enabled by adding `-mx32` to the compiler flags.\n\n     Caveats:\n     - CMake 3.9.0 or later is required in order for the build system to automatically detect an x32 build.\n     - Java does not support the x32 ABI, and thus the TurboJPEG Java API will automatically be disabled with x32 builds.\n\n2. Added Loongson MMI SIMD implementations of the RGB-to-grayscale, 4:2:2 fancy chroma upsampling, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 merged chroma upsampling/color conversion, and fast integer DCT/IDCT algorithms.  Relative to libjpeg-turbo 2.0.x, this speeds up:\n\n     - the compression of RGB source images into grayscale JPEG images by approximately 20%\n     - the decompression of 4:2:2 JPEG images by approximately 40-60% when using fancy upsampling\n     - the decompression of 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 JPEG images by approximately 15-20% when using merged upsampling\n     - the compression of RGB source images by approximately 30-45% when using the fast integer DCT\n     - the decompression of JPEG images into RGB destination images by approximately 2x when using the fast integer IDCT\n\n    The overall decompression speedup for RGB images is now approximately 2.3-3.7x (compared to 2-3.5x with libjpeg-turbo 2.0.x.)\n\n3. 32-bit (Armv7 or Armv7s) iOS builds of libjpeg-turbo are no longer supported, and the libjpeg-turbo build system can no longer be used to package such builds.  32-bit iOS apps cannot run in iOS 11 and later, and the App Store no longer allows them.\n\n4. 32-bit (i386) OS X/macOS builds of libjpeg-turbo are no longer supported, and the libjpeg-turbo build system can no longer be used to package such builds.  32-bit Mac applications cannot run in macOS 10.15 \"Catalina\" and later, and the App Store no longer allows them.\n\n5. The SSE2 (x86 SIMD) and C Huffman encoding algorithms have been significantly optimized, resulting in a measured average overall compression speedup of 12-28% for 64-bit code and 22-52% for 32-bit code on various Intel and AMD CPUs, as well as a measured average overall compression speedup of 0-23% on platforms that do not have a SIMD-accelerated Huffman encoding implementation.\n\n6. The block smoothing algorithm that is applied by default when decompressing progressive Huffman-encoded JPEG images has been improved in the following ways:\n\n     - The algorithm is now more fault-tolerant.  Previously, if a particular scan was incomplete, then the smoothing parameters for the incomplete scan would be applied to the entire output image, including the parts of the image that were generated by the prior (complete) scan.  Visually, this had the effect of removing block smoothing from lower-frequency scans if they were followed by an incomplete higher-frequency scan.  libjpeg-turbo now applies block smoothing parameters to each iMCU row based on which scan generated the pixels in that row, rather than always using the block smoothing parameters for the most recent scan.\n     - When applying block smoothing to DC scans, a Gaussian-like kernel with a 5x5 window is used to reduce the \"blocky\" appearance.\n\n7. Added SIMD acceleration for progressive Huffman encoding on Arm platforms. This speeds up the compression of full-color progressive JPEGs by about 30-40% on average (relative to libjpeg-turbo 2.0.x) when using modern Arm CPUs.\n\n8. Added configure-time and run-time auto-detection of Loongson MMI SIMD instructions, so that the Loongson MMI SIMD extensions can be included in any MIPS64 libjpeg-turbo build.\n\n9. Added fault tolerance features to djpeg and jpegtran, mainly to demonstrate methods by which applications can guard against the exploits of the JPEG format described in the report [\"Two Issues with the JPEG Standard\"](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/TwoIssueswiththeJPEGStandard.pdf).\n\n     - Both programs now accept a `-maxscans` argument, which can be used to limit the number of allowable scans in the input file.\n     - Both programs now accept a `-strict` argument, which can be used to treat all warnings as fatal.\n\n10. CMake package config files are now included for both the libjpeg and TurboJPEG API libraries.  This facilitates using libjpeg-turbo with CMake's `find_package()` function.  For example:\n\n        find_package(libjpeg-turbo CONFIG REQUIRED)\n\n        add_executable(libjpeg_program libjpeg_program.c)\n        target_link_libraries(libjpeg_program PUBLIC libjpeg-turbo::jpeg)\n\n        add_executable(libjpeg_program_static libjpeg_program.c)\n        target_link_libraries(libjpeg_program_static PUBLIC\n          libjpeg-turbo::jpeg-static)\n\n        add_executable(turbojpeg_program turbojpeg_program.c)\n        target_link_libraries(turbojpeg_program PUBLIC\n          libjpeg-turbo::turbojpeg)\n\n        add_executable(turbojpeg_program_static turbojpeg_program.c)\n        target_link_libraries(turbojpeg_program_static PUBLIC\n          libjpeg-turbo::turbojpeg-static)\n\n11. Since the Unisys LZW patent has long expired, cjpeg and djpeg can now read/write both LZW-compressed and uncompressed GIF files (feature ported from jpeg-6a and jpeg-9d.)\n\n12. jpegtran now includes the `-wipe` and `-drop` options from jpeg-9a and jpeg-9d, as well as the ability to expand the image size using the `-crop` option.  Refer to jpegtran.1 or usage.txt for more details.\n\n13. Added a complete intrinsics implementation of the Arm Neon SIMD extensions, thus providing SIMD acceleration on Arm platforms for all of the algorithms that are SIMD-accelerated on x86 platforms.  This new implementation is significantly faster in some cases than the old GAS implementation-- depending on the algorithms used, the type of CPU core, and the compiler.  GCC, as of this writing, does not provide a full or optimal set of Neon intrinsics, so for performance reasons, the default when building libjpeg-turbo with GCC is to continue using the GAS implementation of the following algorithms:\n\n     - 32-bit RGB-to-YCbCr color conversion\n     - 32-bit fast and accurate inverse DCT\n     - 64-bit RGB-to-YCbCr and YCbCr-to-RGB color conversion\n     - 64-bit accurate forward and inverse DCT\n     - 64-bit Huffman encoding\n\n    A new CMake variable (`NEON_INTRINSICS`) can be used to override this default.\n\n    Since the new intrinsics implementation includes SIMD acceleration for merged upsampling/color conversion, 1.5.1[5] is no longer necessary and has been reverted.\n\n14. The Arm Neon SIMD extensions can now be built using Visual Studio.\n\n15.

The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [EOL](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 2.0.5:\n\n1. Fixed \"using JNI after critical get\" errors that occurred on Android platforms when using any of the YUV encoding/compression/decompression/decoding methods in the TurboJPEG Java API.\n\n2. Fixed or worked around multiple issues with `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`:\n\n     - Fixed segfaults (CVE-2020-35538) or \"Corrupt JPEG data: premature end of data segment\" errors in `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` that occurred when decompressing 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 JPEG images using merged (non-fancy) upsampling/color conversion (that is, when setting `cinfo.do_fancy_upsampling` to `FALSE`.)  2.0.0[6] was a similar fix, but it did not cover all cases.\n     - `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` now throws an error if two-pass color quantization is enabled.  Two-pass color quantization never worked properly with `jpeg_skip_scanlines()`, and the issues could not readily be fixed.\n     - Fixed an issue whereby `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` always returned 0 when skipping past the end of an image.\n\n3. The Arm 64-bit (Armv8) Neon SIMD extensions can now be built using MinGW toolchains targetting Arm64 (AArch64) Windows binaries.\n\n4. Fixed unexpected visual artifacts that occurred when using `jpeg_crop_scanline()` and interblock smoothing while decompressing only the DC scan of a progressive JPEG image.\n\n5. Fixed an issue whereby libjpeg-turbo would not build if 12-bit-per-component JPEG support (`WITH_12BIT`) was enabled along with libjpeg v7 or libjpeg v8 API/ABI emulation (`WITH_JPEG7` or

Worked around issues in the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions that caused failures in the libjpeg-turbo regression tests.  Specifically, the `jsimd_h2v1_downsample_dspr2()` and `jsimd_h2v2_downsample_dspr2()` functions in the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions are now disabled until/unless they can be fixed, and other functions that are incompatible with big endian MIPS CPUs are disabled when building libjpeg-turbo for such CPUs.\n\n2. Fixed an oversight in the `TJCompressor.compress(int)` method in the TurboJPEG Java API that caused an error (\"java.lang.IllegalStateException: No source image is associated with this instance\") when attempting to use that method to compress a YUV image.\n\n3. Fixed an issue (CVE-2020-13790) in the PPM reader that caused a buffer overrun in cjpeg, TJBench, or the `tjLoadImage()` function if one of the values in a binary PPM/PGM input file exceeded the maximum value defined in the file's header and that maximum value was less than 255.  libjpeg-turbo 1.5.0 already included a similar fix for binary PPM/PGM files with maximum values greater than 255.\n\n4. The TurboJPEG API library's global error handler, which is used in functions such as `tjBufSize()` and `tjLoadImage()` that do not require a TurboJPEG instance handle, is now thread-safe on platforms that support thread-local storage.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/22528282","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/22528282/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/22528282/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/2.0.4","id":22528282,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIyNTI4Mjgy","tag_name":"2.0.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"2.0.4","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-12-31T07:10:30Z","published_at":"2019-12-31T08:19:39Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137913794","id":137913794,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOGXC","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.4-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1236712,"download_count":8,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:15:34Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:15:35Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.0.4/libjpeg-turbo-2.0.4-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137913891","id":137913891,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOGYj","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.4-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1447056,"download_count":4,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:15:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:15:52Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.0.4/libjpeg-turbo-2.0.4-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137913875","id":137913875,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOGYT","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.4-jws.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","follow

Fixed a regression in the Windows packaging system (introduced by 2.0 beta1[2]) whereby, if both the 64-bit libjpeg-turbo SDK for GCC and the 64-bit libjpeg-turbo SDK for Visual C++ were installed on the same system, only one of them could be uninstalled.\n\n2. Fixed a signed integer overflow and subsequent segfault that occurred when attempting to decompress images with more than 715827882 pixels using the 64-bit C version of TJBench.\n\n3. Fixed out-of-bounds write in `tjDecompressToYUV2()` and `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()` (sometimes manifesting as a double free) that occurred when attempting to decompress grayscale JPEG images that were compressed with a sampling factor other than 1 (for instance, with `cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2`).\n\n4. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0.2[5] that caused the TurboJPEG API to incorrectly identify some JPEG images with unusual sampling factors as 4:4:4 JPEG images.  This was known to cause a buffer overflow when attempting to decompress some such images using `tjDecompressToYUV2()` or `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`.\n\n5. Fixed an issue (CVE-2020-17541), detected by ASan, whereby attempting to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image containing an extremely-high-frequency coefficient block (junk image data that could never be generated by a legitimate JPEG compressor) could cause the Huffman encoder's local buffer to be overrun. (Refer to 1.4.0[9] and 1.4beta1[15].)  Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the stack and did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior, and given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.\n\n6. The Arm 64-bit (Armv8) Neon SIMD assembly code now stores constants in a separate read-only data section rather than in the text section, to support execute-only memory

**libjpeg-turbo-2.0.3.tar.gz** is the official source tarball for this release.  The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\n\n#### Packaging Changes\n\n- Fixed a regression introduced in libjpeg-turbo 2.0.1 whereby the libjpeg-turbo static libraries (**libjpeg.a** and **libturbojpeg.a**) could not be used with MinGW GCC v4-v6 toolchains.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [EOL](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 2.0.2:\n\n1. Fixed \"using JNI after critical get\" errors that occurred on Android platforms when passing invalid arguments to certain methods in the TurboJPEG Java API.\n\n2. Fixed a regression in the SIMD feature detection code, introduced by the AVX2 SIMD extensions (2.0 beta1[1]), that was known to cause an illegal instruction exception, in rare cases, on CPUs that lack support for CPUID leaf 07H (or on which the maximum CPUID leaf has been limited by way of a BIOS setting.)\n\n3. The 4:4:0 (h1v2) fancy (smooth) chroma upsampling algorithm in the decompressor now uses a similar bias pattern to that of the 4:2:2 (h2v1) fancy chroma upsampling algorithm, rounding up or down the upsampled result for alternate pixels rather than always rounding down.  This ensures that, regardless of whether a 4:2:2 JPEG image is rotated or transposed prior to decompression (in the frequency domain) or after decompression (in the spatial domain), the final image will be similar.\n\n4. Fixed an integer overflow and subsequent segfault that occurred when attempting to compress or decompress images with more than 1 billion pixels using the TurboJPEG API.\n\n5. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] whereby attempting to generate a progressive JPEG image on an SSE2-capable CPU using a scan script containing one or more scans with lengths divisible by 16 would result in an error (\"Missing Huffman code table entry\") and an invalid JPEG image.\n\n6. Fixed an issue whereby `tjDecodeYUV()` and `tjDecodeYUVPlanes()` would throw an error (\"Invalid progressive parameters\") or a warning (\"Inconsistent progression sequence\") if passed a TurboJPEG

Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0.1[5] that prevented a runtime search path (rpath) from being embedded in the libjpeg-turbo shared libraries and executables for macOS and iOS.  This caused a fatal error of the form \"dyld: Library not loaded\" when attempting to use one of the executables, unless `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` was explicitly set to the location of the libjpeg-turbo shared libraries.\n\n2. Fixed an integer overflow and subsequent segfault (CVE-2018-20330) that occurred when attempting to load a BMP file with more than 1 billion pixels using the `tjLoadImage()` function.\n\n3. Fixed a buffer overrun (CVE-2018-19664) that occurred when attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image to a 256-color BMP using djpeg.\n\n4. Fixed a floating point exception that occurred when attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image with a specified image width or height of 0 using the C version of TJBench.\n\n5. The TurboJPEG API will now decompress 4:4:4 JPEG images with 2x1, 1x2, 3x1, or 1x3 luminance and chrominance sampling factors.  This is a non-standard way of specifying 1x subsampling (normally 4:4:4 JPEGs have 1x1 luminance and chrominance sampling factors), but the JPEG format and the libjpeg API both allow it.\n\n6. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[7] that caused djpeg to generate incorrect PPM images when used with the `-colors` option.\n\n7. Fixed an issue whereby a static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which `ENABLE_SHARED` is `0`) could not be installed using the Visual Studio IDE.\n\n8. Fixed a severe performance issue in the Loongson MMI SIMD extensions that occurred when compressing RGB images whose image rows were not 64-bit-aligned.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/13961257","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/13961257/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/13961257/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/2.0.1","id":13961257,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEzOTYxMjU3","tag_name":"2.0.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"2.0.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-11-12T19:20:28Z","published_at":"2018-11-12T20:30:31Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137911557","id":137911557,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOF0F","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.1-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1666960,"download_count":6,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:07:28Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:07:29Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.0.1/libjpeg-turbo-2.0.1-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137911428","id":137911428,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOFyE","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.1-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1887504,"download_count":6,"created_at":"2023-11-28T22:07:12Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T22:07:14Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/2.0.1/libjpeg-turbo-2.0.1-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137911426","id":137911426,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOFyC","name":"libjpeg-turbo-2.0.1-jws.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers",

Fixed a regression introduced with the new CMake-based Un*x build system, whereby jconfig.h could cause compiler warnings of the form `\"HAVE_*_H\" redefined` if it was included by downstream Autotools-based projects that used `AC_CHECK_HEADERS()` to check for the existence of locale.h, stddef.h, or stdlib.h.\n\n2. The `jsimd_quantize_float_dspr2()` and `jsimd_convsamp_float_dspr2()` functions in the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions are now disabled at compile time if the soft float ABI is enabled.  Those functions use instructions that are incompatible with the soft float ABI.\n\n3. Fixed a regression in the SIMD feature detection code, introduced by the AVX2 SIMD extensions (2.0 beta1[1]), that caused libjpeg-turbo to crash on Windows 7 if Service Pack 1 was not installed.\n\n4. Fixed out-of-bounds read in cjpeg that occurred when attempting to compress a specially-crafted malformed color-index (8-bit-per-sample) Targa file in which some of the samples (color indices) exceeded the bounds of the Targa file's color table.\n\n5. Fixed an issue whereby installing a fully static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which `CFLAGS` contains `-static` and `ENABLE_SHARED` is `0`) would fail with \"No valid ELF RPATH or RUNPATH entry

The TurboJPEG API can now decompress CMYK JPEG images that have subsampled M and Y components (not to be confused with YCCK JPEG images, in which the C/M/Y components have been transformed into luma and chroma.)   Previously, an error was generated (\"Could not determine subsampling type for JPEG image\") when such an image was passed to `tjDecompressHeader3()`, `tjTransform()`, `tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()`, `tjDecompressToYUV2()`, or the equivalent Java methods.\n\n2. Fixed an issue (CVE-2018-11813) whereby a specially-crafted malformed input file (specifically, a file with a valid Targa header but incomplete pixel data) would cause cjpeg to generate a JPEG file that was potentially thousands of times larger than the input file.  The Targa reader in cjpeg was not properly detecting that the end of the input file had been reached prematurely, so after all valid pixels had been read from the input, the reader injected dummy pixels with values of 255 into the JPEG compressor until the number of pixels specified in the Targa header had been compressed.  The Targa reader in cjpeg now behaves like the PPM reader and aborts compression if the end of the input file is reached prematurely.  Because this issue only affected cjpeg and not the underlying library, and because it did not involve any out-of-bounds reads or other exploitable behaviors, it was not believed to represent a security threat.\n\n3. Fixed an issue whereby the `tjLoadImage()` and `tjSaveImage()` functions would produce a \"Bogus message code\" error message if the underlying bitmap and PPM readers/writers threw an error that was specific to the readers/writers (as opposed to a general libjpeg API error.)\n\n4. Fixed an issue (CVE-2018-1152) whereby a specially-crafted malformed BMP file, one in which the header specified an image width of 1073741824 pixels, would trigger a floating point exception (division by zero) in the `tjLoadImage()` function when attempting to load the BMP file into a 4-component image buffer.\n\n5. Fixed an issue whereby certain combinations of calls to `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` and `jpeg_read_scanlines()` could trigger an infinite loop when decompressing progressive JPEG images that use vertical chroma subsampling (for instance, 4:2:0 or 4:4:0.)\n\n6. Fixed a segfault in `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` that occurred when decompressing a 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 JPEG image using the merged (non-fancy) upsampling algorithms (that is, when setting `cinfo.do_fancy_upsampling` to `FALSE`.)\n\n7. The new CMake-based build system will now disable the MIPS DSPr2 SIMD extensions if it detects that the compiler does not support DSPr2 instructions.\n\n8. Fixed out-of-bounds read in cjpeg (CVE-2018-14498) that occurred when attempting to compress a specially-crafted malformed color-index (8-bit-per-sample) BMP file in which some of the samples (color indices) exceeded the bounds of the BMP file's color table.\n\n9. Fixed a signed integer overflow in the progressive Huffman decoder, detected by the Clang and GCC undefined behavior sanitizers, that could be triggered by attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.  This issue did not pose a security threat, but removing the warning made it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/12144011/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/10243155","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/10243155/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/10243155/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/1.5.90","id":10243155,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEwMjQzMTU1","tag_name":"1.5.90","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.5.90

Added AVX2 SIMD implementations of the colorspace conversion, chroma downsampling and upsampling, integer quantization and sample conversion, and accurate integer DCT/IDCT algorithms.  When using the accurate integer DCT/IDCT algorithms on AVX2-equipped CPUs, the compression of RGB images is approximately 13-36% (avg. 22%) faster (relative to libjpeg-turbo 1.5.x) with 64-bit code and 11-21% (avg. 17%) faster with 32-bit code, and the decompression of RGB images is approximately 9-35% (avg. 17%) faster with 64-bit code and 7-17% (avg. 12%) faster with 32-bit code.  (As tested on a 3 GHz Intel Core i7.  Actual mileage may vary.)\n\n2. Overhauled the build system to use CMake on all platforms, and removed the autotools-based build system.  This decision resulted from extensive discussions within the libjpeg-turbo community.  libjpeg-turbo traditionally used CMake only for Windows builds, but there was an increasing amount of demand to extend CMake support to other platforms.  However, because of the unique nature of our code base (the need to support different assemblers on each platform, the need for Java support, etc.), providing dual build systems as other OSS imaging libraries do (including libpng and libtiff) would have created a maintenance burden.  The use of CMake greatly simplifies some aspects of our build system, owing to CMake's built-in support for various assemblers, Java, and unit testing, as well as generally fewer quirks that have to be worked around in order to implement our packaging system.  Eliminating autotools puts our project slightly at odds with the traditional practices of the OSS community, since most \"system libraries\" tend to be built with autotools, but it is believed that the benefits of this move outweigh the risks.  In addition to providing a unified build environment, switching to CMake allows for the use of various build tools and IDEs that aren't supported under autotools, including XCode, Ninja, and Eclipse.  It also eliminates the need to install autotools via MacPorts/Homebrew on OS X and allows libjpeg-turbo to be configured without the use of a terminal/command prompt. Extensive testing was conducted to ensure that all features provided by the autotools-based build system are provided by the new build system.\n\n3. The libjpeg API in this version of libjpeg-turbo now includes two additional functions, `jpeg_read_icc_profile()` and `jpeg_write_icc_profile()`, that can be used to extract ICC profile data from a JPEG file while decompressing or to embed ICC profile data in a JPEG file while compressing or transforming.  This eliminates the need for downstream projects, such as color management libraries and browsers, to include their own glueware for accomplishing this.\n\n4. Improved error handling in the TurboJPEG API library:\n\n     - Introduced a new function (`tjGetErrorStr2()`) in the TurboJPEG C API that allows compression/decompression/transform error messages to be retrieved in a thread-safe manner.  Retrieving error messages from global functions, such as `tjInitCompress()` or `tjBufSize()`, is still thread-unsafe, but since those functions will only throw errors if passed an invalid argument or if a memory allocation failure occurs, thread safety is not as much of a concern.\n     - Introduced a new function (`tjGetErrorCode()`) in the TurboJPEG C API and a new method (`TJException.getErrorCode()`) in the TurboJPEG Java API that can be used to determine the severity of the last compression/decompression/transform error.  This allows applications to choose whether to ignore warnings (non-fatal errors) from the underlying libjpeg API or to treat them as fatal.\n     - Introduced a new flag (`TJFLAG_STOPONWARNING` in the TurboJPEG C API and `TJ.FLAG_STOPONWARNING` in the TurboJPEG Java API) that causes the library to immediately halt a compression/decompression/transform operation if it encounters a warning from the underlying libjpeg API (the default behavior is to allow the operation to complete unless a fatal error is encountered.)\n\n5. Introduced a new flag in the TurboJPEG C and Java APIs (`TJFLAG_PROGRESSIVE` and `TJ.FLAG_PROGRESSIVE`, respectively) that causes compression and transform operations to generate progressive JPEG images.  Additionally, a new transform option (`TJXOPT_PROGRESSIVE` in the C API and `TJTransform.OPT_PROGRESSIVE` in the Java API) has been introduced, allowing progressive JPEG images to be generated by selected transforms in a multi-transform operation.\n\n6. Introduced a new transform option in the TurboJPEG API (`TJXOPT_COPYNONE` in the C API and `TJTransform.OPT_COPYNONE` in the Java API) that allows the copying of markers (including Exif and ICC profile data) to be disabled for a particular transform.\n\n7. Added two functions to the TurboJPEG C API (`tjLoadImage()` and `tjSaveImage()`) that can be used to load/save a BMP or PPM/PGM image to/from a memory buffer with a specified pixel format and layout.  These functions replace the project-private (and slow) bmp API, which was previously used by TJBench, and they also provide a convenient way for first-time users of libjpeg-turbo to quickly develop a complete JPEG compression/decompression program.\n\n8. The TurboJPEG C API now includes a new convenience array (`tjAlphaOffset[]`) that contains the alpha component index for each pixel format (or -1 if the pixel format lacks an alpha component.)  The TurboJPEG Java API now includes a new method (`TJ.getAlphaOffset()`) that returns the same value.  In addition, the `tjRedOffset[]`, `tjGreenOffset[]`, and `tjBlueOffset[]` arrays-- and the corresponding `TJ.getRedOffset()`, `TJ.getGreenOffset()`, and `TJ.getBlueOffset()` methods-- now return -1 for `TJPF_GRAY`/`TJ.PF_GRAY` rather than 0.  This allows programs to easily determine whether a pixel format has red, green, blue, and alpha components.\n\n9. Added a new example (tjexample.c) that demonstrates the basic usage of the TurboJPEG C API.  This example mirrors the functionality of TJExample.java. Both files are now included in the libjpeg-turbo documentation.\n\n10. Fixed two signed integer overflows in the arithmetic decoder, detected by the Clang undefined behavior sanitizer, that could be triggered by attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.  These issues did not pose a security threat, but removing the warnings makes it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n\n11. Fixed a bug in the merged 4:2:0 upsampling/dithered RGB565 color conversion algorithm that caused incorrect dithering in the output image.  This algorithm now produces bitwise-identical results to the unmerged algorithms.\n\n12. The SIMD function symbols for x86[-64]/ELF, MIPS/ELF, macOS/x86[-64] (if libjpeg-turbo is built with Yasm), and iOS/Arm[64] builds are now private. This prevents those symbols from being exposed in applications or shared libraries that link statically with libjpeg-turbo.\n\n13. Added Loongson MMI SIMD implementations of the RGB-to-YCbCr and YCbCr-to-RGB colorspace conversion, 4:2:0 chroma downsampling, 4:2:0 fancy chroma upsampling, integer quantization, and accurate integer DCT/IDCT algorithms.  When using the accurate integer DCT/IDCT, this speeds up the compression of RGB images by approximately 70-100% and the decompression of RGB images by approximately 2-3.5x.\n\n14. Fixed a build error when building with older MinGW releases (regression caused by 1.5.1[7].)\n\n15. Added SIMD acceleration for progressive Huffman encoding on SSE2-capable x86 and x86-64 platforms.  This speeds up the compression of full-color progressive JPEGs by about 85-90% on average (relative to libjpeg-turbo 1.5.x) when using modern Intel and AMD CPUs.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/8900187","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/8900187/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/8900187/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/1.5.3","id":8900187,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTg5MDAxODc=","tag_name":"1.5.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.5.3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-12-14T04:38:06Z","published_at":"2017-12-14T06:08:53Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137909600","id":137909600,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOFVg","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.3-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1695368,"download_count":5,"created_at":"2023-11-28T21:54:19Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T21:54:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/1.5.3/libjpeg-turbo-1.5.3-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137909652","id":137909652,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOFWU","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.3-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1963784,"download_count":7,"created_at":"2023-11-28T21:54:28Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T21:54:29Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/1.5.3/libjpeg-turbo-1.5.3-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137909709","id":137909709,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOFXN","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.3-jws.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url

The automatically generated \"Source code\" assets are not supported.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Downloads/DigitalSignatures> for information regarding the methods used to sign the files in this release and instructions for verifying the signatures.\n- Refer to <https://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/OfficialBinaries> for information regarding the compatibility of the binary packages in this release.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCode Quality: [Stable](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning) \\\nCurrent Support Category: [EOL](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/DeveloperInfo/Versioning)\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\n### Significant changes relative to 1.5.2:\n\n1. Fixed a NullPointerException in the TurboJPEG Java wrapper that occurred when using the YUVImage constructor that creates an instance backed by separate image planes and allocates memory for the image planes.\n\n2. Fixed an issue whereby the Java version of TJUnitTest would fail when testing BufferedImage encoding/decoding on big endian systems.\n\n3. Fixed a segfault in djpeg that would occur if an output format other than PPM/PGM was selected along with the `-crop` option.  The `-crop` option now works with the GIF and Targa formats as well (unfortunately, it cannot be made to work with the BMP and RLE formats due to the fact that those output engines write scanlines in bottom-up order.)  djpeg will now exit gracefully if an output format other than PPM/PGM, GIF, or Targa is selected along with the `-crop` option.\n\n4. Fixed an issue (CVE-2017-15232) whereby `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` would segfault if color quantization was enabled.\n\n5. TJBench (both C and Java versions) will now display usage information if any command-line argument is unrecognized.  This prevents the program from silently ignoring typos.\n\n6. Fixed an access violation in tjbench.exe (Windows) that occurred when the program was used to decompress an existing JPEG image.\n\n7. Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the TJExample Java program that occurred when attempting to decompress a JPEG image that had been compressed with 4:1:1 chrominance subsampling.\n\n8. Fixed an issue whereby, when using `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` to skip to the end of a single-scan (non-progressive) image, subsequent calls to `jpeg_consume_input()` would return `JPEG_SUSPENDED` rather than `JPEG_REACHED_EOI`.\n\n9. `jpeg_crop_scanline()` now works correctly when decompressing grayscale JPEG images that were compressed with a sampling factor other than 1 (for instance, with `cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2`).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/6970958","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/6970958/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/6970958/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/1.5.2","id":6970958,"author":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTY5NzA5NTg=","tag_name":"1.5.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.5.2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-07-07T21:52:46Z","published_at":"2017-08-09T21:30:41Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137907279","id":137907279,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOExP","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.2-gcc.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1695016,"download_count":8,"created_at":"2023-11-28T21:40:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T21:40:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/1.5.2/libjpeg-turbo-1.5.2-gcc.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137907324","id":137907324,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOEx8","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.2-gcc64.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-ms-dos-executable","state":"uploaded","size":1963640,"download_count":5,"created_at":"2023-11-28T21:40:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T21:40:52Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/download/1.5.2/libjpeg-turbo-1.5.2-gcc64.exe"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/assets/137907310","id":137907310,"node_id":"RA_kwDOAl6yRs4IOExu","name":"libjpeg-turbo-1.5.2-jws.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"dcommander","id":651941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander","html_url":"https://github.com/dcommander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcommander/followers","following_ur

Fixed a regression introduced by 1.5.1[7] that prevented libjpeg-turbo from building with Android NDK platforms prior to android-21 (5.0).\n\n2. Fixed a regression introduced by 1.5.1[1] that prevented the MIPS DSPR2 SIMD code in libjpeg-turbo from building.\n\n3. Fixed a regression introduced by 1.5 beta1[11] that prevented the Java version of TJBench from outputting any reference images (the `-nowrite` switch was accidentally enabled by default.)\n\n4. libjpeg-turbo should now build and run with full AltiVec SIMD acceleration on PowerPC-based AmigaOS 4 and OpenBSD systems.\n\n5. Fixed build and runtime errors on Windows that occurred when building libjpeg-turbo with libjpeg v7 API/ABI emulation and the in-memory source/destination managers.  Due to an oversight, the `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` and `jpeg_crop_scanline()` functions were not being included in jpeg7.dll when libjpeg-turbo was built with `-DWITH_JPEG7=1` and `-DWITH_MEMSRCDST=1`.\n\n6. Fixed \"Bogus virtual array access\" error that occurred when using the lossless crop feature in jpegtran or the TurboJPEG API, if libjpeg-turbo was built with libjpeg v7 API/ABI emulation.  This was apparently a long-standing bug that has existed since the introduction of libjpeg v7/v8 API/ABI emulation in libjpeg-turbo v1.1.\n\n7. The lossless transform features in jpegtran and the TurboJPEG API will now always attempt to adjust the Exif image width and height tags if the image size changed as a result of the transform.  This behavior has always existed when using libjpeg v8 API/ABI emulation.  It was supposed to be available with libjpeg v7 API/ABI emulation as well but did not work properly due to a bug. Furthermore, there was never any good reason not to enable it with libjpeg v6b API/ABI emulation, since the behavior is entirely internal.  Note that `-copy all` must be passed to jpegtran in order to transfer the Exif tags from the source image to the destination image.\n\n8. Fixed several memory leaks in the TurboJPEG API library that could occur if the library was built with certain compilers and optimization levels (known to occur with GCC 4.x and clang with `-O1` and higher but not with GCC 5.x or 6.x) and one of the underlying libjpeg API functions threw an error after a TurboJPEG API function allocated a local buffer.\n\n9. The libjpeg-turbo memory manager will now honor the `max_memory_to_use` structure member in jpeg\\_memory\\_mgr, which can be set to the maximum amount of memory (in bytes) that libjpeg-turbo should use during decompression or multi-pass (including progressive) compression.  This limit can also be set using the `JPEGMEM` environment variable or using the `-maxmemory` switch in cjpeg/djpeg/jpegtran (refer to the respective man pages for more details.) This has been a documented feature of libjpeg since v5, but the `malloc()`/`free()` implementation of the memory manager (jmemnobs.c) never implemented the feature.  Restricting libjpeg-turbo's memory usage is useful for two reasons:  it allows testers to more easily work around the 2 GB limit in libFuzzer, and it allows developers of security-sensitive applications to more easily defend against one of the progressive JPEG exploits (LJT-01-004) identified in [this report](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/TwoIssueswiththeJPEGStandard.pdf).\n\n10. TJBench will now run each benchmark for 1 second prior to starting the timer, in order to improve the consistency of the results.  Furthermore, the `-warmup` option is now used to specify the amount of warmup time rather than the number of warmup iterations.\n\n11. Fixed an error (`short jump is out of range`) that occurred when assembling the 32-bit x86 SIMD extensions with NASM versions prior to 2.04.  This was a regression introduced by 1.5

Previously, the undocumented `JSIMD_FORCE*` environment variables could be used to force-enable a particular SIMD instruction set if multiple instruction sets were available on a particular platform.  On x86 platforms, where CPU feature detection is bulletproof and multiple SIMD instruction sets are available, it makes sense for those environment variables to allow forcing the use of an instruction set only if that instruction set is available.  However, since the ARM implementations of libjpeg-turbo can only use one SIMD instruction set, and since their feature detection code is less bulletproof (parsing /proc/cpuinfo), it makes sense for the `JSIMD_FORCENEON` environment variable to bypass the feature detection code and really force the use of NEON instructions.  A new environment variable (`JSIMD_FORCEDSPR2`) was introduced in the MIPS implementation for the same reasons, and the existing `JSIMD_FORCENONE` environment variable was extended to that implementation. These environment variables provide a workaround for those attempting to test ARM and MIPS builds of libjpeg-turbo in QEMU, which passes through /proc/cpuinfo from the host system.\n\n2. libjpeg-turbo previously assumed that AltiVec instructions were always available on PowerPC platforms, which led to \"illegal instruction\" errors when running on PowerPC chips that lack AltiVec support (such as the older 7xx/G3 and newer e5500 series.)  libjpeg-turbo now examines /proc/cpuinfo on Linux/Android systems and enables AltiVec instructions only if the CPU supports them.  It also now provides two environment variables, `JSIMD_FORCEALTIVEC` and `JSIMD_FORCENONE`, to force-enable and force-disable AltiVec instructions in environments where /proc/cpuinfo is an unreliable means of CPU feature detection (such as when running in QEMU.)  On OS X, libjpeg-turbo continues to assume that AltiVec support is always available, which means that libjpeg-turbo cannot be used with G3 Macs unless you set the environment variable `JSIMD_FORCENONE` to `1`.\n\n3. Fixed an issue whereby 64-bit ARM (AArch64) builds of libjpeg-turbo would crash when built with recent releases of the Clang/LLVM compiler.  This was caused by an ABI conformance issue in some of libjpeg-turbo's 64-bit NEON SIMD routines.  Those routines were incorrectly using 64-bit instructions to transfer a 32-bit JDIMENSION argument, whereas the ABI allows the upper (unused) 32 bits of a 32-bit argument's register to be undefined.  The new Clang/LLVM optimizer uses load combining to transfer multiple adjacent 32-bit structure members into a single 64-bit register, and this exposed the ABI conformance issue.\n\n4. Fancy upsampling is now supported when decompressing JPEG images that use 4:4:0 (h1v2) chroma subsampling.  These images are generated when losslessly rotating or transposing JPEG images that use 4:2:2 (h2v1) chroma subsampling. The h1v2 fancy upsampling algorithm is not currently SIMD-accelerated.\n\n5. If merged upsampling isn't SIMD-accelerated but YCbCr-to-RGB conversion is, then libjpeg-turbo will now disable merged upsampling when decompressing YCbCr JPEG images into RGB or extended RGB output images.  This significantly speeds up the decompression of 4:2:0 and 4:2:2 JPEGs on ARM platforms if fancy upsampling is not used (for example, if the `-nosmooth` option to djpeg is specified.)\n\n6. The TurboJPEG API will now decompress 4:2:2 and 4:4:0 JPEG images with 2x2 luminance sampling factors and 2x1 or 1x2 chrominance sampling factors. This is a non-standard way of specifying 2x subsampling (normally 4:2:2 JPEGs have 2x1 luminance and 1x1 chrominance sampling factors, and 4:4:0 JPEGs have 1x2 luminance and 1x1 chrominance sampling factors), but the JPEG format and the libjpeg API both allow it.\n\n7. Fixed an unsigned integer overflow in the libjpeg memory manager, detected by the Clang undefined behavior sanitizer, that could be triggered by attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.  This issue affected only 32-bit code and did not pose a security threat, but removing the warning makes it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n\n8. Fixed additional negative left shifts and other issues reported by the GCC and Clang undefined behavior sanitizers when attempting to decompress specially-crafted malformed JPEG images.  None of these issues posed a security threat, but removing the warnings makes it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n\n9. Fixed an out-of-bounds array reference, introduced by 1.4.90[2] (partial image decompression) and detected by the Clang undefined behavior sanitizer, that could be triggered by a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image with more than four components.  Because the out-of-bounds reference was still within the same structure, it was not known to pose a security threat, but removing the warning makes it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.\n\n10. Fixed another ABI conformance issue in the 64-bit ARM (AArch64) NEON SIMD code.  Some of the routines were incorrectly reading and storing data below the stack pointer, which caused segfaults in certain applications under specific circumstances.\n"}]
