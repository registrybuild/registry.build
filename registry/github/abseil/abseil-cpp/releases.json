These matchers make it easier to write unit tests for code that uses `absl::Status`.\r\n* Patch 1 addresses a [security issue](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1) in hash container create/resize.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* [`absl::AlphaNum` no longer allows brace-initialization.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/2be67701e7a33b45d322064349827e1155953338) This was never intended to be supported, nor is it recommended that `absl::AlphaNum` ever be spelled in user code.\r\n* The deprecated symbol `absl::kuint128max` [has been removed](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/34604d5b1f6ae14c65b3992478b59f7108051979) and should be replaced with `absl::Uint128Max()`.\r\n* `absl::aligned_storage_t`, which was a polyfill consistent with `std::aligned_storage_t`, [has been removed](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/42133464db0ae5383fef723067835ef768b849f8). `std::aligned_storage_t` is deprecated in C++23. See https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1413r3.pdf for a suggested replacement.\r\n* [`absl::StrJoin` now has a `absl::string_view` overload.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/73841853760d6f86f5fe0372f17b2456874b6399) This allows for passing a collection of string-like objects without having to convert everything to the same type first.

Note that this functionality requires C++17 or newer.\r\n* [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod) is now officially supported (previously it was supported by the community).

Previously the array would decay to a pointer type, which could lead to subtle, unintended bugs. The most common potential error is passing a C-string literal. After this change, these call-sites require wrapping the literal in `absl::string_view`.\r\n* `absl::weak_equality` and `absl::strong_equality` have been removed.

Currently these serve as annotations only, but it is expected that compilers will one day be able to use these annotations for diagnostic purposes.\r\n* Added the [`prefetch`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/prefetch.h) library as a portable layer for moving data into caches before it is read.\r\n* Abseil's [hash tables](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/container) now detect many more programming errors in debug and sanitizer builds.\r\n* Abseil's synchronization objects now differentiate absolute waits (when passed an `absl::Time`) from relative waits (when passed an `absl::Duration`) when the underlying platform supports differentiating these cases. This only makes a difference when system clocks are adjusted.\r\n* Abseil's [flag parsing library](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/flags/parse.h) includes additional methods that make it easier to use when another library also expects to be able to parse flags.\r\n* `absl::string_view` is now available as a smaller target, [`@com_google_absl//absl/strings:string_view`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/1adf896ec842bd9788a1bbede94a33e1402b8ecb/absl/strings/BUILD.bazel#L30-L42), so that users may use this library without depending on the much larger `@com_google_absl//absl/strings` target.\r\n* Patch 3 addresses a [security issue](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1) in hash container create/resize.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* None known at this time.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* None known at this time.\r\n\r\nBaseline: fdf5be1108ada4b5525f48542d5fd76731cb880e\r\nCherry pick: 659b77b713fe5f1f75e6e1bb121c0eed1c8f964a\r\nCherry pick: fb3621f4f897824c0dbe0615fa94543df6192f30 (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: 11e1e5c82972eb5b78d397556f604d6b3109df3f (Patch 2)\r\nCherry pick: caa7bb4457bfcafcd55a940204ef78c1bf1f417d (Patch 3)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/168301782","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/168301782/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/168301782/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20240722.0","id":168301782,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4KCBTW","tag_name":"20240722.0","target_commitish":"lts_2024_07_22","name":"Abseil LTS branch, July 2024","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-08-01T18:05:11Z","published_at":"2024-08-01T18:09:08Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/assets/183265355","id":183265355,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBjZydc4K7GhL","name":"abseil-cpp-20240722.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":2242861,"download_count":720188,"created_at":"2024-08-01T18:09:45Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T18:09:48Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/download/20240722.0/abseil-cpp-20240722.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20240722.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20240722.0","body":"# Abseil LTS 20240722.0\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* Added [GoogleTest matchers](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status_matchers.h) for `absl::Status`. These matchers make it easier to write unit tests for code that uses `absl::Status`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* [`absl::AlphaNum` no longer allows brace-initialization.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/2be67701e7a33b45d322064349827e1155953338) This was never intended to be supported, nor is it recommended that `absl::AlphaNum` ever be spelled in user code.\r\n* The deprecated symbol `absl::kuint128max` [has been removed](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/34604d5b1f6ae14c65b3992478b59f7108051979) and should be replaced with `absl::Uint128Max()`.\r\n* `absl::aligned_storage_t`, which was a polyfill consistent with `std::aligned_storage_t`, [has been removed](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/42133464db0ae5383fef723067835ef768b849f8). `std::aligned_storage_t` is deprecated in C++23. See https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1413r3.pdf for a suggested replacement.\r\n* [`absl::StrJoin` now has a `absl::string_view` overload.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/73841853760d6f86f5fe0372f17b2456874b6399) This allows for passing a collection of string-like objects without having to convert everything to the same type first. However, this may be a breaking change for users passing an explicit template argument to `absl::StrJoin`.

Currently these serve as annotations only, but it is expected that compilers will one day be able to use these annotations for diagnostic purposes.\r\n* Added the [`prefetch`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/prefetch.h) library as a portable layer for moving data into caches before it is read.\r\n* Abseil's [hash tables](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/container) now detect many more programming errors in debug and sanitizer builds.\r\n* Abseil's synchronization objects now differentiate absolute waits (when passed an `absl::Time`) from relative waits (when passed an `absl::Duration`) when the underlying platform supports differentiating these cases. This only makes a difference when system clocks are adjusted.\r\n* Abseil's [flag parsing library](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/flags/parse.h) includes additional methods that make it easier to use when another library also expects to be able to parse flags.\r\n* `absl::string_view` is now available as a smaller target, [`@com_google_absl//absl/strings:string_view`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/1adf896ec842bd9788a1bbede94a33e1402b8ecb/absl/strings/BUILD.bazel#L30-L42), so that users may use this library without depending on the much larger `@com_google_absl//absl/strings` target.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* None known at this time.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* A [security issue](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1) was discovered in hash container create/resize.

This library provides facilities for writing short text messages about the status of a program to `stderr`, disk files, or other sinks (via an extension API). See the [logging library documentation](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/logging) for more information.\r\n* An extension point, [`AbslStringify()`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/format#abslstringify), allows user-defined types to seamlessly work with Abseil's string formatting functions like `absl::StrCat()` and `absl::StrFormat()`.\r\n* A [library for computing CRC32C checksums](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/crc/crc32c.h) has been added.\r\n* Floating-point parsing now uses the [Eisel-Lemire algorithm](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/eisel-lemire.html), which provides a significant speed improvement.\r\n* The flags library now provides suggestions for the closest flag(s) in the case of misspelled flags.\r\n* Using [CMake to install Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/308bbf300fe9332130f4784c7a91fa2ad707d6e4) now makes the installed artifacts (in particular [`absl/base/options.h`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/options.h)) reflect the compiled ABI.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* Abseil now requires at least C++14 and follows [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). See [this table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for a list of currently supported versions compilers, platforms, and build tools.\r\n* The legacy spellings of the thread annotation macros/functions (e.g. `GUARDED_BY()`) [have been removed by default](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/6acb60c161f1203e6eca929b87f2041da7714bfe) in favor of the `ABSL_` prefixed versions (e.g. `ABSL_GUARDED_BY()`) due to clashes with other libraries. The compatibility macro `ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS` can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete replacement for [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) yet. `VLOG` and `DFATAL` are examples of features that have not yet been released.\r\n\r\nBaseline: a69b0ae5cdba53a45617afc408618a3e1ac244de\r\nCherry pick: 35e8e3f7a2c6972d4c591448e8bbe4f9ed9f815a (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: a0f9b465212aea24d3264b82d315b8ee59e8d7a0 (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: 2de126cc5826a8d464270ead65a7a9a7b012b741 (Patch 2)\r\nCherry pick: 807763a7f57dcf0ba4af7c3b218013e8f525e811 (Patch 3)\r\nCherry pick: 96074ab998bf758790798f35d2a4435ba2d60a16 (Patch 4)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20220623.2","id":141681861,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4IceTF","tag_name":"20220623.2","target_commitish":"lts_2022_06_23","name":"Abseil LTS branch, June 2022, Patch 2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-02-12T19:50:36Z","published_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:30Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/assets/151184332","id":151184332,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBjZydc4JAuPM","name":"abseil-cpp-20220623.2.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1957614,"download_count":263,"created_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:56Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/download/20220623.2/abseil-cpp-20220623.2.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20220623.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20220623.2","body":"# Abseil LTS 20220623.2\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* Added [`absl::AnyInvocable`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/functional/any_invocable.h), a move-only function type.\r\n* Added [`absl::CordBuffer`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/cord_buffer.h), a type for buffering data for eventual inclusion an `absl::Cord`, which is useful for writing zero-copy code.\r\n* Added [support for command-line flags of type `absl::optional<T>`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/273292d1cfc0a94a65082ee350509af1d113344d/absl/flags/marshalling.h#L68-L102).\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* CMake builds now use the flag [`ABSL_BUILD_TESTING`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/fb7dd24b18e82893e5922be5d1c8ae0f3fe3c9fa) (default: `OFF`) to control whether or not unit tests are built.\r\n* The `ABSL_DEPRECATED` macro now works with the GCC compiler. GCC users that are experiencing new warnings can use `-Wno-deprecated-declatations` silence the warnings or use `-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations` to see warnings but not fail the build.\r\n* `ABSL_CONST_INIT` uses the C++20 keyword `constinit` when available. [Some compilers are more strict about where this keyword must appear compared to the pre-C++20 implementation.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/273292d1cfc0a94a65082ee350509af1d113344d/absl/base/attributes.h#L679-L717)\r\n* Bazel builds now depend on the [bazelbuild/bazel-skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib) repository.

Previously the array would decay to a pointer type, which could lead to subtle, unintended bugs. The most common potential error is passing a C-string literal.

The compatibility macro `ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS` can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete replacement for [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) yet. `VLOG` and `DFATAL` are examples of features that have not yet been released.\r\n\r\nBaseline: a69b0ae5cdba53a45617afc408618a3e1ac244de\r\nCherry pick: 35e8e3f7a2c6972d4c591448e8bbe4f9ed9f815a (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: a0f9b465212aea24d3264b82d315b8ee59e8d7a0 (Patch 1)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/92919178/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/90201153","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/90201153/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/90201153/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20230125.0","id":90201153,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4FYFxB","tag_name":"20230125.0","target_commitish":"lts_2023_01_25","name":"Abseil LTS branch, Jan 2023","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-01-25T16:31:08Z","published_at":"2023-01-25T16:33:25Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20230125.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20230125.0","body":"# Abseil LTS 20230125\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* The Abseil logging library has been released.
