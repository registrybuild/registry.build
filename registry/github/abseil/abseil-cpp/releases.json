Note that this functionality requires C++17 or newer.\r\n* [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod) is now officially supported (previously it was supported by the community). Note that it may take several days after the release for it to become available in the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/abseil-cpp).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* `AbslHashValue()` [no longer accepts C-style arrays as a parameter](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/1415840502f38952e63c1c6e4892f6e69ce7bc13).

This library provides facilities for writing short text messages about the status of a program to `stderr`, disk files, or other sinks (via an extension API). See the [logging library documentation](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/logging) for more information.\r\n* An extension point, [`AbslStringify()`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/format#abslstringify), allows user-defined types to seamlessly work with Abseil's string formatting functions like `absl::StrCat()` and `absl::StrFormat()`.\r\n* A [library for computing CRC32C checksums](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/crc/crc32c.h) has been added.\r\n* Floating-point parsing now uses the [Eisel-Lemire algorithm](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/eisel-lemire.html), which provides a significant speed improvement.\r\n* The flags library now provides suggestions for the closest flag(s) in the case of misspelled flags.\r\n* Using [CMake to install Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/308bbf300fe9332130f4784c7a91fa2ad707d6e4) now makes the installed artifacts (in particular [`absl/base/options.h`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/options.h)) reflect the compiled ABI.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* Abseil now requires at least C++14 and follows [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). See [this table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for a list of currently supported versions compilers, platforms, and build tools.\r\n* The legacy spellings of the thread annotation macros/functions (e.g. `GUARDED_BY()`) [have been removed by default](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/6acb60c161f1203e6eca929b87f2041da7714bfe) in favor of the `ABSL_` prefixed versions (e.g. `ABSL_GUARDED_BY()`) due to clashes with other libraries. The compatibility macro `ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS` can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete replacement for [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) yet. `VLOG` and `DFATAL` are examples of features that have not yet been released.\r\n\r\nBaseline: a69b0ae5cdba53a45617afc408618a3e1ac244de\r\nCherry pick: 35e8e3f7a2c6972d4c591448e8bbe4f9ed9f815a (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: a0f9b465212aea24d3264b82d315b8ee59e8d7a0 (Patch 1)\r\nCherry pick: 2de126cc5826a8d464270ead65a7a9a7b012b741 (Patch 2)\r\nCherry pick: 807763a7f57dcf0ba4af7c3b218013e8f525e811 (Patch 3)\r\nCherry pick: 96074ab998bf758790798f35d2a4435ba2d60a16 (Patch 4)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/141681861/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20220623.2","id":141681861,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4IceTF","tag_name":"20220623.2","target_commitish":"lts_2022_06_23","name":"Abseil LTS branch, June 2022, Patch 2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-02-12T19:50:36Z","published_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:30Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/assets/151184332","id":151184332,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBjZydc4JAuPM","name":"abseil-cpp-20220623.2.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1957614,"download_count":170,"created_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:56Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T19:56:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/download/20220623.2/abseil-cpp-20220623.2.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20220623.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20220623.2","body":"# Abseil LTS 20220623.2\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* Added [`absl::AnyInvocable`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/functional/any_invocable.h), a move-only function type.\r\n* Added [`absl::CordBuffer`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/cord_buffer.h), a type for buffering data for eventual inclusion an `absl::Cord`, which is useful for writing zero-copy code.\r\n* Added [support for command-line flags of type `absl::optional<T>`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/273292d1cfc0a94a65082ee350509af1d113344d/absl/flags/marshalling.h#L68-L102).\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* CMake builds now use the flag [`ABSL_BUILD_TESTING`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/fb7dd24b18e82893e5922be5d1c8ae0f3fe3c9fa) (default: `OFF`) to control whether or not unit tests are built.\r\n* The `ABSL_DEPRECATED` macro now works with the GCC compiler. GCC users that are experiencing new warnings can use `-Wno-deprecated-declatations` silence the warnings or use `-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations` to see warnings but not fail the build.\r\n* `ABSL_CONST_INIT` uses the C++20 keyword `constinit` when available. [Some compilers are more strict about where this keyword must appear compared to the pre-C++20 implementation.](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/273292d1cfc0a94a65082ee350509af1d113344d/absl/base/attributes.h#L679-L717)\r\n* Bazel builds now depend on the [bazelbuild/bazel-skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib) repository.

Note that this functionality requires C++17 or newer.\r\n* [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod) is now officially supported (previously it was supported by the community). Note that it may take several days after the release for it to become available in the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/abseil-cpp).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* `AbslHashValue()` [no longer accepts C-style arrays as a parameter](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/1415840502f38952e63c1c6e4892f6e69ce7bc13). Previously the array would decay to a pointer type, which could lead to subtle, unintended bugs. The most common potential error is passing a C-string literal. After this change, these call-sites require wrapping the literal in `absl::string_view`.\r\n* `absl::weak_equality` and `absl::strong_equality` have been removed. The corresponding `std` types were removed before C++20 was finalized (https://wg21.link/P1959R0).\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* None known at this time.\r\n\r\nBaseline: 10f3e6117b1154ca8e7e744809d82988f0ff481d\r\nCherry pick: 4a2c63365eff8823a5221db86ef490e828306f9d","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/138026484/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/121548745","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/121548745/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/121548745/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20230802.1","id":121548745,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4HPq_J","tag_name":"20230802.1","target_commitish":"lts_2023_08_02","name":"Abseil LTS branch, Aug 2023, Patch 1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-09-18T14:40:01Z","published_at":"2023-09-18T14:43:06Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20230802.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20230802.1","body":"# Abseil LTS 20230802.1\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* Added the [`nullability`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/nullability.h) library for designating the expected nullability of pointers.

The compatibility macro `ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS` can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete replacement for [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) yet. `VLOG` and `DFATAL` are examples of features that have not yet been released.\r\n\r\nBaseline: a69b0ae5cdba53a45617afc408618a3e1ac244de","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/90201153/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":12,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/75942916","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/75942916/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/75942916/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20220623.1","id":75942916,"author":{"login":"suertreus","id":13262534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjYyNTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13262534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus","html_url":"https://github.com/suertreus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suertreus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBjZydc4EhswE","tag_name":"20220623.1","target_commitish":"lts_2022_06_23","name":"Abseil LTS branch, June 2022, Patch 1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-08-31T17:15:21Z","published_at":"2022-08-31T17:29:09Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20220623.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20220623.1","body":"# Abseil LTS 20220623.1\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* Added [`absl::AnyInvocable`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/functional/any_invocable.h), a move-only function type.\r\n* Added [`absl::CordBuffer`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/cord_buffer.h), a type for buffering data for eventual inclusion an `absl::Cord`, which is useful for writing zero-copy code.\r\n* Added [support for command-line flags of type `absl::optional<T>`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/273292d1cfc0a94a65082ee350509af1d113344d/absl/flags/marshalling.h#L68-L102).\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* CMake builds now use the flag [`ABSL_BUILD_TESTING`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/fb7dd24b18e82893e5922be5d1c8ae0f3fe3c9fa) (default: `OFF`) to control whether or not unit tests are built.\r\n* The `ABSL_DEPRECATED` macro now works with the GCC compiler.

This target had no effect and references to this target in user code can safely be removed.\r\n\r\nBaseline: 997aaf3a28308eba1b9156aa35ab7bca9688e9f6"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/36616310","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/36616310/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/36616310/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20200923.3","id":36616310,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM2NjE2MzEw","tag_name":"20200923.3","target_commitish":"lts_2020_09_23","name":"Abseil LTS branch, Sept 2020, Patch 3","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-01-19T18:49:15Z","published_at":"2021-01-19T18:52:40Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20200923.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20200923.3","body":"# Abseil LTS 20200923, Patch 3\r\n\r\n## What's New:\r\n* `absl::StatusOr<T>` has been released.

Users\r\n  using a supported build system (Bazel or CMake) are unaffected by\r\n  this, but users manually specifying link libraries may get an error\r\n  about a missing linker input.\r\n\r\nBaseline: 7680a5f8efe32de4753baadbd63e74e59d95bac1\r\nCherry picks: None"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/25781460","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/25781460/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/25781460/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20200225.2","id":25781460,"author":{"login":"derekmauro","id":761129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmauro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmauro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI1NzgxNDYw","tag_name":"20200225.2","target_commitish":"lts_2020_02_25","name":"Abseil LTS branch, Feb 2020, Patch 2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-04-22T19:43:08Z","published_at":"2020-04-22T19:48:57Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20200225.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20200225.2","body":"This release fixes the list of dependencies of `absl::Cord` in the CMake build."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/24229259","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/24229259/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/24229259/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/releases/tag/20200225.1","id":24229259,"author":{"login":"zhangxy988","id":19511589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTExNTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19511589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxy988","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxy988/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI0MjI5MjU5","tag_name":"20200225.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Abseil LTS branch, Feb 2020, Patch 1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-03-04T20:57:37Z","published_at":"2020-03-04T22:08:21Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/tarball/20200225.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abseil/abseil-cpp/zipball/20200225.1","body":"Patched Feb 2020 LTS branch with the bug fix for `absl::Status::ErasePayload`."}]
