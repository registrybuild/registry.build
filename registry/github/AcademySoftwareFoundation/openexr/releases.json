release several significant changes:\r\n\r\n- The C++ API now uses the OpenEXRCore library underneath.\r\n\r\n  - This is a transparent change to the existing API, although the ABI (i.e. structure / class layout) has changed\r\n  - Existing reading of pixel data should be more efficient due to fewer memory allocations / frees during the process of reading. Additionally, some more specialisation of unpacking routines may result in faster unpack times\r\n  - All compression routines are implemented by the C Core layer underneath and no longer duplicated\r\n  - Initial support for \"stateless\" reading of scanlines has been proposed, allowing multiple threads to read scanlines into different frame buffer objects at the same time. While well tested at the Core level, the C++ api should be considered experimental for this release\r\n  - Thread dispatch for reading different file types has been made more homogeneous, so is simpler and more consistent\r\n\r\n- New API for accessing compression types\r\n\r\n  In anticipation of future support for new compression types, there is now a convenience API for mapping between compression type names and the associated enum:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  getCompressionDescriptionFromId(Compression, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionIdFromName(const std::string&, Compression&)\r\n  getCompressionNameFromId(Compression, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionNamesString(const std::string&, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionNumScanlines(Compression)\r\n  isValidCompression(int)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- New bin tools:\r\n\r\n  - exrmetrics - Read an OpenEXR image from infile, write an identical copy to outfile reporting time taken to read/write and file sizes. Useful for benchmarking performance in space and time.\r\n\r\n  - exrmanifest - Read exr files and print the contents of the embedded manifest. The manifest provides a mapping between integer object identifiers and human-readible strings. See [OpenEXR Deep IDs Specification](https://openexr.com/en/latest/DeepIDsSpecification.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n- New python bindings.\r\n\r\n  This version introduces a new python API, the File object, which provides full support for reading and writing all types of .exr image files, including scanline, tiled, deep, mult-part, multi-view, and multi-resolution images with pixel types of unsigned 32-bit integers and 16- and 32-bit floats.

release with several additions, changes and improvements:\r\n\r\n* Zip compression via ``libdeflate``\r\n\r\n  As of OpenEXR release v3.2, OpenEXR depends on [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) for DEFLATE-based compression. Previous OpenEXR releases relied on  [zlib](https://www.zlib.net). Builds of OpenEXR can choose either an  ``libdeflate`` installation, or CMake can auto-fetch the source and  build it internally. The internal build is linked statically, so no  extra shared object is produced.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) for more details.\r\n\r\n* New camdkit/camdkit-enabled standard attributes\r\n\r\n  These changes bring to OpenEXR new standard optional attributes that  were discussed in the [SMPTE Rapid Industry Solutions On-Set Virtual  Production Initiative)](https://www.smpte.org/blog/update-on-smptes-rapid-industry-solutions-ris-on-set-virtual-production-osvp-initiative). Additionally,  some useful attributes from the SMPTE ACES Container File Layout  standard, SMPTE ST 2065-4:2023, have been included as well. The new  attributes are:\r\n\r\n  Support automated editorial workflow:\r\n\r\n  - ``reelName``\r\n  - ``imageCounter``\r\n  - ``ascFramingDecisionList``\r\n\r\n  Support forensics:\r\n\r\n  - ``cameraMake``\r\n  - ``cameraModel``\r\n  - ``cameraSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``cameraFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraUuid``\r\n  - ``cameraLabel``\r\n  - ``lensMake``\r\n  - ``lensModel``\r\n  - ``lensSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``lensFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraColorBalance``\r\n\r\n  Support pickup shots:\r\n\r\n  - ``shutterAngle``\r\n  - ``cameraCCTSetting``\r\n  - ``cameraTintSetting``\r\n\r\n  Support metadata-driven match move:\r\n\r\n  - ``sensorCenterOffset``\r\n  - ``sensorOverallDimensions``\r\n  - ``sensorPhotositePitch``\r\n  - ``sensorAcquisitionRectangle``\r\n  - ``nominalFocalLength``\r\n  - ``effectiveFocalLength``\r\n  - ``pinholeFocalLength``\r\n  - ``entrancePupilOffset``\r\n  - ``tStop`` (complementing existing aperture)\r\n\r\n  Also, ``renderingTransform`` and ``lookTransform`` have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n  See [website/StandardAttributes.rst](website/StandardAttributes.rst)  and [PR  #1383](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1383) for more details.\r\n\r\n* Updated SO versioning policy \r\n\r\n  This change adopts a policy of appending the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``  software release name to the ``SONAME`` to form the real name of the  shared library.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) and [PR #1498](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1498)  for more details.\r\n\r\n* Python bindings & PyPI wheel\r\n\r\n  Support for the [OpenEXR python  bindings](https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR) have been formally adopted by the OpenEXR project.\r\n  \r\n* Miscellaneous improvements:\r\n\r\n  - \"docs\" renamed to \"website\" ([PR   #1504](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1504))\r\n\r\n  - Additional deep & multipart code examples ([PR  #1493](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1493)\r\n    and [PR   #1502](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1502))\r\n\r\n  - Many small build/test fixes\r\n  \r\n  - bin tools man pages\r\n\r\n  - Expanded test coverage\r\n\r\nSpecific OSS-fuzz issues addressed:\r\n\r\n* OSS-fuzz [46459](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46459) Out-of-memory in ``openexr_exrcheck_fuzzer`` \r\n* OSS-fuzz [46432](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46432)

release with significant new features:\r\n\r\nThe 3.1 release of OpenEXR introduces a new library, OpenEXRCore, which is the result of a significant re-thinking of how OpenEXR manages file I/O and provides access to image data. It begins to address long-standing scalability issues with multithreaded image reading and writing.\r\n\r\nThe OpenEXRCore library provides thread-safe, non-blocking access to files, which was not possible with the current API, where the framebuffer management is separate from read requests. It is written entirely in C and provides a new C-language API alongside the existing C++ API. This new low-level API allows applications to do custom unpacking of EXR data, such as on the GPU, while still benefiting from efficient I/O, file validation, and other semantics. It provides efficient direct access to EXR files in texturing applications. This C library also introduces an easier path to implementing OpenEXR bindings in other languages, such as Rust.\r\n\r\nThe 3.1 release represents a technology preview for upcoming releases. The initial release is incremental; the existing API and underlying behavior has not changed. The new API is available now for performance validation testing, and then in future OpenEXR releases, the C++ API will migrate to use the new core in stages.  It is not the intention to entirely deprecate the C++ API, nor must all applications re-implement EXR I/O in terms of the C library. The C API does not, and will not, provide the rich set of utility classes that exist in the C++ layer. The 3.1 release of the OpenEXRCore library simply offers new functionality for specialty applications seeking the highest possible performance. In the future, the ABI will evolve, but the API will remain consistent, or only have additions.\r\n\r\nSee the [release notes](CHANGES.md) and the [technical documentation](https://openexr.readthedocs.io) for more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/46574991/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/tag/v3.0.5","id":45509883,"author":{"login":"cary-ilm","id":21344665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzQ0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21344665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm","html_url":"https://github.com/cary-ilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1NTA5ODgz","tag_name":"v3.0.5","target_commitish":"RB-3.0","name":"v3.0.5","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-06-30T16:56:39Z","published_at":"2021-07-02T13:33:07Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/tarball/v3.0.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/zipball/v3.0.5","body":"Patch
