release with several additions, changes and improvements:\r\n\r\n* Zip compression via ``libdeflate``\r\n\r\n  As of OpenEXR release v3.2, OpenEXR depends on [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) for DEFLATE-based compression. Previous OpenEXR releases relied on  [zlib](https://www.zlib.net). Builds of OpenEXR can choose either an  ``libdeflate`` installation, or CMake can auto-fetch the source and  build it internally. The internal build is linked statically, so no  extra shared object is produced.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) for more details.\r\n\r\n* New camdkit/camdkit-enabled standard attributes\r\n\r\n  These changes bring to OpenEXR new standard optional attributes that  were discussed in the [SMPTE Rapid Industry Solutions On-Set Virtual  Production Initiative)](https://www.smpte.org/blog/update-on-smptes-rapid-industry-solutions-ris-on-set-virtual-production-osvp-initiative). Additionally,  some useful attributes from the SMPTE ACES Container File Layout  standard, SMPTE ST 2065-4:2023, have been included as well. The new  attributes are:\r\n\r\n  Support automated editorial workflow:\r\n\r\n  - ``reelName``\r\n  - ``imageCounter``\r\n  - ``ascFramingDecisionList``\r\n\r\n  Support forensics:\r\n\r\n  - ``cameraMake``\r\n  - ``cameraModel``\r\n  - ``cameraSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``cameraFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraUuid``\r\n  - ``cameraLabel``\r\n  - ``lensMake``\r\n  - ``lensModel``\r\n  - ``lensSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``lensFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraColorBalance``\r\n\r\n  Support pickup shots:\r\n\r\n  - ``shutterAngle``\r\n  - ``cameraCCTSetting``\r\n  - ``cameraTintSetting``\r\n\r\n  Support metadata-driven match move:\r\n\r\n  - ``sensorCenterOffset``\r\n  - ``sensorOverallDimensions``\r\n  - ``sensorPhotositePitch``\r\n  - ``sensorAcquisitionRectangle``\r\n  - ``nominalFocalLength``\r\n  - ``effectiveFocalLength``\r\n  - ``pinholeFocalLength``\r\n  - ``entrancePupilOffset``\r\n  - ``tStop`` (complementing existing aperture)\r\n\r\n  Also, ``renderingTransform`` and ``lookTransform`` have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n  See [website/StandardAttributes.rst](website/StandardAttributes.rst)  and [PR  #1383](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1383) for more details.\r\n\r\n* Updated SO versioning policy \r\n\r\n  This change adopts a policy of appending the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``  software release name to the ``SONAME`` to form the real name of the  shared library.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) and [PR #1498](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1498)  for more details.\r\n\r\n* Python bindings & PyPI wheel\r\n\r\n  Support for the [OpenEXR python  bindings](https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR) have been formally adopted by the OpenEXR project.\r\n  \r\n* Miscellaneous improvements:\r\n\r\n  - \"docs\" renamed to \"website\" ([PR   #1504](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1504))\r\n\r\n  - Additional deep & multipart code examples ([PR  #1493](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1493)\r\n    and [PR   #1502](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1502))\r\n\r\n  - Many small build/test fixes\r\n  \r\n  - bin tools man pages\r\n\r\n  - Expanded test coverage\r\n\r\nSpecific OSS-fuzz issues addressed:\r\n\r\n* OSS-fuzz [46459](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46459) Out-of-memory in ``openexr_exrcheck_fuzzer`` \r\n* OSS-fuzz [46432](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46432)

release with significant new features:\r\n\r\nThe 3.1 release of OpenEXR introduces a new library, OpenEXRCore, which is the result of a significant re-thinking of how OpenEXR manages file I/O and provides access to image data. It begins to address long-standing scalability issues with multithreaded image reading and writing.\r\n\r\nThe OpenEXRCore library provides thread-safe, non-blocking access to files, which was not possible with the current API, where the framebuffer management is separate from read requests. It is written entirely in C and provides a new C-language API alongside the existing C++ API. This new low-level API allows applications to do custom unpacking of EXR data, such as on the GPU, while still benefiting from efficient I/O, file validation, and other semantics. It provides efficient direct access to EXR files in texturing applications. This C library also introduces an easier path to implementing OpenEXR bindings in other languages, such as Rust.\r\n\r\nThe 3.1 release represents a technology preview for upcoming releases. The initial release is incremental; the existing API and underlying behavior has not changed. The new API is available now for performance validation testing, and then in future OpenEXR releases, the C++ API will migrate to use the new core in stages.  It is not the intention to entirely deprecate the C++ API, nor must all applications re-implement EXR I/O in terms of the C library. The C API does not, and will not, provide the rich set of utility classes that exist in the C++ layer. The 3.1 release of the OpenEXRCore library simply offers new functionality for specialty applications seeking the highest possible performance. In the future, the ABI will evolve, but the API will remain consistent, or only have additions.\r\n\r\nSee the [release notes](CHANGES.md) and the [technical documentation](https://openexr.readthedocs.io) for more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/46574991/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/45509883/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/tag/v3.0.5","id":45509883,"author":{"login":"cary-ilm","id":21344665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzQ0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21344665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm","html_url":"https://github.com/cary-ilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1NTA5ODgz","tag_name":"v3.0.5","target_commitish":"RB-3.0","name":"v3.0.5","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-06-30T16:56:39Z","published_at":"2021-07-02T13:33:07Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/tarball/v3.0.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/zipball/v3.0.5","body":"Patch

release with major build restructuring, security improvements, and new features:\r\n\r\nRestructuring:\r\n* The IlmBase/PyIlmBase submodules have been separated into the Imath project, now included by OpenEXR via a CMake submodule dependency, fetched automatically via CMake's FetchContent if necessary.\r\n* The library is now called ``libOpenEXR`` (instead of ``libIlmImf``). No header files have been renamed; they retain the ``Imf`` prefix.\r\n* Symbol linkage visibility is limited to specific public symbols. See [SymbolVisibility.md](docs/SymbolVisibility.md) for more details.\r\n\r\nBuild improvements:\r\n* No more simultaneous static/shared build option.\r\n* Community-provided support for bazel.\r\n* Gnu autoconf/bootstrap/configure build setup has been retired.\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n* ID Manifest Attributes, as described in [\"A Scheme for Storing Object ID Manifests in OpenEXR Images\"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3233085.3233086), Peter Hillman, DigiPro 18: Proceedings of the 8th Annual Digital Production Symposium, August 2018.\r\n* New program: exrcheck validates the contents of an EXR file.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* EXR files with no channels are no longer allowed.\r\n* Hard limit on the size of deep tile sizes; tiles must be less than 2<sup>30</sup> pixels.\r\n* Tiled DWAB files used STATIC_HUFFMAN compression.\r\n* ``Int64`` and ``SInt64`` types are deprecated in favor of ``uint64_t`` and ``int64_t``.\r\n* Header files have been pruned of extraneous #include's (\"Include What You Use\"), which may generate compiler errors in application source \r\n  code from undefined symbols or partially-defined types. These can be resolved by identifying and including the appropriate header.\r\n* See the porting guide for details about differences from previous releases and how to address them.\r\n* Also refer to the porting guide for details about changes to Imath.\r\n"}]
