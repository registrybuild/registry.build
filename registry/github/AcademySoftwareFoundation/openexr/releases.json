v3.4 introduces a new, additional compression option to the OpenEXR file format for **lossless compression with High Throughput JPEG-2000 (HTJ2K)** encoding:\r\n\r\n* A new HTJ2K compressor uses the **High-Throughput (HT) block  coder**. It supports the full range of OpenEXR features, including  16-bit and 32-bit floating-point image channels, both scanline and  tiled.\r\n\r\n* The HT block coder is standardized in [Rec. ITU-T T.814](https://loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000566.shtml)  and [ISO/IEC 15444-15](https://www.iso.org/standard/76621.html). It  is **royalty-free**, widely used in cinema and distribution servicing,  and implemented in both commercial and open-source toolkits.\r\n\r\n* In experiments, we've found that HTJ2K produces smaller files, and  depending on the nature of the image data, is one of the fastest  compression types available in OpenEXR.\r\n\r\n* Integration with OpenEXR uses the [OpenJPH](https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH) open-source  library. For ease in managing the dependency, the OpenEXR CMake  configuration supports **automatically fetching and building `OpenJPH`  internally**, or linking against an **external installation**.\r\n\r\n* OpenEXR supports two new compression types with distinct space/time  trade-offs:\r\n\r\n  - `htj2k256` -- encodes/decodes chunks of 256 scanlines, producing  slightly smaller file size than `htj2k32`.\r\n\r\n  - `htj2k32` -- encodes/decodes chunks of 32 scanlines, better suited to multi-threading, so it offers significantly faster encoding and decoding (4-6x in some cases) than `htj2k256`, with a slight  increase in file size.\r\n\r\n* All existing OpenEXR compression options remain unchanged. This new  feature simply extends the range of compression types available.\r\n\r\n* Software compiled with OpenEXR v3.4 will be able to read HTJ2K compressed OpenEXRs without any code changes. Software that writes files may automatically support the new type, but may need a small update to make the new type available as a user option.\r\n\r\n* :warning: This is a **backwards-compatible extension** to the OpenEXR file format. Files written with OpenEXR v3.4 will be readable by applications built against previous releases, _unless_ they use the new `htj2k32` or `htj2k256` compression options.\r\n\r\n* :warning: This feature was first introduced for evaluation in February, 2025 via the `htj2k-beta` branch with a single 256 scanlines/chunk compression option, with the 32-scanline option added more recently. Application software written during this evaluation period **will need to change `IMF_HTJ2K_COMPRESSION` to `IMF_HTJ2K256_COMPRESSION`**, although files written with the earlier evaluation version should still read properly.\r\n\r\n### Other New Features:\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: **New `colorInteropID` standard attribute**\r\n\r\n  - The ID string endorsed by the Color Interop Forum to communicate the color space of RGB images in an interoperable manner.\r\n\r\n  - The contents of the string is described in the specification [An ID for Color Interop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T94lYbis9uCskL_ZEMxGBF2JryLfZnjxlEoNgRHZzBE/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n  - Guidance to application developers is provided in [Identifying the Color Space of OpenEXR Files](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTH1bq2L67ifvdDf64Amhzg4AbkIM5LG6yPHrB96Vwo/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: **New `bytes` attribute type**\r\n\r\n  - Designed to hold an arbitrary binary blob of metadata.\r\n\r\n  - The OpenEXR library forces no interpretations of the attribute  contents; it is strictly application-dependent.\r\n\r\n  - The attribute also holds a `typeHint` string which applications can use to suggest the intended interpretation of the contents,\r\n    but it is strictly informational.\r\n\r\n* :wrench: **TBB as a global thread provider**\r\n\r\n  - A new cmake option `-DOPENEXR_USE_TBB=ON` switches the internals of the thread pool to use TBB by default.\r\n  - Building with this option adds a link dependency on the `OneAPI TBB` distribution.\r\n\r\n* :wrench: **Vendored `libdeflate`**\r\n\r\n  - OpenEXR v3.4 now ships with a bundled distribution of the `libdeflate` library, replacing the previous \"auto-fetch\"  mechanism.\r\n  - By default, building OpenEXR will use a system installation of  `libdeflate` as before, but if none is found, the build will use  the internal copy of `libdeflate`.\r\n  - Use `-DOPENEXR_USE_INTERNAL_DEFLATE=ON` to force the use of the  internal vendored version.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes:\r\n\r\n* :bug: Using openexr via cmake `add_subdirectory` now works properly.\r\n\r\n###

AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/zipball/v3.3.0","body":"Minor release several significant changes:\r\n\r\n- The C++ API now uses the OpenEXRCore library underneath.\r\n\r\n  - This is a transparent change to the existing API, although the ABI (i.e. structure / class layout) has changed\r\n  - Existing reading of pixel data should be more efficient due to fewer memory allocations / frees during the process of reading. Additionally, some more specialisation of unpacking routines may result in faster unpack times\r\n  - All compression routines are implemented by the C Core layer underneath and no longer duplicated\r\n  - Initial support for \"stateless\" reading of scanlines has been proposed, allowing multiple threads to read scanlines into different frame buffer objects at the same time. While well tested at the Core level, the C++ api should be considered experimental for this release\r\n  - Thread dispatch for reading different file types has been made more homogeneous, so is simpler and more consistent\r\n\r\n- New API for accessing compression types\r\n\r\n  In anticipation of future support for new compression types, there is now a convenience API for mapping between compression type names and the associated enum:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  getCompressionDescriptionFromId(Compression, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionIdFromName(const std::string&, Compression&)\r\n  getCompressionNameFromId(Compression, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionNamesString(const std::string&, std::string&)\r\n  getCompressionNumScanlines(Compression)\r\n  isValidCompression(int)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- New bin tools:\r\n\r\n  - exrmetrics - Read an OpenEXR image from infile, write an identical copy to outfile reporting time taken to read/write and file sizes. Useful for benchmarking performance in space and time.\r\n\r\n  - exrmanifest - Read exr files and print the contents of the embedded manifest. The manifest provides a mapping between integer object identifiers and human-readible strings. See [OpenEXR Deep IDs Specification](https://openexr.com/en/latest/DeepIDsSpecification.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n- New python bindings.\r\n\r\n  This version introduces a new python API, the File object, which provides full support for reading and writing all types of .exr image files, including scanline, tiled, deep, mult-part, multi-view, and multi-resolution images with pixel types of unsigned 32-bit integers and 16- and 32-bit floats.

release with several additions, changes and improvements:\r\n\r\n* Zip compression via ``libdeflate``\r\n\r\n  As of OpenEXR release v3.2, OpenEXR depends on [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) for DEFLATE-based compression. Previous OpenEXR releases relied on  [zlib](https://www.zlib.net). Builds of OpenEXR can choose either an  ``libdeflate`` installation, or CMake can auto-fetch the source and  build it internally. The internal build is linked statically, so no  extra shared object is produced.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) for more details.\r\n\r\n* New camdkit/camdkit-enabled standard attributes\r\n\r\n  These changes bring to OpenEXR new standard optional attributes that  were discussed in the [SMPTE Rapid Industry Solutions On-Set Virtual  Production Initiative)](https://www.smpte.org/blog/update-on-smptes-rapid-industry-solutions-ris-on-set-virtual-production-osvp-initiative). Additionally,  some useful attributes from the SMPTE ACES Container File Layout  standard, SMPTE ST 2065-4:2023, have been included as well. The new  attributes are:\r\n\r\n  Support automated editorial workflow:\r\n\r\n  - ``reelName``\r\n  - ``imageCounter``\r\n  - ``ascFramingDecisionList``\r\n\r\n  Support forensics:\r\n\r\n  - ``cameraMake``\r\n  - ``cameraModel``\r\n  - ``cameraSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``cameraFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraUuid``\r\n  - ``cameraLabel``\r\n  - ``lensMake``\r\n  - ``lensModel``\r\n  - ``lensSerialNumber``\r\n  - ``lensFirmware``\r\n  - ``cameraColorBalance``\r\n\r\n  Support pickup shots:\r\n\r\n  - ``shutterAngle``\r\n  - ``cameraCCTSetting``\r\n  - ``cameraTintSetting``\r\n\r\n  Support metadata-driven match move:\r\n\r\n  - ``sensorCenterOffset``\r\n  - ``sensorOverallDimensions``\r\n  - ``sensorPhotositePitch``\r\n  - ``sensorAcquisitionRectangle``\r\n  - ``nominalFocalLength``\r\n  - ``effectiveFocalLength``\r\n  - ``pinholeFocalLength``\r\n  - ``entrancePupilOffset``\r\n  - ``tStop`` (complementing existing aperture)\r\n\r\n  Also, ``renderingTransform`` and ``lookTransform`` have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n  See [website/StandardAttributes.rst](website/StandardAttributes.rst)  and [PR  #1383](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1383) for more details.\r\n\r\n* Updated SO versioning policy \r\n\r\n  This change adopts a policy of appending the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``  software release name to the ``SONAME`` to form the real name of the  shared library.\r\n\r\n  See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) and [PR #1498](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1498)  for more details.\r\n\r\n* Python bindings & PyPI wheel\r\n\r\n  Support for the [OpenEXR python  bindings](https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR) have been formally adopted by the OpenEXR project.\r\n  \r\n* Miscellaneous improvements:\r\n\r\n  - \"docs\" renamed to \"website\" ([PR   #1504](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1504))\r\n\r\n  - Additional deep & multipart code examples ([PR  #1493](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1493)\r\n    and [PR   #1502](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1502))\r\n\r\n  - Many small build/test fixes\r\n  \r\n  - bin tools man pages\r\n\r\n  - Expanded test coverage\r\n\r\nSpecific OSS-fuzz issues addressed:\r\n\r\n* OSS-fuzz [46459](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46459) Out-of-memory in ``openexr_exrcheck_fuzzer`` \r\n* OSS-fuzz [46432](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46432)
