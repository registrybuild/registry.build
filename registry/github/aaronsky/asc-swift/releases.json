big deal in this release is support for the newly revealed [Enterprise Program API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/enterpriseprogramapi) from Apple. Due to the size and scope of this release, I have decided to make this the first release with a non-zero major version, and commit to semver going forward. This will be in alpha for a little bit while I test all the new API, so please consider sharing your feedback!\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Generated API modules have been relocated in the build to depend on the `AppStoreConnect` target and are no longer exported. Additionally, the `_Specification` private module was renamed to `AppStoreAPI` and made public. You will likely need to add `import AppStoreAPI` to many locations where you also `import AppStoreConnect` in order to import both the client layer (`AppStoreConnect`) and the API layer (`AppStoreAPI`). You may also be able to replace some of those `AppStoreConnect` imports with `AppStoreAPI`.\r\n- The `AppStoreConnect` product in the `Package.swift` now refers to a grouping of the `AppStoreConnect` and `AppStoreAPI` targets. To use the Enterprise Program API, you can add a dependency on the product named `EnterpriseProgram`. Depending on both in a singular target is also supported.\r\n- The `Authenticator` protocol now exposes a `API` readonly property. The `API` type contains information used by the client layer to determine the hostname and token audience used to perform requests. For the best downstream experience, set a default for your users (the built-in `JWT` authenticator uses `.appStoreConnect` as its default API).\r\n- Alpha-casing of special-cases of `.iOS`, `.macOS`, etc. as well as `.minussomethingVar` in the `Sort` enums on Paths have been adjusted for improved readability. (#29)\r\n- Swift 5.9 is now the minimum required Swift tools version.\r\n- iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9 are now the minimum required versions when targeting these platforms. (#32)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n- App Store Connect API has been updated for [version 3.5](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store_connect_api_release_notes/app_store_connect_api_3_5_release_notes) (#17)\r\n- Enterprise Program API support has been introduced to the library at [version 1.0](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/enterpriseprogramapi/enterprise-api-1-0-release-notes) (#22)\r\n- Bazel support has been added to the build, and asc-swift is available on the Bazel Central Registry (#27)\r\n\r\n## The Rest\r\n\r\n- Various fixes to prepare for compatibility with the Swift 6 language mode (#26)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**:
