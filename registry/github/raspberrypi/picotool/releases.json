to coincide with SDK 2.2.0. Includes minor improvements and bug fixes\r\n\r\nHighlights are listed below, or you can see the full list of individual commits

[here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+is%3Aclosed).\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* Added support for creating self-decrypting binaries to `picotool encrypt`\r\n* Added support to `picotool otp dump` to dump to a BIN file, and also to dump from a JSON file - this allows conversion from an OTP JSON file to a BIN file with `picotool otp dump otp.json --output otp.bin`\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* `picotool encrypt` now requires an IV Salt file to be passed in addition to the AES Key file\r\n\r\n### Notable Improvements\r\n\r\n* Sped up the `picotool info` command further for unhashed/unsigned binaries\r\n* Sped up `picotool save`, `picotool verify` and `picotool load`\r\n* `README.md` has been rearranged with a separate `BUILDING.md` file\r\n* `picotool` now plugs alignment holes in signed/encrypted binaries, to prevent failures when performing signature checks/decryption on uninitialised memory\r\n\r\n###
