Potential breaking changes\r\n\r\n* `scanner-common::capture_token` was renamed to `scanner-common::capture`, and old `scanner-common::capture` removed.\r\n  Previously, `capture_token` was a linker error anyway, but if you're calling `scanner-common::capture` it will no longer work for arbitrary rules and instead only like `dsl::capture`.\r\n* `lexy::parse_as_tree` will add a position token to production nodes that would otherwise be empty.\r\n  That way, no production node will be empty, unless the builder API is used directly.\r\n* Change `lexy::dsl::try_()` error recovery behavior:\r\n  It will now skip whitespace after the (optional) error recovery rule.\r\n* Deprecate the `lexy::parse_tree::builder::finish()` overload that does not take a `remaining_input`.\r\n* The typo `lexy::code_point::spaing_mark` was fixed to `spacing_mark`.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* **Experimental**: Add `lexy::parse_tree_input` and `lexy::dsl::tnode`/`lexy::dsl::pnode` to support multi-pass parsing.\r\n* Add `lexy::dsl::byte.if_`/`set`/`range`/`ascii` methods to match specific bytes.\r\n* Add an overload of `fatal_error()` on scanners that allows construction of type-erased generic errors (#134).\r\n* Add `lexy::buffer::release()` and `lexy::buffer::adopt()` to deconstruct a buffer into its components and re-assemble it later.\r\n* Add `lexy::parse_tree::node::position()` and `::covering_lexeme()`.\r\n* Add default argument to `lexy::dsl::flag()`.\r\n* Add `lexy::callback_with_state`.\r\n* Pass the parse state to the tag of `lexy::dsl::op` if required (#172) and to `lexy::dsl::error` (#211).\r\n* Enable CMake install rule for subdirectory builds (#205).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Add missing `constexpr` to container callbacks and `lexy::as_string`.\r\n* Fix infinite loop in `dsl::delimited` when dealing with invalid code points (#173).\r\n* Fix swallowed errors from case-folding rules (#149).\r\n* Fix `lexy::production_name` for productions in an anonymous namespace.\r\n* Fix bugs in `dsl::scan` (#133, #135, #142, #154, #209).\r\n* Fix bug with the position passed to the tag constructor of `lexy::dsl::op` (#170).\r\n* Fix bug where `lexy_ext::report_error` unconditionally wrote to `stderr`, ignoring the output iterator.\r\n* Fix bug with missing `lexy::error_context::position` in `lexy::parse_as_tree` (#184).\r\n* Fix `static_assert` in `lexy::parse_tree` (#190).\r\n* Fix bugs in `lexy::input_location::operator<` (#228).\r\n* Fix bugs in examples (#183)\r\n* Add missing `&&` in `lexy::bind_sink` (#221).\r\n* Workaround compiler bugs and improve documentation (#128, #129, #146, #181, #197, #216, #227).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @jgopel made their first contribution

Unicode 15 support, ability to split a grammar into multiple translation units using [`lexy::dsl::subgrammar`](https://lexy.foonathan.net/reference/dsl/subgrammar/#rule), and [significant performance improvements](https://lexy.foonathan.net/benchmark_json/).\r\n\r\n## Potential breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Change [`lexy::dsl::peek_not()` error recovery behavior:\r\n  it will now consume the input it matched to recover, which is more useful.\r\n* Remove `Production` parameter from `lexy::error_context`.\r\n  It is replaced by a type-erased `lexy::production_info`.\r\n* `lexy::validate`, `lexy::parse`, and `lexy::parse_as_tree` now type-erase generic error tags prior to invoking the callback.\r\n* Use type-erased `lexy::production_info` instead of `Production` type in `lexy::parse_tree`.\r\n  This is technically a breaking change, as it may affect overload resolution.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Update Unicode database to Unicode 15.\r\n* Use SWAR (SIMD within a register) techniques to optimize token parsing.\r\n* Add `lexy::dsl::subgrammar` to split a grammar into multiple translation units.\r\n* Add `lexy::dsl::flags` and `lexy::dsl::flag` to parse enum flags.\r\n* Add overload of `lexy::dsl::position` that parses a rule.\r\n  This allows using it as branch conditions.\r\n* Add `lexy::dsl::effect` to trigger side-effects during parsing.\r\n* Add `lexy::subexpression_production` to parse a subexpression.\r\n* Add `lexy::utf8_char_encoding`.\r\n* Add `lexy::parse_tree::remaining_input()` and populate it by `lexy::parse_as_tree`.\r\n* Add `lexy::make_buffer_from_input` function.\r\n* Add type-erased version of `lexy::error`.\r\n* Support non-`const` parse state.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix bug where `lexy::bind` callback does not forward rvalue arguments; they got turned into lvalues instead.\r\n* Fix bug where callback composition was not allowed if the final callback returns `void`.\r\n* Fix bug where `dsl::quoted(cc.error<foo>)` did not use `foo` as the error.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Xottab-DUTY made their first contribution in https://github.com/foonathan/lexy/pull/92\r\n\r\n**Full
