1.12.0 enables custom index size and type, from `int16_t` to `uint64_t`, allowing\r\nusers to have as small or large clouds as they wish. 1.12 also comes with improved\r\nsupport for VTK, Qhull, and CUDA, along with making existing functionality more user friendly.\r\n\r\nThis is all on top of the usual bug-fixes and performance improvements across the board.\r\n\r\nVTK warnings that might appear are due to internal deprecations, but users should check issue #4830 for more details regarding future proofing their code.\r\n\r\nFor an exhaustive list of newly added features, deprecations and

now defaults to the C++14 standard. Most of the Boost classes that we use were replaced with alternatives from the standard library. One notable exception are smart pointers. PCL still makes extensive use of `boost::shared_ptr`. However, several layers of abstraction  have been added to prepare for a smooth switch to `std::shared_ptr` in the next release:\r\n  * Added `pcl::make_shared` and `Class::Ptr`/`Class::ConstPtr` type-aliases. Use these instead of  direct names like `{boost, std}::shared_ptr` or `{boost, std}::make_shared` with PCL types.\r\n  * Added `pcl::shared_ptr` that offers the same abstraction for non-PCL types.\r\n\r\nPlease use the above-mentioned functions/aliases in downstream projects to ensure source code level compatibility with PCL 1.10 and future PCL releases.\r\n\r\nSee
