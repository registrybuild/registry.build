of let me say that everyone who still uses 2.0.x should strongly consider switching to 2.1.x releases, since 2.0.x will not contain *all* the bug fixes, because it can be pretty hard to backport them (for example 2.0.x does not support openssl 1.1)\r\n\r\nSecondly, this release is *beta*, because since the last release it has been along time, so we need sometime to stabilize things a little, and if none of you will find something odd the it will be marked as 2.0.24-stable.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all who reported, fixed and helped with debugging issues and backporting patches!\r\n\r\nFew words about release:\r\n- 2.0 backport branch (patches-2.0) had been added to the [travis-ci for continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/libevent/libevent/builds/482137311) (c52cdc28)\r\n- fix overflow check in expand_singlechain() (backport for #340) (7dedc07)\r\n- ipv6 fix for http (502c043)\r\n- Check for Mac OS X 10.4 kqueue bug properly (6762a4d6)\r\n- bufferevent_socket_connect{,_hostname}() fixes (ebcf2fed)\r\n- Use the free-trailing-chains function in evbuffer_insert_chain too (0e894fb)\r\n- evbuffer_add: Use last_with_datap if set, not last. (b00db82)\r\n- fixes for EV_ET (e12762a5, 11732245)\r\n- Merge branch 'evbuffer_add_file-2.0-fixes' into patches-2.0 (90ae4c50)\r\n- If evsel->del() fails, don't leave the evmap in an inconsistent state. (cb81be2b)\r\n- Backport for #340 (fix overflow check in expand_singlechain() (7dedc077)\r\n- Use the free-trailing-chains function in evbuffer_insert_chain too (0e894fb7)\r\n\r\nFor more information
