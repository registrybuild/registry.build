⚠️ API breaks:\r\n\r\n- `decode_jwt` now requires a template argument for traits\r\n- `builder` now requires a template argument for traits\r\n- `builder.set_audience()` takes `array_type` (previously was a set)\r\n   - replace `std::vector<std::string>{\"*\"}` with `std::vector<picojson::value>{ picojson::value(\"*\") }`\r\n\r\n### Generic `basic_claim`\r\n\r\nDepending on your application needs you might choose one JSON library over another, there's a lot of great choices.\r\n\r\nTo freely choose whichever is best for your application define your own traits.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\njwt::basic_claim<my_favorite_json_library_traits> claim(json::object({{\"json\", true},{\"example\", 0}}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you implement traits support for a library, please 🙏 submit a pull request to let us know!\r\n\r\n### EdDSA Support\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @Sp3EdeR for their great work 🏆 \r\n\r\nWith the additional algorithms, you can use the `jwt::create()` and `jwt::verify()` for handling your tokens\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto token = jwt::create().set_issuer(\"auth0\").set_type(\"JWS\").sign(\r\n    jwt::algorithm::ed25519(\"\", ed25519_priv_key, \"\", \"\")); // New algorithms have been added\r\n// ...\r\nauto decoded = jwt::decode(token);\r\njwt::verify().allow_algorithm(\r\n    jwt::algorithm::ed25519(ed25519_pub_key, \"\", \"\", \"\")) // New algorithms have been added\r\n   .verify(decoded);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Base64 DER encoded to PEM helper\r\n\r\nRound of applause for @jbajwa for bringing more JOSE support to the library\r\n\r\nWhen working with OAuth2 and OpenID, it's very common to obtain the public key for verifying tokens from JWK.\r\nIf the public key is exposed with the `\"x5c\"` you can use a helper to convert it to PEM which is consumed by the `jwt::verifier`\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto public_cert = jwt::helper::convert_base64_der_to_pem(x5c_base64_der, ec);\r\nauto verify = jwt::verify().allow_algorithm(jwt::algorithm::rs256(public_cert, \"\", \"\", \"\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### LibreSSL Support\r\n\r\nAlong with other freedom for JSON libraries there may be a motivating factor for your _crypto_ needs, there for we have expanded support to include LibreSSL.\r\n\r\nThis can be configured through CMake\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncmake .. -DJWT_SSL_LIBRARY:STRING=\"LibreSSL\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the header only approach, make sure to define `LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER` before including `jwt.h`\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <tls.h>\r\n#include \"jwt-cpp/jwt.h\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n> 📓 If you have both OpenSSL and LibreSSL installed, they may be in conflict which can produce compile or runtime errors\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNumerous
