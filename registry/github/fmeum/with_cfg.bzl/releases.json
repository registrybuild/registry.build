This means that hardcoded runfiles paths need to be updated, e.g. from `my_repo/some/pkg/bin.exe` to `my_repo/some/pkg/bin/bin.exe`. This change is necessary to fix issues with shared library dependencies (see https://github.com/fmeum/with_cfg.bzl/issues/85). You can opt out of this change temporarily via `--no@with_cfg.bzl//:incompatible_same_depth_path_layout`.
