release fixes a rare but critical bug which only occurs when a very long collision chain (> 32 767) occurs due to a poor hash function, see first bullet point. Upgrade is recommended. \r\n\r\n* Keep rehashing if `dist_from_ideal_bucket` is > `DIST_FROM_IDEAL_BUCKET_LIMIT` during insertion (fix issue #52)\r\n    * During insertion a check was done on `dist_from_ideal_bucket` to be sure it doesn't becomes bigger than `DIST_FROM_IDEAL_BUCKET_LIMIT` but this was only done during the robin swap. A check should also be done beforehand if we find an empty bucket otherwise the variable could overflow and lead to bugs. This commit adds this check.\r\n    * The bug should only manifest itself if the collision chain becomes larger than 32 767 due to a very poor hash function.\r\n* Disable CMake install rule if robin_map is used as subproject (#60) \r\n* Replace deprecated `std::aligned_storage` since C++23 by `alignas` (#61) \r\n* Raise `DIST_FROM_IDEAL_BUCKET_LIMIT` to 8192\r\n* Clear and shrink the moved hash table in the move operator to be coherent with the move constructor\r\n* When using C++17, `std::launder` the reinterpreted pointer from `std::aligned_storage` to adapt to the change of object model introduced in P0137R1. Fix potential but very [unlikely](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/g/std-discussion/c/xaAwFR6qUmY) undefined behaviour.\r\n    * C++17 introduced a change in the object model with P0137R1 which now requires the reinterpreted pointer from `std::aligned_storage` to be laundered.

The `distance_type` used to store the distance of a value in a bucket from its ideal bucket could overflow when a lot of collisions happened and the `load_factor()` stayed below `REHASH_ON_HIGH_NB_PROBES__MIN_LOAD_FACTOR`. We now rehash no matter the load factor if the distance becomes too high.\r\n* Add `bool contains(...)` methods.
