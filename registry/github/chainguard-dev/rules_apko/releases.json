Add to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n\n```starlark\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_apko\", version = \"1.1.0\")\n```\n\n## Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste this snippet into your  file:\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"rules_apko\",\n    sha256 = \"95152b4eee2339cc1bf89f4a35fad9cd286f91ea18e4b8800b03fca726f9eb57\",\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_apko-1.1.0\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/releases/download/v1.1.0/rules_apko-v1.1.0.tar.gz\",\n)\n\n######################\n# rules_apko setup #\n######################\n# Fetches the rules_apko dependencies.\n# If you want to have a different version of some dependency,\n# you should fetch it *before* calling this.\n# Alternatively, you can skip calling this function, so long as you've\n# already fetched all the dependencies.\nload(\"@rules_apko//apko:repositories.bzl\", \"apko_register_toolchains\", \"rules_apko_dependencies\")\n\nrules_apko_dependencies()\n\napko_register_toolchains(name = \"apko\")\n\nload(\"@rules_apko//apko:translate_lock.bzl\", \"translate_apko_lock\")\n\ntranslate_apko_lock(\n    name = \"example_lock\",\n    lock = \"@//:apko.resolved.json\",\n)\n\nload(\"@example_lock//:repositories.bzl\", \"apko_repositories\")\n\napko_repositories()\n```\n\n## Initial setup\n\nrules_apko requires a one-time setup to configure bazel to be able to make partial fetches.\n\nFollow https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/blob/main/docs/initial-setup.md for the setup.\n\n"}]
