This includes a security fix for CVE-2025-31115 which affects XZ Utils from 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0. See the [security advisory](https://tukaani.org/xz/threaded-decoder-early-free.html) for details.\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.8.1 (2025-04-03)\r\n\r\n    * Multithreaded .xz decoder (lzma_stream_decoder_mt()):\r\n\r\n        - Fix a bug that could at least result in a crash with\r\n          invalid input. (CVE-2025-31115)\r\n\r\n        - Fix a performance bug: Only one thread was used if the whole\r\n          input file was provided at once to lzma_code(), the output\r\n          buffer was big enough, timeout was disabled, and LZMA_FINISH\r\n          was used. There are no bug reports about this, thus it's\r\n          possible that no real-world application was affected.\r\n\r\n    * Avoid <stdalign.h> even with C11/C17 compilers. This fixes the\r\n      build with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6 on Solaris 10 when the\r\n      compiler is in C11 mode (the header doesn't exist).\r\n\r\n    * Autotools: Restore compatibility with GNU make versions older\r\n      than 4.0 by creating the package using GNU gettext 0.23.1\r\n      infrastructure instead of 0.24.\r\n\r\n    * Update Croatian

(2025-03-25)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.6.x, 5.4.x, 5.2.x, and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma on 32/64-bit x86: When possible, use SSE2 intrinsics\r\n      instead of memcpy() in the LZMA/LZMA2 decoder. In typical cases,\r\n      this may reduce decompression time by 0-5 %. However, when built\r\n      against musl libc, over 15 % time reduction was observed with\r\n      highly compressed files.\r\n\r\n    * CMake: Make the feature test macros match the Autotools-based\r\n      build on NetBSD, Darwin, and mingw-w64.\r\n\r\n    * Update the Croatian, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian\r\n      translations.\r\n\r\n    * Update the German, Italian, Korean, Romanian, Serbian, and\r\n      Ukrainian man page translations.\r\n\r\n    Summary of changes in the 5.7.x development releases:\r\n\r\n    * Mark the following LZMA Utils script aliases as deprecated:\r\n      lzcmp, lzdiff, lzless, lzmore, lzgrep, lzegrep, and lzfgrep.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Improve LZMA/LZMA2 encoder speed on 64-bit PowerPC (both\r\n          endiannesses) and those 64-bit RISC-V processors that\r\n          support fast unaligned access.\r\n\r\n        - Add low-level APIs for RISC-V, ARM64, and x86 BCJ filters\r\n          to lzma/bcj.h. These are primarily for erofs-utils.\r\n\r\n        - x86/x86-64/E2K CLMUL CRC code was rewritten.\r\n\r\n        - Use the CRC32 instructions on LoongArch.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Synchronize the output file and its directory using fsync()\r\n          before deleting the input file. No syncing is done when xz\r\n          isn't going to delete the input file.\r\n\r\n        - Add --no-sync to disable the sync-before-delete behavior.\r\n\r\n        - Make --single-stream imply --keep.\r\n\r\n    * xz, xzdec, lzmainfo: When printing messages, replace\r\n      non-printable characters with question marks.\r\n\r\n    * xz and xzdec on Linux: Support Landlock ABI versions 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n    * CMake: Revise the configuration variables and some of their\r\n      options, and document them in the file INSTALL.

```\r\n5.7.1alpha (2025-01-23)\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.6.4.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Improve LZMA/LZMA2 encoder speed on 64-bit PowerPC (both\r\n          endiannesses) and those 64-bit RISC-V processors that\r\n          support fast unaligned access.\r\n\r\n        - x86/x86-64/E2K CLMUL CRC code was rewritten. It's faster and\r\n          doesn't cause false positives from sanitizers. Attributes\r\n          like __attribute__((__no_sanitize_address__)) are no longer\r\n          present.\r\n\r\n        - On 32-bit x86, CLMUL CRC and the old (but still good)\r\n          assembly versions now co-exist with runtime detection.\r\n          Both Autotools and CMake build systems handle this\r\n          automatically now.\r\n\r\n        - Use the CRC32 instructions on LoongArch to make CRC32\r\n          calculation faster.\r\n\r\n        - Add low-level APIs for RISC-V, ARM64, and x86 BCJ filters\r\n          to lzma/bcj.h. These are primarily for erofs-utils.\r\n\r\n        - Minor tweaks to ARM64 CRC32 code and BCJ filters were made.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Synchronize the output file and its directory before deleting\r\n          the input file using fsync(). This reduces the probability of\r\n          data loss after a system crash. However, it can be a major\r\n          performance hit if processing many small files.\r\n\r\n          NOTE: No syncing is done when xz isn't going to delete\r\n          the input file.\r\n\r\n        - Add a new option --no-sync to disable the sync-before-delete\r\n          behavior. It's useful when compressing many small files and\r\n          one doesn't worry about data loss in case of a system crash.\r\n\r\n        - Make --single-stream imply --keep.\r\n\r\n        - Use automatic word wrapping for the text in --help and\r\n          similar situations to hopefully make the strings easier for\r\n          majority of translators (no need to count spaces anymore).\r\n\r\n    * xz, xzdec, lzmainfo: When printing messages, replace\r\n      non-printable characters with question marks. This way\r\n      malicious filenames cannot be used to send escape sequences\r\n      to a terminal. This change is also applied to filenames shown\r\n      in \"xz --robot --list\".\r\n\r\n    * xz and xzdec on Linux: Add support for Landlock ABI versions 5\r\n      and 6.\r\n\r\n    * CMake updates:\r\n\r\n        - Increase the minimum required CMake version to 3.20.\r\n\r\n        - Revise the configuration variables and some of their options.\r\n          Document them in the file INSTALL.\r\n\r\n        - Attempt to produce liblzma.pc so that the paths are based on\r\n          ${prefix}, which makes it simpler to override the paths\r\n          if the liblzma files have been moved.\r\n\r\n        - To enable translations, gettext-tools is now required. The\r\n          CMake build no longer supports installing pre-compiled\r\n          message catalog binary files (po/*.gmo).\r\n\r\n        - Apple: Use Mach-O shared library versioning that is\r\n          compatible with GNU Libtool. This should make it easier to\r\n          switch between the build systems on Apple OSes that enforce\r\n          the correct compatibility_version (macOS >= 12 doesn't?).\r\n          This change is backward compatible: binaries linked against\r\n          old CMake-built liblzma will run with liblzma that uses\r\n          Libtool style versioning.\r\n\r\n        - Windows (not Cygwin): Document CMAKE_DLL_NAME_WITH_SOVERSION\r\n          (CMake >= 3.27) in the file INSTALL. This option should\r\n          usually be left to its default value (OFF). It can be set\r\n          to ON if the liblzma DLL filename must be compatible with\r\n          the versioned filename produced by GNU Libtool. For example,\r\n          binaries distributed in MSYS2 use a versioned DLL filename.\r\n\r\n        - CMake support is no longer experimental. (It was already\r\n          not experimental when building for native Windows.)\r\n\r\n    * Windows: Building liblzma with Visual Studio 2013 is no longer\r\n      supported. Visual Studio 2015 or later (with CMake) can be used\r\n      to build liblzma and the command line tools.\r\n\r\n    * Add preliminary Georgian translation. This already contains\r\n      translations of most of the strings that are now automatically\r\n      word wrapped.\r\n\r\n    * Add build-aux/license-check.sh. Without arguments, it checks that\r\n      no license information has been forgotten. With the -v argument,\r\n      it shows the license info (or the lack of it) for each file.\r\n\r\n      If the .git directory is available, only the files in the\r\n      repository are checked. Without the .git directory, a clean tree\r\n      from an extracted release tarball is expected.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/196486145/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/196485281","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/196485281/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/196485281/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.6.4","id":196485281,"author":{"login":"Larhzu","id":120408189,"node_id":"U_kgDOBy1IfQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120408189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu","html_url":"https://github.com/Larhzu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4LtiCh","tag_name":"v5.6.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

(2025-01-23)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma: Fix LZMA/LZMA2 encoder on big endian ARM64.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix --filters= and --filters1= ... --filters9= options\r\n          parsing. They require an argument, thus \"xz --filters lzma2\"\r\n          should work in addition to \"xz --filters=lzma2\".\r\n\r\n        - On the man page, note in the --compress and --decompress\r\n          options that the default behavior is to delete the input\r\n          file unless writing to standard output. It was already\r\n          documented in the DESCRIPTION section but new users in\r\n          a hurry might miss it.\r\n\r\n    * Windows (native builds, not Cygwin): Fix regressions introduced\r\n      in XZ Utils 5.6.3 which caused non-ASCII characters to display\r\n      incorrectly. Only builds with translation support were affected\r\n      (--enable-nls or ENABLE_NLS=ON). The following changes affect\r\n      builds that have translations enabled:\r\n\r\n        - Require UCRT because MSVCRT doesn't support UTF-8\r\n          locales and thus translations won't be readable on\r\n          Windows 10 version 1903 and later. (MSVCRT builds\r\n          are still possible with --disable-nls or ENABLE_NLS=OFF.)\r\n\r\n        - Require gettext-runtime >= 0.23.1 because older versions\r\n          don't autodetect the use of the UTF-8 code page. This\r\n          resulted in garbled non-ASCII characters even with UCRT.\r\n\r\n        - Partially fix alignment issues in xz --verbose --list\r\n          with translated messages. Chinese (simplified),\r\n          Chinese (traditional), and Korean column headings\r\n          are misaligned still because Windows and MinGW-w64\r\n          don't provide wcwidth() and XZ Utils doesn't include\r\n          a replacement function either.\r\n\r\n    * CMake: Explicitly disable unity builds. This prevents build\r\n      failures when another project uses XZ Utils via CMake's\r\n      FetchContent module, and that project enables unity builds.\r\n\r\n    * Update Chinese (traditional) and Serbian translations.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/196485281/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/177855739","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/177855739/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/177855739/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.6.3","id":177855739,"author":{"login":"Larhzu","id":120408189,"node_id":"U_kgDOBy1IfQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120408189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu","html_url":"https://github.com/Larhzu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larhzu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4Kmdz7","tag_name":"v5.6.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

(2024-10-01)\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT: This includes a Windows-specific security fix to\r\n    the command line tools. liblzma isn't affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Fix x86-64 inline assembly compatibility with GNU Binutils\r\n          older than 2.27.\r\n\r\n        - Fix the build with GCC 4.2 on OpenBSD/sparc64.\r\n\r\n    * xzdec: Display an error instead of failing silently if the\r\n      unsupported option -M is specified.\r\n\r\n    * lzmainfo: Fix integer overflows when rounding the dictionary and\r\n      uncompressed sizes to the nearest mebibyte.\r\n\r\n    * Windows (except Cygwin and MSYS2): Add an application manifest to\r\n      xz, xzdec, lzmadec, and lzmainfo executables:\r\n\r\n        - Declare them compatible with Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11. This way\r\n          the programs won't needlessly use Operating System Context\r\n          of Vista when running on later Windows versions. This setting\r\n          doesn't mean that the executables cannot run on even older\r\n          versions if otherwise built that way.\r\n\r\n        - Declare them as UAC-compliant. MSVC added this by default\r\n          already but it wasn't done with MinGW-w64, at least not\r\n          with all toolchain variants.\r\n\r\n        - Declare them long path aware. This makes long path names\r\n          work on Windows 10 and 11 if the feature has been enabled\r\n          in the Windows registry.\r\n\r\n        - Use the UTF-8 code page on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.\r\n\r\n            * Now command line tools can access files whose names\r\n              contain characters that don't exist in the current\r\n              legacy code page.\r\n\r\n            * The options --files and --files0 now expect file lists\r\n              to be in UTF-8 instead of the legacy code page.\r\n\r\n            * This fixes a security issue: If a command line contains\r\n              Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that don't\r\n              exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are\r\n              converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit\r\n              mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII\r\n              characters that change the meaning of the command line,\r\n              which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do\r\n              argument injection or directory traversal attacks.\r\n              UTF-8 avoids best-fit mappings and thus fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n              Forcing the process code page to UTF-8 is possible only\r\n              on Windows 10 version 1903 and later. The command line\r\n              tools remain vulnerable if used on an old older\r\n              version of Windows.\r\n\r\n              This issue was discovered by Orange Tsai and splitline\r\n              from DEVCORE Research Team.\r\n\r\n              A related smaller issue remains: Windows filenames may\r\n              contain unpaired surrogates (invalid UTF-16). These are\r\n              converted to the replacement character U+FFFD in the\r\n              UTF-8 code page. Thus, filenames with different unpaired\r\n              surrogates appear identical and aren't distinguishable\r\n              from filenames that contain the actual replacement\r\n              character U+FFFD.\r\n\r\n            * When building with MinGW-w64, it is recommended to use\r\n              UCRT version instead of the old MSVCRT. For example,\r\n              non-ASCII characters from filenames won't print\r\n              correctly in messages to console with MSVCRT with\r\n              the UTF-8 code page (a cosmetic issue). liblzma-only\r\n              builds are still fine with MSVCRT.\r\n\r\n        - Cygwin and MSYS2 process command line options differently and\r\n          the above issues don't exist. There is no need to replace the\r\n          default application manifest on Cygwin and MSYS2.\r\n\r\n    * Autotools-based build:\r\n\r\n        - Fix feature checks with link-time optimization (-flto).\r\n\r\n        - Solaris: Fix a compatibility issue in version.sh. It matters\r\n          if one wants to regenerate configure by running autoconf.\r\n\r\n    * CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Use paths relative to ${prefix} in liblzma.pc when possible.\r\n          This is done only with CMake >= 3.20.\r\n\r\n        - MSVC: Install liblzma.pc as it can be useful with MSVC too.\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Fix liblzma filename prefix, for example:\r\n\r\n            * Cygwin: The DLL was incorrectly named liblzma-5.dll.\r\n              Now it is cyglzma-5.dll.\r\n\r\n            * MSVC: Rename import library from liblzma.lib to lzma.lib\r\n              while keeping liblzma.dll name as is. This helps with\r\n              \"pkgconf --msvc-syntax --libs liblzma\" because it mungles\r\n              \"-llzma\" in liblzma.pc to \"lzma.lib\".\r\n\r\n            * MinGW-w64: No changes.\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Use the correct resource file for lzmadec.exe.\r\n          Previously the resource file for xzdec.exe was used for both.\r\n          Autotools-based build isn't affected.\r\n\r\n        - Prefer a C11 compiler over a C99 compiler but accept both.\r\n\r\n        - Link Threads::Threads against liblzma using PRIVATE so that\r\n          -pthread and such flags won't unnecessarily get included in\r\n          the usage requirements of shared liblzma. That is,\r\n          target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE liblzma::liblzma) no\r\n          longer adds -pthread if using POSIX threads and linking\r\n          against shared liblzma. The threading flags are still added\r\n          if linking against static liblzma.\r\n\r\n    * Updated translations: Catalan, Chinese (simplified), and\r\n      Brazilian

5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2 have a build system issue that prevents building of shared libraries on some systems like mips64. See the patch itself for details. The same patch applies to 5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2.\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.6.2 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * Remove the backdoor (CVE-2024-3094).\r\n\r\n    * Not changed: Memory sanitizer (MSAN) has a false positive\r\n      in the CRC CLMUL code which also makes OSS Fuzz unhappy.\r\n      Valgrind is smarter and doesn't complain.\r\n\r\n      A revision to the CLMUL code is coming anyway and this issue\r\n      will be cleaned up as part of it. It won't be backported to\r\n      5.6.x or 5.4.x because the old code isn't wrong. There is\r\n      no reason to risk introducing regressions in old branches\r\n      just to silence a false positive.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_str_to_filters(): Fix a missing output pointer\r\n          initialization (*error_pos = 0). This is very similar\r\n          to the fix above.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n\r\n        - Remove GNU indirect function (IFUNC) support. This is *NOT*\r\n          done for security reasons even though the backdoor relied on\r\n          this code. The performance benefits of IFUNC are too tiny in\r\n          this project to make the extra complexity worth it.\r\n\r\n        - FreeBSD on ARM64: Add error checking to CRC32 instruction\r\n          support detection.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n    * xzdec: Add support for Linux Landlock ABI version 4. xz already\r\n      had the v3-to-v4 change but it had been forgotten from xzdec.\r\n\r\n    * Autotools-based build system (configure):\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n          --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n        - Add new configure option --enable-doxygen to enable\r\n          generation and installation of the liblzma API documentation\r\n          using Doxygen. Documentation in INSTALL and PACKAGERS was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n    CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Fix detection of Linux Landlock support. The detection code\r\n          in CMakeLists.txt had been sabotaged.\r\n\r\n        - Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match what\r\n          the Autotools build does. For example, symbol versioning\r\n          isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by setting\r\n          SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or \"linux\".\r\n\r\n        - Add support for all tests in typical build configurations.\r\n          Now the only difference to the tests coverage to Autotools\r\n          is that CMake-based build will skip more tests if features\r\n          are disabled. Such builds are only for special cases like\r\n          embedded systems.\r\n\r\n        - Separate the CMake code for the tests into tests/tests.cmake.\r\n          It is used conditionally, thus it is possible to\r\n\r\n              rm -rf tests\r\n\r\n          and the CMake-based build will still work normally except\r\n          that no tests are then available.\r\n\r\n        - Add a option ENABLE_DOXYGEN to enable generation and\r\n          installation of the liblzma API documentation using Doxygen.\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Omit the Doxygen-generated liblzma API documentation from the\r\n          package. Instead, the generation and installation of the API\r\n          docs can be enabled with a configure or CMake option if\r\n          Doxygen is available.\r\n\r\n        - Remove the XZ logo which was used in the API documentation.\r\n          The logo has been retired and isn't used by the project\r\n          anymore. However, it's OK to use it in contexts that refer\r\n          to the backdoor incident.\r\n\r\n        - Remove the PDF versions of the man pages from the source\r\n          package. These existed primarily for users of operating\r\n          systems which don't come with tools to render man page\r\n          source files. The plain text versions are still included\r\n          in doc/man/txt. PDF files can still be generated to doc/man,\r\n          if the required tools are available, using \"make pdf\" after\r\n          running \"configure\".\r\n\r\n        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on\r\n          tukaani.org.\r\n\r\n        - Update maintainer info.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - In tests/files/README, explain how to recreate the ARM64\r\n          test files.\r\n\r\n        - Remove two tests that used tiny x86 and SPARC object files\r\n          as the input files. The matching .c file was included but\r\n          the object files aren't easy to reproduce. The test cases\r\n          weren't great anyway; they were from the early days (2009)\r\n          of the project when the test suite had very few tests.\r\n\r\n        - Improve a few

5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2 have a build system issue that prevents building of shared libraries on some systems like mips64. See the patch itself for details. The same patch applies to 5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2.\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.4.7 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * Not changed: Memory sanitizer (MSAN) has a false positive\r\n      in the CRC CLMUL code which also makes OSS Fuzz unhappy.\r\n      Valgrind is smarter and doesn't complain.\r\n\r\n      A revision to the CLMUL code is coming anyway and this issue\r\n      will be cleaned up as part of it. It won't be backported to\r\n      5.6.x or 5.4.x because the old code isn't wrong. There is\r\n      no reason to risk introducing regressions in old branches\r\n      just to silence a false positive.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_str_to_filters(): Fix a missing output pointer\r\n          initialization (*error_pos = 0). This is very similar\r\n          to the fix above.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n          This newly showed up with Clang 17 with -fsanitize=undefined.\r\n          There are no bug reports about this.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n        - Fix outdated threading related information on the man page.\r\n\r\n    * xzless:\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 451 and later, use \"||-\" instead of \"|-\"\r\n          in the environment variable LESSOPEN. This way compressed\r\n          files that contain no uncompressed data are shown correctly\r\n          as empty.\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 632 and later, use --show-preproc-errors\r\n          to make \"less\" show a warning on decompression errors.\r\n\r\n    * Autotools-based build system (configure):\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n          --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n    CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Linux on MicroBlaze is handled specially now. This matches\r\n          the changes made to the Autotools-based build in XZ Utils\r\n          5.4.2 and 5.2.11.\r\n\r\n        - Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match what\r\n          the Autotools build does. For example, symbol versioning\r\n          isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by setting\r\n          SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or \"linux\".\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Clarify the description of --disable-assembler in INSTALL.\r\n          The option only affects 32-bit x86 assembly usage.\r\n\r\n        - Add doc/examples/11_file_info.c.

5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2 have a build system issue that prevents building of shared libraries on some systems like mips64. See the patch itself for details. The same patch applies to 5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2.\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.2.13 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_append(): Fix an assertion failure that could be\r\n          triggered by a large unpadded_size argument. It was verified\r\n          that there was no other bug than the assertion failure.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n          This newly showed up with Clang 17 with -fsanitize=undefined.\r\n          There are no bug reports about this.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with Windows Vista threads and --enable-small.\r\n          (CMake build doesn't support ENABLE_SMALL in XZ Utils 5.2.x.)\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Handle special files such as \"con\" or \"nul\". Earlier\r\n          the following wrote \"foo\" to the console and deleted the input\r\n          file \"con_xz\":\r\n\r\n              echo foo | xz > con_xz\r\n              xz --suffix=_xz --decompress con_xz\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Fix an issue that prevented reading from or writing\r\n          to non-terminal character devices like NUL.\r\n\r\n    * xzless:\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 451 and later, use \"||-\" instead of \"|-\"\r\n          in the environment variable LESSOPEN. This way compressed\r\n          files that contain no uncompressed data are shown correctly\r\n          as empty.\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 632 and later, use --show-preproc-errors\r\n          to make \"less\" show a warning on decompression errors.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Add a new line to liblzma.pc for MSYS2 (Windows):\r\n\r\n              Cflags.private: -DLZMA_API_STATIC\r\n\r\n          When compiling code that will link against static liblzma,\r\n          the LZMA_API_STATIC macro needs to be defined on Windows.\r\n\r\n        - Autotools (configure):\r\n\r\n            * Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n              --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n              updated to match.\r\n\r\n        - CMake:\r\n\r\n            * Fix a bug that prevented other projects from including\r\n              liblzma multiple times using find_package().\r\n\r\n            * Fix a bug where configuring CMake multiple times resulted\r\n              in HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME and HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC not being\r\n              defined.\r\n\r\n            * Fix the build with MinGW-w64-based Clang/LLVM 17.\r\n              llvm-windres now has more accurate GNU windres emulation\r\n              so the GNU windres workaround from 5.4.1 is needed with\r\n              llvm-windres version 17 too.\r\n\r\n            * The import library on Windows is now properly named\r\n              \"liblzma.dll.a\" instead of \"libliblzma.dll.a\"\r\n\r\n            * Add large file support by default for platforms that\r\n              need it to handle files larger than 2 GiB. This includes\r\n              MinGW-w64, even 64-bit builds.\r\n\r\n            * Linux on MicroBlaze is handled specially now. This\r\n              matches the changes made to the Autotools-based build\r\n              in XZ Utils 5.4.2 and 5.2.11.\r\n\r\n            * Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match\r\n              what the Autotools build does. For example, symbol\r\n              versioning isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n            * Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by\r\n              setting SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or\r\n              \"linux\".\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Clarify the description of --disable-assembler in INSTALL.\r\n          The option only affects 32-bit x86 assembly usage.\r\n\r\n        - Don't install the TODO file as part of the documentation.\r\n          The file is out of date.\r\n\r\n        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on\r\n          tukaani.org.\r\n\r\n        - Update maintainer

Esperanto.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/127520745/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/114816487","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/114816487/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/114816487/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.4.4","id":114816487,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4G1_Xn","tag_name":"v5.4.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

(2023-03-18)\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.2.11 that were not included in 5.4.1.\r\n\r\n    * If xz is built with support for the Capsicum sandbox but running\r\n      in an environment that doesn't support Capsicum, xz now runs\r\n      normally without sandboxing instead of exiting with an error.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Documentation was updated to improve the style, consistency,\r\n          and completeness of the liblzma API headers.\r\n\r\n        - The Doxygen-generated HTML documentation for the liblzma API\r\n          header files is now included in the source release and is\r\n          installed as part of \"make install\". All JavaScript is\r\n          removed to simplify license compliance and to reduce the\r\n          install size.\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a minor bug in lzma_str_from_filters() that produced\r\n          too many filters in the output string instead of reporting\r\n          an error if the input array had more than four filters. This\r\n          bug did not affect xz.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - autogen.sh now invokes the doxygen tool via the new wrapper\r\n          script doxygen/update-doxygen, unless the command line option\r\n          --no-doxygen is used.\r\n\r\n        - Added microlzma_encoder.c and microlzma_decoder.c to the\r\n          VS project files for Windows and to the CMake build. These\r\n          should have been included in 5.3.2alpha.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added a test to the CMake build that was forgotten in the\r\n          previous release.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.\r\n\r\n        - Added Brazilian Portuguese man page translation.\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079921/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.2.11","id":96079448,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4Fug5Y","tag_name":"v5.2.11","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

(2023-01-11)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed the return value of lzma_microlzma_encoder() if the\r\n          LZMA options lc/lp/pb are invalid. Invalid lc/lp/pb options\r\n          made the function return LZMA_STREAM_END without encoding\r\n          anything instead of returning LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - Windows / Visual Studio: Workaround a possible compiler bug\r\n          when targeting 32-bit x86 and compiling the CLMUL version of\r\n          the CRC64 code. The CLMUL code isn't enabled by the Windows\r\n          project files but it is in the CMake-based builds.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Windows-specific CMake changes:\r\n\r\n            * Don't try to enable CLMUL CRC64 code if _mm_set_epi64x()\r\n              isn't available. This fixes CMake-based build with Visual\r\n              Studio 2013.\r\n\r\n            * Created a workaround for a build failure with windres\r\n              from GNU binutils. It is used only when the C compiler\r\n              is GCC (not Clang). The workaround is incompatible\r\n              with llvm-windres, resulting in \"XZx20Utils\" instead\r\n              of \"XZ Utils\" in the resource file, but without the\r\n              workaround llvm-windres works correctly. See the\r\n              comment in CMakeLists.txt for details.\r\n\r\n            * Included the resource files in the xz and xzdec build\r\n              rules. Building the command line tools is still\r\n              experimental but possible with MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n        - Visual Studio: Added stream_decoder_mt.c to the project\r\n          files. Now the threaded decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt()\r\n          gets built. CMake-based build wasn't affected.\r\n\r\n        - Updated windows/INSTALL-MSVC.txt to mention that CMake-based\r\n          build is now the preferred method with Visual Studio. The\r\n          project files will probably be removed after 5.4.x releases.\r\n\r\n        - Changes to #defines in config.h:\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC. The old macro was always defined\r\n              in configure-generated config.h to either 0 or 1. The\r\n              new macro is defined (to 1) only if the declaration of\r\n              CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available. This matches the way most\r\n              other config.h macros work and makes things simpler with\r\n              other build systems.\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME for the same reason.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed test script compatibility with ancient /bin/sh\r\n          versions. Now the five test_compress_* tests should\r\n          no longer fail on Solaris 10.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Catalan

(2022-12-13)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.2.x and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    Since 5.3.5beta:\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.2.10.\r\n\r\n    * The ARM64 filter is now stable. The xz option is now --arm64.\r\n      Decompression requires XZ Utils 5.4.0. In the future the ARM64\r\n      filter will be supported by XZ for Java, XZ Embedded (including\r\n      the version in Linux), LZMA SDK, and 7-Zip.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated Catalan, Croatian, German, Romanian, and Turkish\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German man page translations.\r\n\r\n        - Added Romanian man page translations.\r\n\r\n    Summary of new features added in the 5.3.x development releases:\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Added threaded .xz decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt().\r\n          It can use multiple threads with .xz files that have multiple\r\n          Blocks with size information in Block Headers. The threaded\r\n          encoder in xz has always created such files.\r\n\r\n          Single-threaded encoder cannot store the size information in\r\n          Block Headers even if one used LZMA_FULL_FLUSH to create\r\n          multiple Blocks, so this threaded decoder cannot use multiple\r\n          threads with such files.\r\n\r\n          If there are multiple Streams (concatenated .xz files), one\r\n          Stream will be decompressed completely before starting the\r\n          next Stream.\r\n\r\n        - A new decoder flag LZMA_FAIL_FAST was added. It makes the\r\n          threaded decompressor report errors soon instead of first\r\n          flushing all pending data before the error location.\r\n\r\n        - New Filter IDs:\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_ARM64 is for ARM64 binaries.\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1EXT is for raw LZMA1 streams that don't\r\n              necessarily use the end marker.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_str_to_filters(), lzma_str_from_filters(), and\r\n          lzma_str_list_filters() to convert a preset or a filter chain\r\n          string to a lzma_filter[] and vice versa. These should make\r\n          it easier to write applications that allow users to specify\r\n          custom compression options.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_filters_free() which can be convenient for freeing\r\n          the filter options in a filter chain (an array of lzma_filter\r\n          structures).\r\n\r\n        - lzma_file_info_decoder() to makes it a little easier to get\r\n          the Index field from .xz files. This helps in getting the\r\n          uncompressed file size but an easy-to-use random access\r\n          API is still missing which has existed in XZ for Java for\r\n          a long time.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_microlzma_encoder() and lzma_microlzma_decoder().\r\n          It is used by erofs-utils and may be used by others too.\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA format is a raw LZMA stream (without end marker)\r\n          whose first byte (always 0x00) has been replaced with\r\n          bitwise-negation of the LZMA properties (lc/lp/pb). It was\r\n          created for use in EROFS but may be used in other contexts\r\n          as well where it is important to avoid wasting bytes for\r\n          stream headers or footers. The format is also supported by\r\n          XZ Embedded (the XZ Embedded version in Linux got MicroLZMA\r\n          support in Linux 5.16).\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA encoder API in liblzma can compress into a\r\n          fixed-sized output buffer so that as much data is compressed\r\n          as can be fit into the buffer while still creating a valid\r\n          MicroLZMA stream. This is needed for EROFS.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_lzip_decoder() to decompress the .lz (lzip) file\r\n          format version 0 and the original unextended version 1 files.\r\n          Also lzma_auto_decoder() supports .lz files.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_filters_update() can now be used with the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder (lzma_stream_encoder_mt()) to change the filter chain\r\n          after LZMA_FULL_BARRIER or LZMA_FULL_FLUSH.\r\n\r\n        - In lzma_options_lzma, allow nice_len = 2 and 3 with the match\r\n          finders that require at least 3 or 4. Now it is internally\r\n          rounded up if needed.\r\n\r\n        - CLMUL-based CRC64 on x86-64 and E2K with runtime processor\r\n          detection. On 32-bit x86 it currently isn't available unless\r\n          --disable-assembler is used which can make the non-CLMUL\r\n          CRC64 slower; this might be fixed in the future.\r\n\r\n        - Building with --disable-threads --enable-small\r\n          is now thread-safe if the compiler supports\r\n          __attribute__((__constructor__)).\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Using -T0 (--threads=0) will now use multi-threaded encoder\r\n          even on a single-core system. This is to ensure that output\r\n          from the same xz binary is identical on both single-core and\r\n          multi-core systems.\r\n\r\n        - --threads=+1 or -T+1 is now a way to put xz into\r\n          multi-threaded mode while using only one worker thread.\r\n          The + is ignored if the number is not 1.\r\n\r\n        - A default soft memory usage limit is now used for compression\r\n          when -T0 is used and no explicit limit has been specified.\r\n          This soft limit is used to restrict the number of threads\r\n          but if the limit is exceeded with even one thread then xz\r\n          will continue with one thread using the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder and this limit is ignored. If the number of threads\r\n          is specified manually then no default limit will be used;\r\n          this affects only -T0.\r\n\r\n          This change helps on systems that have very many cores and\r\n          using all of them for xz makes no sense. Previously xz -T0\r\n          could run out of memory on such systems because it attempted\r\n          to reserve memory for too many threads.\r\n\r\n          This also helps with 32-bit builds which don't have a large\r\n          amount of address space that would be required for many\r\n          threads. The default soft limit for -T0 is at most 1400 MiB\r\n          on all 32-bit platforms.\r\n\r\n        - Previously a low value in --memlimit-compress wouldn't cause\r\n          xz to switch from multi-threaded mode to single-threaded mode\r\n          if the limit cannot otherwise be met; xz failed instead. Now\r\n          xz can switch to single-threaded mode and then, if needed,\r\n          scale down the LZMA2 dictionary size too just like it already\r\n          did when it was started in single-threaded mode.\r\n\r\n        - The option --no-adjust no longer prevents xz from scaling down\r\n          the number of threads as that doesn't affect the compressed\r\n          output (only performance). Now --no-adjust only prevents\r\n          adjustments that affect compressed output, that is, with\r\n          --no-adjust xz won't switch from multi-threaded mode to\r\n          single-threaded mode and won't scale down the LZMA2\r\n          dictionary size.\r\n\r\n        - Added a new option --memlimit-mt-decompress=LIMIT. This is\r\n          used to limit the number of decompressor threads (possibly\r\n          falling back to single-threaded mode) but it will never make\r\n          xz refuse to decompress a file. This has a system-specific\r\n          default value because without any limit xz could end up\r\n          allocating memory for the whole compressed input file, the\r\n          whole uncompressed output file, multiple thread-specific\r\n          decompressor instances and so on. Basically xz could\r\n          attempt to use an insane amount of memory even with fairly\r\n          common files. The system-specific default value is currently\r\n          the same as the one used for compression with -T0.\r\n\r\n          The new option works together with the existing option\r\n          --memlimit-decompress=LIMIT. The old option sets a hard limit\r\n          that must not be exceeded (xz will refuse to decompress)\r\n          while the new option only restricts the number of threads.\r\n          If the limit set with --memlimit-mt-decompress is greater\r\n          than the limit set with --memlimit-compress, then the latter\r\n          value is used also for --memlimit-mt-decompress.\r\n\r\n        - Added new information to the output of xz --info-memory and\r\n          new fields to the output of xz --robot --info-memory.\r\n\r\n        - In --lzma2=nice=NUMBER allow 2 and 3 with all match finders\r\n          now that liblzma handles it.\r\n\r\n        - Don't mention endianness for ARM and ARM-Thumb filters in\r\n          --long-help. The filters only work for little endian\r\n          instruction encoding but modern ARM processors using\r\n          big endian data access still use little endian\r\n          instruction encoding. So the help text was misleading.\r\n          In contrast, the PowerPC filter is only for big endian\r\n          32/64-bit PowerPC code. Little endian PowerPC would need\r\n          a separate filter.\r\n\r\n        - Added decompression support for the .lz (lzip) file format\r\n          version 0 and the original unextended version 1. It is\r\n          autodetected by default. See also the option --format on\r\n          the xz man page.\r\n\r\n        - Sandboxing enabled by default:\r\n            * Capsicum (FreeBSD)\r\n            * pledge(2) (OpenBSD)\r\n\r\n    * Scripts now support the .lz format using xz.\r\n\r\n    * A few new tests were added.\r\n\r\n    * The liblzma-specific tests are now supported in CMake-based\r\n      builds too (\"make test\")."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.2.10","id":85934693,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4FH0Jl","tag_name":"v5.2.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"5.2.10
