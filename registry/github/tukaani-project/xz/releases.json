(2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * Remove the backdoor (CVE-2024-3094).\r\n\r\n    * Not changed: Memory sanitizer (MSAN) has a false positive\r\n      in the CRC CLMUL code which also makes OSS Fuzz unhappy.\r\n      Valgrind is smarter and doesn't complain.\r\n\r\n      A revision to the CLMUL code is coming anyway and this issue\r\n      will be cleaned up as part of it. It won't be backported to\r\n      5.6.x or 5.4.x because the old code isn't wrong. There is\r\n      no reason to risk introducing regressions in old branches\r\n      just to silence a false positive.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_str_to_filters(): Fix a missing output pointer\r\n          initialization (*error_pos = 0). This is very similar\r\n          to the fix above.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n\r\n        - Remove GNU indirect function (IFUNC) support. This is *NOT*\r\n          done for security reasons even though the backdoor relied on\r\n          this code. The performance benefits of IFUNC are too tiny in\r\n          this project to make the extra complexity worth it.\r\n\r\n        - FreeBSD on ARM64: Add error checking to CRC32 instruction\r\n          support detection.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n    * xzdec: Add support for Linux Landlock ABI version 4. xz already\r\n      had the v3-to-v4 change but it had been forgotten from xzdec.\r\n\r\n    * Autotools-based build system (configure):\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n          --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n        - Add new configure option --enable-doxygen to enable\r\n          generation and installation of the liblzma API documentation\r\n          using Doxygen. Documentation in INSTALL and PACKAGERS was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n    CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Fix detection of Linux Landlock support. The detection code\r\n          in CMakeLists.txt had been sabotaged.\r\n\r\n        - Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match what\r\n          the Autotools build does. For example, symbol versioning\r\n          isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by setting\r\n          SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or \"linux\".\r\n\r\n        - Add support for all tests in typical build configurations.\r\n          Now the only difference to the tests coverage to Autotools\r\n          is that CMake-based build will skip more tests if features\r\n          are disabled. Such builds are only for special cases like\r\n          embedded systems.\r\n\r\n        - Separate the CMake code for the tests into tests/tests.cmake.\r\n          It is used conditionally, thus it is possible to\r\n\r\n              rm -rf tests\r\n\r\n          and the CMake-based build will still work normally except\r\n          that no tests are then available.\r\n\r\n        - Add a option ENABLE_DOXYGEN to enable generation and\r\n          installation of the liblzma API documentation using Doxygen.\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Omit the Doxygen-generated liblzma API documentation from the\r\n          package. Instead, the generation and installation of the API\r\n          docs can be enabled with a configure or CMake option if\r\n          Doxygen is available.\r\n\r\n        - Remove the XZ logo which was used in the API documentation.\r\n          The logo has been retired and isn't used by the project\r\n          anymore. However, it's OK to use it in contexts that refer\r\n          to the backdoor incident.\r\n\r\n        - Remove the PDF versions of the man pages from the source\r\n          package. These existed primarily for users of operating\r\n          systems which don't come with tools to render man page\r\n          source files. The plain text versions are still included\r\n          in doc/man/txt. PDF files can still be generated to doc/man,\r\n          if the required tools are available, using \"make pdf\" after\r\n          running \"configure\".\r\n\r\n        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on\r\n          tukaani.org.\r\n\r\n        - Update maintainer info.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - In tests/files/README, explain how to recreate the ARM64\r\n          test files.\r\n\r\n        - Remove two tests that used tiny x86 and SPARC object files\r\n          as the input files. The matching .c file was included but\r\n          the object files aren't easy to reproduce. The test cases\r\n          weren't great anyway; they were from the early days (2009)\r\n          of the project when the test suite had very few tests.\r\n\r\n        - Improve a few

(2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * Not changed: Memory sanitizer (MSAN) has a false positive\r\n      in the CRC CLMUL code which also makes OSS Fuzz unhappy.\r\n      Valgrind is smarter and doesn't complain.\r\n\r\n      A revision to the CLMUL code is coming anyway and this issue\r\n      will be cleaned up as part of it. It won't be backported to\r\n      5.6.x or 5.4.x because the old code isn't wrong. There is\r\n      no reason to risk introducing regressions in old branches\r\n      just to silence a false positive.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_str_to_filters(): Fix a missing output pointer\r\n          initialization (*error_pos = 0). This is very similar\r\n          to the fix above.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n          This newly showed up with Clang 17 with -fsanitize=undefined.\r\n          There are no bug reports about this.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n        - Fix outdated threading related information on the man page.\r\n\r\n    * xzless:\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 451 and later, use \"||-\" instead of \"|-\"\r\n          in the environment variable LESSOPEN. This way compressed\r\n          files that contain no uncompressed data are shown correctly\r\n          as empty.\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 632 and later, use --show-preproc-errors\r\n          to make \"less\" show a warning on decompression errors.\r\n\r\n    * Autotools-based build system (configure):\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n          --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n          updated to match.\r\n\r\n    CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Linux on MicroBlaze is handled specially now. This matches\r\n          the changes made to the Autotools-based build in XZ Utils\r\n          5.4.2 and 5.2.11.\r\n\r\n        - Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match what\r\n          the Autotools build does. For example, symbol versioning\r\n          isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by setting\r\n          SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or \"linux\".\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Clarify the description of --disable-assembler in INSTALL.\r\n          The option only affects 32-bit x86 assembly usage.\r\n\r\n        - Add doc/examples/11_file_info.c. It was added to the\r\n          Git repository in 2017 but forgotten to be added into\r\n          distribution tarballs.\r\n\r\n        - Don't install the TODO file as part of the documentation.\r\n          The file is out of date.\r\n\r\n        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on\r\n          tukaani.org.\r\n\r\n        - Update maintainer

(2024-05-29)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_append(): Fix an assertion failure that could be\r\n          triggered by a large unpadded_size argument. It was verified\r\n          that there was no other bug than the assertion failure.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix\r\n          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the\r\n          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs\r\n          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice\r\n          this matters very little because the problem can only occur\r\n          if the calling application has a bug and these functions\r\n          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.\r\n          This newly showed up with Clang 17 with -fsanitize=undefined.\r\n          There are no bug reports about this.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.\r\n\r\n        - Fix building with Windows Vista threads and --enable-small.\r\n          (CMake build doesn't support ENABLE_SMALL in XZ Utils 5.2.x.)\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing\r\n          (arithmetic on a null pointer).\r\n\r\n        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:\r\n          \"warning: cannot select font 'CW'\"\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Handle special files such as \"con\" or \"nul\". Earlier\r\n          the following wrote \"foo\" to the console and deleted the input\r\n          file \"con_xz\":\r\n\r\n              echo foo | xz > con_xz\r\n              xz --suffix=_xz --decompress con_xz\r\n\r\n        - Windows: Fix an issue that prevented reading from or writing\r\n          to non-terminal character devices like NUL.\r\n\r\n    * xzless:\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 451 and later, use \"||-\" instead of \"|-\"\r\n          in the environment variable LESSOPEN. This way compressed\r\n          files that contain no uncompressed data are shown correctly\r\n          as empty.\r\n\r\n        - With \"less\" version 632 and later, use --show-preproc-errors\r\n          to make \"less\" show a warning on decompression errors.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Add a new line to liblzma.pc for MSYS2 (Windows):\r\n\r\n              Cflags.private: -DLZMA_API_STATIC\r\n\r\n          When compiling code that will link against static liblzma,\r\n          the LZMA_API_STATIC macro needs to be defined on Windows.\r\n\r\n        - Autotools (configure):\r\n\r\n            * Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with\r\n              --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was\r\n              updated to match.\r\n\r\n        - CMake:\r\n\r\n            * Fix a bug that prevented other projects from including\r\n              liblzma multiple times using find_package().\r\n\r\n            * Fix a bug where configuring CMake multiple times resulted\r\n              in HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME and HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC not being\r\n              defined.\r\n\r\n            * Fix the build with MinGW-w64-based Clang/LLVM 17.\r\n              llvm-windres now has more accurate GNU windres emulation\r\n              so the GNU windres workaround from 5.4.1 is needed with\r\n              llvm-windres version 17 too.\r\n\r\n            * The import library on Windows is now properly named\r\n              \"liblzma.dll.a\" instead of \"libliblzma.dll.a\"\r\n\r\n            * Add large file support by default for platforms that\r\n              need it to handle files larger than 2 GiB. This includes\r\n              MinGW-w64, even 64-bit builds.\r\n\r\n            * Linux on MicroBlaze is handled specially now. This\r\n              matches the changes made to the Autotools-based build\r\n              in XZ Utils 5.4.2 and 5.2.11.\r\n\r\n            * Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match\r\n              what the Autotools build does. For example, symbol\r\n              versioning isn't enabled with musl.\r\n\r\n            * Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by\r\n              setting SYMBOL_VERSIONING to \"OFF\", \"generic\", or\r\n              \"linux\".\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Clarify the description of --disable-assembler in INSTALL.\r\n          The option only affects 32-bit x86 assembly usage.\r\n\r\n        - Don't install the TODO file as part of the documentation.\r\n          The file is out of date.\r\n\r\n        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on\r\n          tukaani.org.\r\n\r\n        - Update maintainer info.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/158033818/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654891","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654891/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654891/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.4.6","id":138654891,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4IQ7Sr","tag_name":"v5.4.6","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

support Capsicum, xz now runs\r\n      normally without sandboxing instead of exiting with an error.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Documentation was updated to improve the style, consistency,\r\n          and completeness of the liblzma API headers.\r\n\r\n        - The Doxygen-generated HTML documentation for the liblzma API\r\n          header files is now included in the source release and is\r\n          installed as part of \"make install\". All JavaScript is\r\n          removed to simplify license compliance and to reduce the\r\n          install size.\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a minor bug in lzma_str_from_filters() that produced\r\n          too many filters in the output string instead of reporting\r\n          an error if the input array had more than four filters. This\r\n          bug did not affect xz.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - autogen.sh now invokes the doxygen tool via the new wrapper\r\n          script doxygen/update-doxygen, unless the command line option\r\n          --no-doxygen is used.\r\n\r\n        - Added microlzma_encoder.c and microlzma_decoder.c to the\r\n          VS project files for Windows and to the CMake build. These\r\n          should have been included in 5.3.2alpha.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added a test to the CMake build that was forgotten in the\r\n          previous release.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.\r\n\r\n        - Added Brazilian Portuguese man page translation.\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079921/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/96079448/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.2.11","id":96079448,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4Fug5Y","tag_name":"v5.2.11","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

(2023-01-11)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed the return value of lzma_microlzma_encoder() if the\r\n          LZMA options lc/lp/pb are invalid. Invalid lc/lp/pb options\r\n          made the function return LZMA_STREAM_END without encoding\r\n          anything instead of returning LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - Windows / Visual Studio: Workaround a possible compiler bug\r\n          when targeting 32-bit x86 and compiling the CLMUL version of\r\n          the CRC64 code. The CLMUL code isn't enabled by the Windows\r\n          project files but it is in the CMake-based builds.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Windows-specific CMake changes:\r\n\r\n            * Don't try to enable CLMUL CRC64 code if _mm_set_epi64x()\r\n              isn't available. This fixes CMake-based build with Visual\r\n              Studio 2013.\r\n\r\n            * Created a workaround for a build failure with windres\r\n              from GNU binutils. It is used only when the C compiler\r\n              is GCC (not Clang). The workaround is incompatible\r\n              with llvm-windres, resulting in \"XZx20Utils\" instead\r\n              of \"XZ Utils\" in the resource file, but without the\r\n              workaround llvm-windres works correctly. See the\r\n              comment in CMakeLists.txt for details.\r\n\r\n            * Included the resource files in the xz and xzdec build\r\n              rules. Building the command line tools is still\r\n              experimental but possible with MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n        - Visual Studio: Added stream_decoder_mt.c to the project\r\n          files. Now the threaded decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt()\r\n          gets built. CMake-based build wasn't affected.\r\n\r\n        - Updated windows/INSTALL-MSVC.txt to mention that CMake-based\r\n          build is now the preferred method with Visual Studio. The\r\n          project files will probably be removed after 5.4.x releases.\r\n\r\n        - Changes to #defines in config.h:\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC. The old macro was always defined\r\n              in configure-generated config.h to either 0 or 1. The\r\n              new macro is defined (to 1) only if the declaration of\r\n              CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available. This matches the way most\r\n              other config.h macros work and makes things simpler with\r\n              other build systems.\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME for the same reason.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed test script compatibility with ancient /bin/sh\r\n          versions. Now the five test_compress_* tests should\r\n          no longer fail on Solaris 10.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Catalan

(2022-12-13)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.2.x and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    Since 5.3.5beta:\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.2.10.\r\n\r\n    * The ARM64 filter is now stable. The xz option is now --arm64.\r\n      Decompression requires XZ Utils 5.4.0. In the future the ARM64\r\n      filter will be supported by XZ for Java, XZ Embedded (including\r\n      the version in Linux), LZMA SDK, and 7-Zip.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated Catalan, Croatian, German, Romanian, and Turkish\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German man page translations.\r\n\r\n        - Added Romanian man page translations.\r\n\r\n    Summary of new features added in the 5.3.x development releases:\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Added threaded .xz decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt().\r\n          It can use multiple threads with .xz files that have multiple\r\n          Blocks with size information in Block Headers. The threaded\r\n          encoder in xz has always created such files.\r\n\r\n          Single-threaded encoder cannot store the size information in\r\n          Block Headers even if one used LZMA_FULL_FLUSH to create\r\n          multiple Blocks, so this threaded decoder cannot use multiple\r\n          threads with such files.\r\n\r\n          If there are multiple Streams (concatenated .xz files), one\r\n          Stream will be decompressed completely before starting the\r\n          next Stream.\r\n\r\n        - A new decoder flag LZMA_FAIL_FAST was added. It makes the\r\n          threaded decompressor report errors soon instead of first\r\n          flushing all pending data before the error location.\r\n\r\n        - New Filter IDs:\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_ARM64 is for ARM64 binaries.\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1EXT is for raw LZMA1 streams that don't\r\n              necessarily use the end marker.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_str_to_filters(), lzma_str_from_filters(), and\r\n          lzma_str_list_filters() to convert a preset or a filter chain\r\n          string to a lzma_filter[] and vice versa. These should make\r\n          it easier to write applications that allow users to specify\r\n          custom compression options.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_filters_free() which can be convenient for freeing\r\n          the filter options in a filter chain (an array of lzma_filter\r\n          structures).\r\n\r\n        - lzma_file_info_decoder() to makes it a little easier to get\r\n          the Index field from .xz files. This helps in getting the\r\n          uncompressed file size but an easy-to-use random access\r\n          API is still missing which has existed in XZ for Java for\r\n          a long time.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_microlzma_encoder() and lzma_microlzma_decoder().\r\n          It is used by erofs-utils and may be used by others too.\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA format is a raw LZMA stream (without end marker)\r\n          whose first byte (always 0x00) has been replaced with\r\n          bitwise-negation of the LZMA properties (lc/lp/pb). It was\r\n          created for use in EROFS but may be used in other contexts\r\n          as well where it is important to avoid wasting bytes for\r\n          stream headers or footers. The format is also supported by\r\n          XZ Embedded (the XZ Embedded version in Linux got MicroLZMA\r\n          support in Linux 5.16).\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA encoder API in liblzma can compress into a\r\n          fixed-sized output buffer so that as much data is compressed\r\n          as can be fit into the buffer while still creating a valid\r\n          MicroLZMA stream. This is needed for EROFS.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_lzip_decoder() to decompress the .lz (lzip) file\r\n          format version 0 and the original unextended version 1 files.\r\n          Also lzma_auto_decoder() supports .lz files.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_filters_update() can now be used with the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder (lzma_stream_encoder_mt()) to change the filter chain\r\n          after LZMA_FULL_BARRIER or LZMA_FULL_FLUSH.\r\n\r\n        - In lzma_options_lzma, allow nice_len = 2 and 3 with the match\r\n          finders that require at least 3 or 4. Now it is internally\r\n          rounded up if needed.\r\n\r\n        - CLMUL-based CRC64 on x86-64 and E2K with runtime processor\r\n          detection. On 32-bit x86 it currently isn't available unless\r\n          --disable-assembler is used which can make the non-CLMUL\r\n          CRC64 slower; this might be fixed in the future.\r\n\r\n        - Building with --disable-threads --enable-small\r\n          is now thread-safe if the compiler supports\r\n          __attribute__((__constructor__)).\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Using -T0 (--threads=0) will now use multi-threaded encoder\r\n          even on a single-core system. This is to ensure that output\r\n          from the same xz binary is identical on both single-core and\r\n          multi-core systems.\r\n\r\n        - --threads=+1 or -T+1 is now a way to put xz into\r\n          multi-threaded mode while using only one worker thread.\r\n          The + is ignored if the number is not 1.\r\n\r\n        - A default soft memory usage limit is now used for compression\r\n          when -T0 is used and no explicit limit has been specified.\r\n          This soft limit is used to restrict the number of threads\r\n          but if the limit is exceeded with even one thread then xz\r\n          will continue with one thread using the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder and this limit is ignored. If the number of threads\r\n          is specified manually then no default limit will be used;\r\n          this affects only -T0.\r\n\r\n          This change helps on systems that have very many cores and\r\n          using all of them for xz makes no sense. Previously xz -T0\r\n          could run out of memory on such systems because it attempted\r\n          to reserve memory for too many threads.\r\n\r\n          This also helps with 32-bit builds which don't have a large\r\n          amount of address space that would be required for many\r\n          threads. The default soft limit for -T0 is at most 1400 MiB\r\n          on all 32-bit platforms.\r\n\r\n        - Previously a low value in --memlimit-compress wouldn't cause\r\n          xz to switch from multi-threaded mode to single-threaded mode\r\n          if the limit cannot otherwise be met; xz failed instead. Now\r\n          xz can switch to single-threaded mode and then, if needed,\r\n          scale down the LZMA2 dictionary size too just like it already\r\n          did when it was started in single-threaded mode.\r\n\r\n        - The option --no-adjust no longer prevents xz from scaling down\r\n          the number of threads as that doesn't affect the compressed\r\n          output (only performance). Now --no-adjust only prevents\r\n          adjustments that affect compressed output, that is, with\r\n          --no-adjust xz won't switch from multi-threaded mode to\r\n          single-threaded mode and won't scale down the LZMA2\r\n          dictionary size.\r\n\r\n        - Added a new option --memlimit-mt-decompress=LIMIT. This is\r\n          used to limit the number of decompressor threads (possibly\r\n          falling back to single-threaded mode) but it will never make\r\n          xz refuse to decompress a file. This has a system-specific\r\n          default value because without any limit xz could end up\r\n          allocating memory for the whole compressed input file, the\r\n          whole uncompressed output file, multiple thread-specific\r\n          decompressor instances and so on. Basically xz could\r\n          attempt to use an insane amount of memory even with fairly\r\n          common files. The system-specific default value is currently\r\n          the same as the one used for compression with -T0.\r\n\r\n          The new option works together with the existing option\r\n          --memlimit-decompress=LIMIT. The old option sets a hard limit\r\n          that must not be exceeded (xz will refuse to decompress)\r\n          while the new option only restricts the number of threads.\r\n          If the limit set with --memlimit-mt-decompress is greater\r\n          than the limit set with --memlimit-compress, then the latter\r\n          value is used also for --memlimit-mt-decompress.\r\n\r\n        - Added new information to the output of xz --info-memory and\r\n          new fields to the output of xz --robot --info-memory.\r\n\r\n        - In --lzma2=nice=NUMBER allow 2 and 3 with all match finders\r\n          now that liblzma handles it.\r\n\r\n        - Don't mention endianness for ARM and ARM-Thumb filters in\r\n          --long-help. The filters only work for little endian\r\n          instruction encoding but modern ARM processors using\r\n          big endian data access still use little endian\r\n          instruction encoding. So the help text was misleading.\r\n          In contrast, the PowerPC filter is only for big endian\r\n          32/64-bit PowerPC code. Little endian PowerPC would need\r\n          a separate filter.\r\n\r\n        - Added decompression support for the .lz (lzip) file format\r\n          version 0 and the original unextended version 1. It is\r\n          autodetected by default. See also the option --format on\r\n          the xz man page.\r\n\r\n        - Sandboxing enabled by default:\r\n            * Capsicum (FreeBSD)\r\n            * pledge(2) (OpenBSD)\r\n\r\n    * Scripts now support the .lz format using xz.\r\n\r\n    * A few new tests were added.\r\n\r\n    * The liblzma-specific tests are now supported in CMake-based\r\n      builds too (\"make test\")."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.2.10","id":85934693,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4FH0Jl","tag_name":"v5.2.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"5.2.10
