The size of the\n  improvement depends on the microarchitecture, but I've benchmarked\n  ~1.3x on a Cortex-A53 and ~1.2x on an Apple M1. Contributed by\n  @sdlyyxy in #319.\n- The MSRV is now 1.66.1 for both the `blake3` crate and `b3sum`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/111331357/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":4,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/107888485","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/107888485/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/107888485/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/tag/1.4.0","id":107888485,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODSjRes4Gbj9l","tag_name":"1.4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.4.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-06-08T20:06:32Z","published_at":"2023-06-08T20:24:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/111909929","id":111909929,"node_id":"RA_kwDODSjRes4Gq5wp","name":"b3sum_linux_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":5631528,"download_count":268,"created_at":"2023-06-08T20:24:45Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T20:24:46Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/1.4.0/b3sum_linux_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/111910022","id":111910022,"node_id":"RA_kwDODSjRes4Gq5yG","name":"b3sum_macos_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":1464336,"download_count":12,"created_at":"2023-06-08T20:25:31Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T20:25:32Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/1.4.0/b3sum_macos_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE

1.2.0\n\nChanges since 1.1.0:\n- SECURITY FIX: Fixed an instance of undefined behavior in the Windows\n  SSE2 assembly implementations, which affected both the Rust and C\n  libraries in their default build configurations. See\n  https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/issues/206. The cause was a\n  vector register that wasn't properly saved and restored. This bug has\n  been present since SSE2 support was initially added in v0.3.7. The\n  effects of this bug depend on surrounding code and compiler\n  optimizations; see test_issue_206_windows_sse2 for an example of this\n  bug causing incorrect hash output. Note that even when surrounding\n  code is arranged to trigger this bug, the SSE2 implementation is\n  normally only invoked on CPUs where SSE4.1 (introduced in 2007) isn't\n  supported. One notable exception, however, is if the Rust library is\n  built in `no_std` mode, with `default_features = false` or similar. In\n  that case, runtime CPU feature detection is disabled, and since LLVM\n  assumes that all x86-64 targets support SSE2, the SSE2 implementation\n  will be invoked. For that reason, Rust callers who build `blake3` in\n  `no_std` mode for x86-64 Windows targets are the most likely to\n  trigger this bug. We found this bug in internal testing, and we aren't\n  aware of any callers encountering it in practice.\n- Added the Hasher::count() method."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/51824150","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/51824150/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/51824150/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/tag/1.1.0","id":51824150,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODSjRes4DFsYW","tag_name":"1.1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.1.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-10-21T21:23:51Z","published_at":"2021-10-21T21:42:19Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/47573784","id":47573784,"node_id":"RA_kwDODSjRes4C1esY","name":"b3sum_linux_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":4811232,"download_count":1660,"created_at":"2021-10-21T21:42:20Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T21:42:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/1.1.0/b3sum_linux_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/47573863","id":47573863,"node_id":"RA_kwDODSjRes4C1etn","name":"b3sum_macos_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":1366912,"download_count":13,"created_at":"2021-10-21T21:42:45Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T21:42:45Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/1.1.0/b3sum_macos_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/47573916","id":47573916,"node_id":"RA_kwDODSjRes4C1euc","name":"b3sum_windows_x64_bin.exe","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url"

1.1.0\n\nChanges since 1.0.0:\n- The NEON implementation is now enabled by default on AArch64 targets.\n  Previously it was disabled without the \"neon\" Cargo feature in Rust or\n  the \"BLAKE3_USE_NEON=1\" preprocessor flag in C. This is still the case\n  on ARM targets other than AArch64, because of the lack of dynamic CPU\n  feature detection on ARM. Contributed by @rsdy.\n- The previous change leads to some build incompatibilities,\n  particularly in C. If you build the C implementation for AArch64\n  targets, you now need to include blake3_neon.c, or else you'll get a\n  linker error like \"undefined reference to `blake3_hash_many_neon'\". If\n  you don't want the NEON implementation, you need to explicitly set\n  \"BLAKE3_USE_NEON=0\". On the Rust side, AArch64 targets now require the\n  C toolchain by default. build.rs includes workarounds for missing or\n  very old C compilers for x86, but it doesn't currently include such\n  workarounds for AArch64. If we hear about build breaks related to\n  this, we can add more workarounds as appropriate.\n- C-specific Git tags (\"c-0.3.7\" etc.) have been removed, and all the\n  projects in this repo (Rust

1.0.0\n\nChanges since 0.3.8:\n- Add Hash::from_hex() and implement FromStr for Hash.\n- Implement Display for Hash, equivalent to Hash::to_hex().\n- Implement PartialEq<[u8]> for Hash, using constant_time_eq.\n- Change derive_key() to return a 32-byte array. As with hash() and\n  keyed_hash(), callers who want a non-default output length can use\n  Hasher::finalize_xof().\n- Replace Hasher::update_with_join() with Hasher::update_rayon(). The\n  former was excessively generic, and the Join trait leaked\n  implementation details. As part of this change, the Join trait is no\n  longer public.\n- Upgraded arrayvec to 0.7.0, which uses const generics. This bumps the\n  minimum supported Rust compiler version to 1.51.\n- Gate the digest and crypto-mac trait implementations behind an\n  unstable feature, \"traits-preview\".

0.11.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/46734078/reactions","total_count":59,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":44,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/43544609","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/43544609/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/43544609/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/tag/0.3.8","id":43544609,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQzNTQ0NjA5","tag_name":"0.3.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.3.8","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-05-25T15:14:21Z","published_at":"2021-05-25T16:22:44Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/37512611","id":37512611,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDM3NTEyNjEx","name":"b3sum_linux_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":4922800,"download_count":165,"created_at":"2021-05-25T16:22:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T16:22:45Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/0.3.8/b3sum_linux_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/assets/37512694","id":37512694,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDM3NTEyNjk0","name":"b3sum_macos_x64_bin","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":1353264,"download_count":36,"created_at":"2021-05-25T16:23:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T16:23:56Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/download/0.3.8/b3sum_macos_x64_bin"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLAKE3-team/B

0.3.7\n\nChanges since 0.3.6:\n- BUGFIX: The C implementation was incorrect on big endian systems for\n  inputs longer than 1024 bytes. This bug affected all previous versions\n  of the C implementation. Little endian platforms like x86 were\n  unaffected. The Rust implementation was also unaffected.\n  @jakub-zwolakowski and @pascal-cuoq from TrustInSoft reported this\n  bug: https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/pull/118\n- BUGFIX: The C build on x86-64 was producing binaries with an\n  executable stack. @tristanheaven reported this bug:\n  https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/issues/109\n- @mkrupcale added optimized implementations for SSE2. This improves\n  performance on older x86 processors that don't support SSE4.1.\n- The C implementation now exposes the\n  `blake3_hasher_init_derive_key_raw` function, to make it easier to\n  implement language bindings.
